"25 Oct, 2019",George Soros says all his enemies are wannabe dictators as he drops unprecedented wads of lobbying cash,"In the world of billionaire financier George Soros, his critics are would-be dictators who will not succeed  Meanwhile, under Trump, the Open Society founder has been pouring greater sums into lobbying than ever before  I m very proud of the enemies I have, he told the New York Times in an interview published Friday, in which he confidently predicted the popular opposition to his globalist philosophy was winding down and that a backlash against Trump-style nationalism was on the horizon  It s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would-be dictator, if he identifies me as an enemy  Soros slammed the US president as an aberration, predicting what he has done in the Middle East clearing troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, allowing peace to break out with a deal between Russia and Turkey will contribute to his demise next year  Trump has called out Soros in the past, accusing him of paying the protesters who swarmed the Capitol over Justice Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court and hinting that he was bankrolling the migrant caravans that swarmed the US southern border last year  Soros is a popular villain among conservatives, who suspect that, after funding color revolutions in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, he is trying to start one in the US  The currency speculation that has made him enemies from Malaysia to Britain has also made him rich enough to contribute billions toward funding what are usually described as progressive causes through his Open Society Foundations  And he is spending more than ever on those causes, dumping some $15 9 million to influence Congress in just the third quarter of 2019 via his foundation s lobbying division, the Open Society Policy Center, according to a recent filing  It s a jump even over the group s 2018 expenditures, which, at $31 5 million, made it the third-largest lobbying group that year  Only the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors outspent the billionaire  Aside from lobbying, Soros spreads his money around liberally in more ways than one  He has funded media organizations like Democracy Now! and Media Matters, pro-immigration groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Migration Policy Institute, think tanks like the Aspen Institute and the Center for American Progress, fundraising organizations like MoveOn org that stages anti-Trump protests, and interventionist policy groups like the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect  He has already donated millions to the Democratic Party for 2020  There are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets, he said, calling Elizabeth Warren who wants to tax the wealthy heavily the most qualified person to be president  Soros also has a""mortal enemy""- China,   the nation that fought a winning battle against his currency speculating in 1998, so now he calls Xi Jinping s China the worst threat to an open society  Given what has happened to the other societies Soros has poured money into, Xi might take that as a compliment  ",https://www.rt.com/usa/471880-soros-enemies-dictators-lobbying-china/
"5 Jul, 2019",Gangster mayors and oligarch s dirty money: Will former criminals hold on to power in Ukraine?,"As Ukraine braces for an early parliamentary vote, its political elites are desperately looking for ways to forge alliances that would be of benefit in the new political environment  Some deals, however, look shadier than others  While Ukraine s major political parties led by former President Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are preparing to face off, as well as the newly formed party of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a parliamentary election, some political figures with a long criminal history also want a piece of the pie  One of the leaders of the newlyformed Opposition Bloc who made it to the top of its election list, Gennady Trukhanov, appears to have a particularly gruesome criminal history behind him  Since 2014, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odessa Ukraine s largest port and the third most populous city  He is a political veteran who has been building his career in Ukraine s upper echelons of power for about a decade and a half  Yet, his fine appearance hides the fact that he was once a member of a notorious gang which was allegedly involved in smuggling arms and drugs  According to a 2018 BBCreport, the gang, which came into being in the 1990s, was linked to some particularly gruesome murders  Trukhanov, who is involved in martial arts and has been thepresidentof the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation of Muay Thai since 2003, trained members of the gang in hand-to-hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons, the BBC said, citing data from Italian police  A reportcompiledby Italian law enforcement in the late 1990s names Trukhanov as one of the leaders of the gang who had extensive contacts with Ukrainian law enforcement  He was also said to enjoy close ties with another gang leader a notorious crime lord called Aleksandr Angert, aka Sasha Angel  Angert was sentenced to 15 years in prison for premeditated murder in 1980, but was released 10 years later as he was allegedly suffering from stomach cancer, which, however, apparently did not stop him from taking a leading role in another gang along with Trukhanov  Later, Angert, one of Odessa s most influential crime lords, moved to London, where he has lived ever since and allegedly moved from crime to business, dissolving his gangs  However, he reportedlyretainedhis close ties with his now business partner Trukhanov  The criminal-turned-mayor, meanwhile, apparently did not wipe the slate clean after moving away from gang activities  A 2016reportby the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), citing the Panama Papers, revealed that the mayor owns an entire business empire in Ukraine controlled through offshore firms registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is actively involved in embezzlement and money laundering  Another Opposition Bloc leader who found his way to the top of the election list is Gennady Kernes, the longstanding mayor of Kharkov  For about two decades, he has ruled over the nation s second most populous city (almost 1 5 million people), also a large industrial and science center  He managed to retain his post through a range of political cataclysms, from the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought Yushchenko to power, to the 2014 Maidan coup  He has, however, a few skeletons in the closet  According to an extensivereportpublished by an investigative media project called Criminal Ukraine , the now respectable mayor started his career in the 1990s as a fraudster, whose gang ran several shady schemes  Eventually, they decided to expand their business and move from fraud to blackmail and extortion  Kernes gang was even suspected of murder at one point, but those charges were apparently not proven  Eventually, Kernes (nicknamed Gepa) was arrested, but only sentenced to three years in prison, and was set free two years later due to active repentance  Following his release, the future mayor turned to privatization and managed to obtain quite a number of assets in Kharkov, including factories and real estate, through shady schemes, eventually emerging as a wealthy businessman  Later, he allegedly used his influence to exert pressure on his political rivals and to gag journalists who dared to mention his criminal past in their reports  Kharkov Region is located right next to the tumultuous Eastern Ukrainian regions, parts of which refused to recognize Kiev s authority following the 2014 Maidan coup and declared themselves the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics (DPR and LPR)  As Kiev still struggles to regain control over the rebellious Donbass republics, having people like Kernes and Trukhanov at the helm of the regional governments will hardly give it much legitimacy in the eyes of the people there  Other Ukrainian media reports suggest that Kernes enjoys close ties to controversial Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who is suspected by some of being the real puppet master behind Zelensky s recent landslide victory in the presidential election  KernesvisitedKolomoisky in Israel ahead of the presidential runoff, according to one such report  The billionaire dismissed the idea of any hidden agenda behind the trip, telling the media that Kernes went to Israel for medical reasons and met him by coincidence  Kolomoisky, an oligarch who made a fortune during the privatization frenzy in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, might yet turn out to be the one pulling the strings in the newly-formed political bloc  A sort of Ukrainian George Soros, Kolomoisky gained a reputation of being a shadowy figure seeking to influence politics  Unlike Soros, he does not seem to have any particular ideological preference  Instead, he apparently tries to place his millions on the winning horse  Over the last decade and a half, he has supported the Orange Revolution, former President Viktor Yushchenko, and then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  He attained particular infamy in the wake of the Maidan coup, when he created his own paramilitary force bysponsoringanti-Russia battalions  Kolomoisky initially financed the notorious ultranationalist Azov Battalion for months in 2014  He is now reportedly one of the major backers of the Opposition Bloc  He does not really hide this fact either  In May, headmittedhe was consulting the party created by Trukhanov and Kernes, which he called an All-Ukrainian project  He also held talks with a leader of another party that eventually joined the bloc  We have common issues  The commercial and political ones, he told Ukrainian Pravda back then, adding that some unsuccessful projects need a reboot  The billionaire specifically mentioned aligning forces and creating a broader agenda as a recipe for moving forward  Kernes then rushed todownplaythe oligarch s influence on his party by saying that he neither financed nor consulted the party, while calling his contacts with Kolomoisky a private matter  As Zelensky s presidential victory clearly shows that Ukrainians have grown tired of the old political ways, tainted by corrupt elites linked to organized crime, he has apparently embraced the idea of rebranding and renewal at least on the surface  Whether the dark past will still loom over the bright future they claim to offer remains to be seen  Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won t tell you  ",https://www.rt.com/news/463480-ukraine-criminals-political-power-retain/

Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda--they don't get to continue setting it like the election never happened  In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically-elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the""reduction or lifting""of sanctions on Russia by Western powers  He may not take any action""delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting""the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine  Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with""the IMF and other foreign partners "" It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though  The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti-Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious ""de-communization which banned Soviet symbols in the country  Ironically, this push for de-communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti-Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy  The NGOs insist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another 'red line' among their national identity demands  Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian?

"22 May, 2019",Is Soros-linked Avaaz group a credible source on fake news? Mainstream media seems to think so,"Mainstream news outlets have eagerly reported on a study by the Avaaz campaign group, claiming far-right disinformation groups have been spreading fake news in the lead up to EU elections  but is the group all that it seems? The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere and it s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far-right and anti-EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections  The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right-wing and anti-establishment groups and parties  and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial  Be like Captain Von Trapp - reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week  EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23-26!pic twitter com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls  but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non-partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different  Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning  While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon org (which has been partly funded by left-wing Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros)  and its co-founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda  Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello  Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context? Independent journalists have had suspicions about Avaaz s own activity for years, noting its strong pro-establishment and globalist leanings, which have even translated into outward support for US regime change wars around the world  When the group is notpushingfor no-fly zones in LibyaandSyria, oragitatingfor regime change in Venezuela and Iran, it is actively supporting centrist, neoliberal political figures across the EU and US  Patel told the EUobserver last year that the majority of people across Europe stand with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has also activelysupportedFrench President Emmanuel Macron with online videos and petitions  While Avaaz is seemingly very concerned with the plight of citizens in places like Venezuela and Iran (it was also activelyinvolvedin promoting Iran s Green Revolution in 2009), it appears to be less concerned with the lives of ordinary Europeans  The group has targeted the anti-Macron Yellow Vest movement in France and  framed the protesters easy targets for spreading fake news  and to put the icing on the cake, blamed the swift spread of this alleged fake news on Russia, another of Avaaz s favorite targets  Indeed, unsurprisingly, media reporting on so-called election meddling ahead of EU elections has taken on an anti-Russia hue, with many suggesting that disinformation groups are simply copying Russian tactics from the 2016 US election, when the Democratic Party claimed Russian disinformation campaigns were a major factor in Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump  a claim for which there remains exactly zero evidence  One of these reports on the alleged copycat tactics quotes Ben Nimmo, a former NATO press officer, cited with regularity by mainstream journalists as though he is an impartial source  Like clockwork, Nimmo popped up ahead of the EU elections to claim that domestic actors across Europe are now simply doing what the Russians had already been doing  because it s easier to blame Russia for social discord in Europe than failed leadership and unpopular policies  Once again, it appears that many of the groups claiming to help people recognize fake news online are some of the biggest and sneakiest purveyors of disinformation themselves  and they are frequently promoted by mainstream news outlets  if they are selling the correct narrative, that is  Mainstream media continue to quote the founders of cybersecurity firm New Knowledge as credible experts on Russian disinformation tactics, even after the firm wasexposedby the New York Times for having run its own disinformation campaign during a 2017 Alabama senate race  The New Knowledge crowd set up fake Russian social media accounts to support one candidate and then worked to publicly brand him as Moscow s pick  By not even mentioning Avaaz s own sketchy links, and very clear political leanings, Western news reports citing its studies as completely credible and independent are simply engaging in their own kind of disinformation  ",https://www.rt.com/news/460010-avaaz-eu-elections-disinformation/

"25 Apr, 2019",Trump s envoy to Ukraine is paid by none other than Poroshenko himself,"US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker is drawing a salary from John McCain's think tank, which is funded by George Soros and a DC lobbying firm working for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, among others  Volker was appointed Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations in July 2017, by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and has been mediating the Ukrainian crisis on behalf of the US ever since in much the same way his colleagueElliott Abramshas been doing with Venezuela  The twist is that Volker is doing this on a voluntary basiswithout compensation and not taxing the taxpayers, drawing a salary from his day job as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Arizona  Named after the late and hawkish US senator John McCain, the think tank is dedicated to""advancing leadership in the United States and around the world ""The two positions are very much aligned, Volker has said, allowing him to get his""hands dirty and actually solve our problems "" In practice, that means things like taking part in the""Occupied Crimea: 5 years of resistance""conference in Odessa the same city where US-backed nationalists burned alive their political opponents in May 2014 and parroting Bellingcat talking points on the Kerch Strait incident, themselves cribbed from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)  The ðºð¸does not and will not accept Russia s claimed annexation of Crimea  ð·ðº has committed numerous human rights abuses in furtherance of its occupation  We will continue to maintain and strengthen sanctions until Crimea is returned #CrimeaisUkraine pic twitter com/dirC34locX Interesting analysis by Bellingcat with this key conclusion: the shooting of the Berdyansk most likely took place in international waters Investigating The Kerch Strait Incident via@bellingcathttPS: //t co/4dM9Ct8jXw This is not surprising, however, since thelist of donorsof the McCain Institute includes something called the BGR Foundation  It shares the same Washington, DC address and name with Barbour Griffith Rogers, a high-profile lobbying firm thatlists Volkeras Senior International Advisor and former international managing director  According toits filingsto the US Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), BGR is a registered agent for none other than President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, whose ascension to Ukrainian presidency was brought about by the Maidan revolution of 2014, a coup cheered on most fervently by John McCain himself  The National Reforms Council of Ukraine, which officially retained BGR's services, is led by none other than Dmytro Shymkiv, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine, as perthe filing BGR sentto the DOJ in January 2017  It remains to be seen whether this relationship will change in June, when TV personality Volodymyr Zelensky takes office, havingtriumphedin a landslide runoff election this past weekend  Judging by Zelensky sofficial Facebook accountof his February meeting with Volker a friend of Ukraine with whom he reached full understanding on all questions that seems unlikely, however  Volker was very close to the late Senator McCain, who was himself intimately involved with the 2014""revolution""in Kiev, visiting the demonstrators and personally sharing the stage with Socialist-Nationalist Party leader Oleg Tyahnibok, for example  McCain was evenoffered an advisory jobwith Poroshenko, back in 2015, but declined because that was not allowed under US law  Turns out another McCain confidant,David Kramer, also works at Volker s institute, listed as""senior director for Human Rights and Democracy ""Kramer wasidentifiedas the individual who during the 2016 campaign spread the""Steele Dossier""(accusing Trump of ties with Russia) to the press and a number of other people in Washington, including the""midwife of Maidan""herself, Victoria Nuland  Among the McCain Institute s other donors are George Soros and his Open Society Foundations, as well as Saudi Arabia though Volker had to disavow them last year, calling it a one-time donation and saying he won taccept any more Saudi cashafter the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi  All of this adds up to the question no one seems to have asked yet: Whose interests in Ukraine is Kurt Volker actually representing those of the Trump administration, or those of his donors and the ghost of John McCain?

"29 Mar, 2019",Left opt for election scaremongering? Report claims US dark money meddling in Europe,"A new alarming report claims American Christian conservative groups funneled millions to fund shocking meddling in European politics  Seems like a big scoop, or just a ploy to sway European Parliament elections? Thereportreleased by the UK-based political website openDemocracy this week spares no black paint to produce a picture of gross interference in European affairs  The perpetrators are conservative Christian charities, which, the records show, pumped at least $50 million into European countries  All the right names that can scare a left-leaning reader are duly mentioned  Donald Trump? Check  Vladimir Putin? Check  Steve Bannon? Check, three times  Also listed are billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the DeVos family, including Blackwater founder Erik Prince, and the evangelical preacher Franklin  Graham who notably travelled to Russia earlier this month, the report stressed for some arcane reason  #Collusion? I m in Russia right now Moscow to be exact and I m meeting with the Russian churches on how we can share with more young people about faith in Jesus Christ! That s not collusion, but it is collaboration for the sake of souls  #GoodNews A post shared byFranklin Graham(@franklin_graham) onMar 3, 2019 at 9:10am PST Of course the US public records over the past decade, which openDemocracy used as the source for the figure, don t identify the recipients  But the readers may well assume that they had the most nefarious goals in mind  The scale of this meddling by US extremists is shocking, but sadly no surprise to us  Every day European societies face concerted attacks by outside forces seeking to impose reproductive coercion, commented Caroline Hickson, regional director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation s European Network  This is utterly at odds with the European values of democracy and human rights  The authors make no secret that they compiled their work ahead of the European Parliament elections, which will be held throughout EU member states in late May  Right-wing and Eurosceptic parties are widely expected to score big wins at the ballot  Some 40 incumbent MEPs penned a letter calling for action to investigate US Christian fundamentalists and their influence on Europe  Staggering research from ¦@openDemocracy © on just how vulnerable our politics are to well funded organised malign influences  Proud to have organised a cross party MEP call for action httPS: //t co/Lol9yQRgqJ The report seems to be an exercise in scaremongering, painting private donations made by a conservative foundation as something untoward, John Laughland, British conservative author and historian, told RT  Some of the organizations that they mention I personally know  This is just ridiculous  There are MEPs and European political parties that receive money from American sources, including liberals, he said  The notion of dark money being used to interfere in European affairs has been around in some political circles for quite some time  The only difference with this report is that the parties accused of interfering are private charities rather than a foreign nation like Russia, the most popular target for such accusations in the past few years  Perceiving dark money behind political opponents is a kind of conspiratorial thinking that some people in the left-wing camp demonstrate, Laughland added  They think that any kind of movement or current of ideas that is not their current of ideas is either because people are stupid or because they are paid, he said  The complaints about Russian election interference made by the EU and the US, which have a long record of their own meddling in foreign nations, looks like a vivid example of pot calling kettle black, he said  The left complaining about the right receiving foreign money while receiving foreign money themselves would look similarly hypocritical  British Journalist Neil Clark, pointed out that while $50 million may seem like a large sum of money even spent over ten years, it dwarfs compared to the billions and billions floating around in European politics  A significant portion of that money goes to liberal causes funded by wealthy sponsors like Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, the best-known person of that ilk  The impact that his Open Society Foundations made on Europe, especially in the eastern part during post-Soviet transition, is undeniable  Incidentally, the foundation is one of the primary sponsors of openDemocracy itself, alongside US-based groups like National Endowment for Democracy, and the Ford Foundation  Clark warned against piling up a dozen Christian conservative groups into one vaguely neo-Nazi-shaped boogeyman, which is what the report seems to have done  More so, if the goal was to turn it into a campaigning point for the May elections  The issue that the left should be fighting on is economic  Employment, rising poverty in Europe, austerity these are the issues they should be focusing on, and not culture wars, he told RT  And this report to me seems as if it wants to encourage culture wars Basically, Steve Bannon versus George Soros  If left parties do go down that path, it may backfire, Clark said  There are plenty of Christians living in Europe, who vote left  Starting a war with American Christian conservatives would not win votes in Europe  If you ",https://www.rt.com/news/455082-us-dark-money-europe/
"27 Mar, 2019",America s cult of liberal privilege lets Jussie Smollett dodge felony bullet,"Instead of facing charges for staging a hate crime, Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett is free without so much as a slap on the wrist  Welcome to the world of liberal privilege, where criminals enjoy full immunity before the law  Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge As March madness continues to get madder by the day, it is becoming clear that the United States is not just a country being torn apart by two irreconcilably different ideologies, liberalism and conservatism  It is a country where its inhabitants increasingly reside inside of fenced-off, heavily guarded parallel realities  Whereas the one half is governed by the rule of law and tradition, the other half is guided by raw emotion and hysterical claims of victimhood  The case of Jussie Smollett should make it clear which of those realities is gaining the upper hand  Just days after Robert Mueller wrapped up his years-long investigation of Donald Trump, which exonerated the president of any collusion with Russia, Jussie Smollett also received his share of good news  But that is where the similarities between the two public figures come to a screeching halt  Whereas Trump had received non-stop, politically fueled abuse from the media since the moment Mueller started his 675-day inquisition, Smollett got kid-glove treatment from the very same media, despite the extremely disturbing nature of his charges  For the uninitiated, Smollett wasarrestedfor filing a false police report a Class 4 felony with regards to an attack on his person  The Empire star said he was the victim of an assault in Chicago in January, in which two white men allegedly beat him, doused him with bleach, and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene  In addition to hurling racist and homophobic slurs, the men according to Smollett yelled Make America Great Again comments in the course of the attack  That sounds more like a cheap rendition of the 1988 Hollywood film Mississippi Burning than your average winter in Illinois  The takeaway point here is that Mr Smollett orchestrated an actual hate crime based on a volatile cocktail that mixed up race and politics  By appealing to the brutal savagery of America s pre-civil-rights past, complete with allusions to public lynchings, Smollett was attempting to connect Trump supporters to those historic acts of severe racism  That is about as sick and deranged as it gets  Worse, however, is that this rash and reckless stunt relied upon a reverse form of racism after all, it is not just whites who are always guilty of racism that worked to aggravate racial tensions that are always smoldering just below the pavement  Can Michael Flynn get some of the Jussie Smollett privilege?A decorated war hero was entrapped by the feds and now faces $5 million in legal fees for a meaningless process crimeMeanwhile Jussie committed 16 felonies and gets off totally cleanThis is a total injustice Another disturbing part of the fake news story was how so manypeople especially in the Democratic establishment willingly rushed to Smollett s defense before any real investigation had commenced  On that point, would any scandal in America be complete without dropping the name of George Soros? And yes, there does seem to be a connection  It has been reported that Soros donated $408,000 in 2016 to a super PAC that supported State Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office prosecuted  and dropped  the Jussie Smollett case, Breitbartreported   It has even beensuggested, following the release of emails, that Foxx agreed to intervene in the Smollett case on behalf of his family   @JussieSmollettis one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know  I m praying for his quick recovery  This was an attempted modern day lynching  No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin  We must confront this hate  But let s forget about the billionaire interloper for now  The purpose here is to consider the question of justice when it comes to such incidences  The conservatives like to argue that those who inhabit the left side of the political tracks always seem to have a get out of jail free card at the crucial moment, while those on the political right must suffer the full brunt of the media industrial complex  A good example of this mediabiasoccurred in January when a group of students from Covington Catholic High School traveled to Washington DC to partake in a protest  During their trip, words were exchanged between them and members of an obscure religious group  At this point, Nathan Phillips, a Native American, walked between the two groups in an apparent effort to defuse the tensions  He approached Covington student, Nick Sandmann, as he continued to beat on a ceremonial drum  What happened next is already well known  Phillips and Sandmann, aggressively sporting a red MAGA cap, engaged in what appeared to be a cold stare-down between the two  The media, without doing much research into the matter, jumped to the conclusion that Sandmann and his fellow students were taunting the Indian elder, when, as it later transpired through a video, nothing of the sort had happened  Now the Washington Post isfacinga $250 million lawsuit for its mishandling of the story  Was Sandmann s grave offense in the eyes of the media being white, Catholic and a Trump supporter? Meanwhile, Smollett s total exoneration should really not come as a surprise  The trend up until this time points to the fact that liberals have acquired a super sort of immunity when it comes to their behavior, even criminal behavior  The climate of political correctness seems to have given liberals a body armor that repels any accusations made against them  In what other period, for example, could a celebrity hold aloft a severed head effigy of the American president for a promotional photo shoot, as the so-called comedianKathy Griffindid, and not suffer any legal consequences? In fact, Griffincontinuesto play the victim card since pulling the stunt  Then there was the moment when pop queen Madonnatolda crowd of rapturous fans that she has thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House  However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel  Although Jussie Smollett is a free man today, avoiding a lengthy prison term that would have been a certain fate for anyone else, there are signs of anger with the decision, even inside of the Democratic camp  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, for example, called the ruling, a whitewash of justice  At the same time, the Chicago Police Union, which invested a lot of manpower and money into solving the non-crime, iscallingfor a federal investigation of the incident  While the liberals seem to enjoy a sort of invincibility when it comes to some of their more bizarre antics, with no small help from a left-leaning media that supports their every stupid stunt, the tide may be slowly turning against them  In that sense, the liberals may possibly be saved from themselves  @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/454911-liberal-privilege-jussie-smollett/
"27 Mar, 2019",Washington told Ukraine to end probe into George Soros-funded group during 2016 US election report,"An NGO co-funded by George Soros was spared prosecution in 2016 after the US urged Ukraine to drop a corruption probe targeting the group, the Hill reported, pointing to potential shenanigans during the US presidential election  Bankrolled by the Obama administration and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC) was under investigation as part of a larger probe by Ukraine s Prosecutor General s Office into the misallocation of $4 4 million in US funds to fight corruption in the eastern European country  As the 2016 presidential race heated up back in the United States, the US Embassy in Kiev gave Ukraine s Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko a list of people whom we should not prosecute as part of the probe, the Hillreported  Ultimately, no action was taken against AntAC  Lutsenko told the paper that he believes the embassy wanted the probe nixed because it could have exposed the Democrats to a potential scandal during the 2016 election  A State Department official who spoke with the Hill said that while the request to nix the probe was unusual, Washington feared that AntAC was being targeted as retribution for the group s advocacy for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine  AntAC wasn t just the benefactor of well-connected patrons at the time it was also collaborating with FBI agents to uncover then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort s business dealings in Ukraine  Manafort later became a high-profile target of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s probe into alleged Russian collusion, and was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for tax fraud and other financial crimes  Lutsenko divulged in an interview with the Hill last week that he has opened an investigation into whether Ukrainian officials leaked financial records during the 2016 US presidential campaign in an effort to sway the election in favor of Hillary Clinton  While AntAC may have failed to help the FBI find the Russia collusion smoking gun, the group s activities constitute yet another link between the anti-climactic Russiagate probe and Soros, a Democrat mega-donor who bet big on Hillary Clinton taking the White House in 2016  In 2017, the billionaire philanthropist siphoned money into a new group, the Democracy Integrity Project, which later partnered with Fusion GPS to create the now-infamous Steele dossier  Spokespersons for AntAC and the Soros umbrella group Open Society Foundations declined to comment on the Hill s scoop  Ironically, the prosecutor general who had preceded Lutsenko, Viktor Shokin, resigned under pressure from Washington which accused Shokin of corruption  Virtuous US officials continue to make similar demands of Ukraine s justice system  Earlier this month, Washington urged the Ukrainian government to fire its special anti-corruption prosecutor, again over accusations of administrative abuse  ",https://www.rt.com/news/454891-soros-ukraine-ngo-corruption/
"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary s FM: We didn t get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People s Party, the center-right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban  Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto  Follow@SophieCo_RT PodcasthttPS: //soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show  Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation  SS: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news  So, the bloc of the centre-right parties in the European Parliament, the European People's Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz  Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? PS: Look, because    Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the European Union as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that's why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs  And our position is a very strong anti-migration position, which is not shared by many  And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements  So that's why this is the core of the conflict  SS: That's where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre-right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you're saying it's much larger of a spectrum, not just centre-right, because we get an impression that it's a center-right bloc  Ok, so that makes sense  PS: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament  And if you, let's say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you  And we have to be honest, European People's Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be  SS: So, this suspension happened, took place  The head of your Prime Minister's office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP  What s going on right now? PS: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People's Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high-ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let's put it this way  And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP  SS: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn't take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote    PS: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself  SS: So that means, that if it wasn't voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? PS: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow SS: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend PS: Yeah  We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary  So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing  SS: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? PS: No-no-no  We shouldn't confuse the party issue with, let's say, institutional questions  The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so-called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so-called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the European Union, like a cash machine, you know, and don't take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult  Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country  So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies  So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair  SS: So you're saying the payouts are not under threat? PS: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well  So it's a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long-lasting debate or legal procedure  SS: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti-migrant policy that your country's leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we've all seen  Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? PS: No, no definitely not  Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that's going to be the case in the future as well  And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him  A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don't want that to happen  So it's a debate with him, an open debate  He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him  And my question is, why shouldn't a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary  SS: Okay, so let's see how the forces could be re-arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values  That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro-EU, and now it's kind of siding with Italy against  Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right-wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? PS: Look, I don't think it's fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti-European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry  Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the European Union SS: Integration, let s put it this way  PS: Yeah, yeah, right  There's a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward  And there are definitely at least two different camps  One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels  We think it's a dead-end street  We think this is a bad concept  We think that this will not strengthen European Union  What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong  So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro-European position, as we think that the way towards a strong European Union leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage  We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong  So the debate is rather about that, and that's why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong European Union, but we think that SS: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it's not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you're all part of European Union, you want to be part of European Union, but, like you said, there's definitely two camps  One is super pro-integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro-stronger state and a formal Brussels, let's put it this way  So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you've suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? PS: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there  We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we'll see how we go forward  But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti-immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro-migration body  And this is something that we don't like  SS: So you're leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news  You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU's border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation  This is a serious accusation    PS: These are facts, basically  SS: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? PS: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border  Let's look at the Internet, at what they have said  You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting  And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection  Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned  Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it's not a border protection unit  They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together  But protecting the entire border to the South of the European Union with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn't know what he or she speaks about  We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long  So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex  The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders  Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours  So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended  SS: Ok, so I'm going to play a little bit of devil's advocate, and I'm going to tell you what the opposite side is saying  The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they're saying it's ludicrous, and it's a conspiracy theory, and they're actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay  Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you're not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it's under threat? I just want to hear that  PS: Whether the borders are under threat? SS: Do you feel like you're not in control of your own border? PS: We are in control  That's why we have built the fence  That's why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there  But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis  A number of them  So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border  But, you know, it's really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together  We think it's a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together  No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states  SS: So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered    PS: Absolutely  SS: That's your country as well    PS: But this cannot be our country  It's physically excluded  SS: OK  But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary  PS: But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece  So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary - either Greece or Greece and Croatia  Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, - but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, - was that we registered them, and the Greek didn't  But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one  SS: Another thing - Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal  Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? PS: Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament  Then we don't know the composition of that  We don't know the composition of the European Commission  So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens  Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the European Union, what we see is a huge set of double standards  Why? Take the example of Poland  The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system  Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made  They completed all of them from A to Z  And what European Commission has done was saying oh, it's not enough, we continue the procedure  instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer  So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations  SS: So I want to talk a little about Hungary's stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that's something that your country speaks very strongly about  For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro-immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the European Union  If that happens, if the pro-immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? PS: No, absolutely not  That's not in question  SS: So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe's population was Muslim  And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim  I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far-fetched, no?    He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different  PS: Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti-anything  So we are not anti-Muslim  We are not anti-anything  We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe  And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent  You know, it's unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn't be the case  Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo-Christian heritage, with its Christian culture  And in this regard, I think it's very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours  Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II  I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate  SS: I know you don't like Frontex, but I'm still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years  What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? PS: You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the European Union, mostly in the Southern and Southern-Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move - thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe  I was in Jordan recently  The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom  Lebanon - the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there  The last time the Turkish President has complained about the European Union not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU-Turkey deal on migration  As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious  The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck  On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow  Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats - they'll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr  Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships  So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing  I mean, on the level of European Union, we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing  So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the European Union is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe  SS: Okay, I get your point  Now to a different topic - the Russian-led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters  Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans  What's the calculus behind it? What's the logic? PS: Look, now the situation started to change  So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them  We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute  IIB s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter  Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing  There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days  So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary  Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be  You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension  So new and modern investments are happening in the country  We are looking for financial background  So IIB's involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us  SS: But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank  It's a normal, usual practice with this international institutions  But the Western commentators are saying that actually it's a great base for Russia's intelligence services to operate from  What do you say to that? PS: You know, I think I surprised these commentators, including the Hungarian opposition, when I ask them whether they know that five out of the nine owners of this bank are NATO member states  Period  SS: Thank you very much  It's been great pleasure talking to you  Good luck with everything  PS: Thank you for the invitation again  Good being here ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/454459-hungarian-fm-peter-szijjarto/
"24 Feb, 2019",Moscow refutes fantasy report on secret talks between Salvini & Russian deputy PM,"Russia s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak has never met Italy s Matteo Salvini in person, his spokesman said, denying a report on an alleged shady deal the two struck to fund Salvini s Lega Party with Russian money  Kozak has never held any talks with Salvini, a spokesman of the Russian deputy government head, Ilya Dzhus, told journalists on Sunday  He  referred  to an investigative piece publishedby Italy s L'Espresso weekly earlier this week, in which it claimed the Italian deputy prime minister secretly met his Russian colleague in Moscow to discuss the terms of a deal that would supposedly allow his right-wing Lega Party get a hefty sum of money from Russia ahead of the European elections  The so-called investigation by the Italian L'Espresso is based on some flimsy fantasies that do no credit to the media outlet, Dzhus told journalists  Kozak never had any personal contacts to Salvini, never held any official or 'secret' meetings with him, he said  Kozak s agenda does involve bilateral economic cooperation with Italy, including that in the fields of energy and industry  The controversial piece claims that Russia presumably sought to support Italy s Eurosceptic Lega Party at the European parliamentary elections by giving it ¬3 million worth of money disguised as part of a deal between Russia s oil giant Rosneft and Italy s state-owned energy company Eni  Kiev summons Italy envoy after Salvini called Euromaidan a 'pseudo-revolution' sponsored from abroadhttPS: //t co/OkY7aH3jpK The article by the popular Italian magazine mentions nothing about the original sources of its information, but instead says that the whole story is part of a forthcoming book written by a couple of its journalists, which seems to be targeting Lega  It also scarcely mentions Salvini and Kozak, but instead says that the deal was largely orchestrated by the Italian deputy prime minister s former spokesman, Gianluca Savoini, who conveniently turns out to be thepresidentof the Lombardy-Russia cultural association  The photos that Giovanni Tizian and Stefano Vergine the authors of the hit-piece showed as the supposed proof of their claims also do not demonstrate anything particularly incriminating    They  picture the aftermath of a conference, which Salvini officially attended in Moscow, an outer view of a building where he reportedly met Kozak, and also show Savoini sitting at a table at Moscow s Metropol Hotel s restaurant allegedly ahead of the secret talks, as the journalists  spin it  Despite lack of any solid proof, the story quickly got  reprinted  by some media, such as theGuardianand theDaily Beast  The Italian journalists behind the investigation admitted that they do not really know if the deal was struck at all as they presumably finished their investigation before the end of the negotiations  Despite that the  Daily Beast  quoted them as saying: The main Italian government force is supported by [the Russian President Vladimir ] Putin, the number one enemy of the EU  While the Italian opposition lawmakers rushed to describe L'Espresso s claims as worrying, Salvini s office brushed off any such allegations outright by saying that they are not commenting on fantasies  Russia s Rosneft, which was also mentioned in the hit-piece previously published by Italy s La Stampa as well, demanded the journalists retract their claims  All the information about Rosneft in this article is incorrect and is a lie aimed at damaging the business reputation of the company, it said in a statement  It is not the first attempt to accuse Salvini of colluding with the Kremlin  Last year, the Italian deputy prime minister vehemently rejected similar accusationsmadeby controversial billionaire George Soros  An outspoken Italian politician, who repeatedly criticized anti-Russian sanctions andsupportedrecognizing Crimea s reunification with Russia, said at that time that he never received any lira, euro or ruble from Russia  If you ",https://www.rt.com/news/452322-salvini-russia-lega-funding-report/
"19 Feb, 2019",NATO s Atlantic Council hijacks Munich conference with revisionist principles declaration,"Taking over the annual Munich security conference, the Atlantic Council has come out with a declaration of principles that seeks to legitimize the rogue behavior of the West after the Cold War as a rules-based world order  For almost three decades now, Washington and its numerous clients and allies have insisted they were only upholding a rules-based international order against those who seek to challenge it, be it rogue states such as North Korea and Iran or great powers such as Russia and China  In the process, this self-styled international community trampled actual rules and laws to sanction, bomb, invade, occupy and regime-change countries that stood in its way while claiming to be acting in the interests of the peace, democracy and commerce  Back in 2007, Russian President VladimirPutin stood upat the Munich Security Conference in Germany and denounced this behavior, arguing that the US has overstepped its national borders in every way, imposing economic, political, cultural and educational policies on other nations while holding itself exempt from any rules and limitations  This past weekend, the Atlantic Council a think-tank backed by the US, NATO and other allied governments used the platform of the Munich conference to announce a declaration of principles that explicitly seeks to revise the international order along the very lines Putin criticized, essentially establishing its signatories as the judge, jury and executioner of international law as they write it  ð¨BREAKING NEWS: Former leading officials from democratic countries have come together to declare their intent to defend a rules-based order  Here is the full set of principles #DefendDemocracy#ACDeclaration#MSC2019Read:httPS: //t co/JOy6l14nSnpic twitter com/GjFcp4nhcP In the words ofJohn Bellinger, one of the declaration s authors, it was loosely modeled on the Atlantic Charter, the WWII-era document establishing the US-UK alliance  Yet the new document has far more in common with the goals of Germany, Italy and Japan in that it is explicitly revisionist, saying: We will seek to revise and strengthen the international system to reflect these principles and advance them on the basis of international law  Those undersigned are endorsing a standing mechanism that would track compliance with the principles outlined in the declaration and urge our governments to act when these principles are violated  Wasn t that supposed to be the job of the United Nations? And how is it respectful of others freedom and sovereignty to impose values on them at gunpoint? The declaration creates more questions than it purports to answer  The seven-point platform pays lip service to freedom and justice, democracy and self-determination, peace and security, free markets and equal opportunity  It also demands of signatories to support an open global economy  Point Four somehow managed to advocate for private property and capitalism as well as welfare state and open borders, asserting the right to own property, purchase goods and services, and invest in free and open markets as well as free and fair flow of trade and investment but also demanding of governments to facilitate access to food, water, shelter, medical services, and educationfor their own citizens and others in need (emphasis added)  Point Five also talks about an open and healthy planet in vague terms that combine overarching global environmentalism and migration across only nominally controlled borders  The true gem is Point Six, the right of assistance that would require governments to allow their citizens to receive assistance from others to advance these principles, including, in non-free societies, support to non-violent groups, political parties, and individuals aiming to foster democracy or human rights but also the signatories to intervene where governments or other actors are unwilling or unable to cease or remedy flagrant or systematic violations  Who would define non-free societies ? Why of course, the signatories of the Atlantic Council declaration! The commitment to peace and security in Point Three asks the signatories to refrain from the use of force,except as just and necessary to advance these principles  (emphasis added) The devil is in the details, as they say in this case, in that qualifying clause  There is a massive amount of hypocrisy in the US and its allies advocating for free markets and open flow of goods and services, while being the world s leading source of sanctions, blacklists and blockades against those who resist their demands  Likewise, the notion of initiating force in order to promote the values of this declaration is a total mockery of values advocated by the champions of modern democracy though it might be easily recognizable to ancient Athenians, who demanded the surrender of Melos with the argument that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must  Perhaps the most pernicious notion in the declaration, however, is that it expands the duty to uphold its values from governments to ""private entities and individuals where they are able  It is not hard to see how this is a direct attempt to lend legitimacy to the legion of quasi-NGOs backed by Western governments and their philanthropist hitmen like George Soros  There is only one tiny little problem with this: it upends the entire international order based on the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which gave governments the monopoly on force within their territory  The preceding Thirty Years War had seen much of Europe devastated by a conflict that started as a dynastic dispute only to spiral into a religious war characterized by widespread massacres and atrocities committed by official militaries as much as militias and mercenaries  ð¨ We will defend our values, overcome past failures with new ideas, answer lies with truth, confront aggression with strength, and go forward with the confidence that our principles will prevail  Join us #DefendDemocracyRead#ACDeclarationhere:httPS: //t co/JOy6l14nSnpic twitter com/GGFmbvCa6e Looking at the committee that drafted this declaration, it becomes clear why it seeks to legitimize the lawlessness of the post-Cold War behavior by the bombers of Yugoslavia, invaders of Iraq, and regime-changers of Libya  Among the co-chairs of the drafting commission are former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former George W  Bush national security advisor Stephen Hadley, uniting the neoliberals and neoconservatives around the idea of a US-led global hegemony  The list of former government officials who signed the declaration also reads as a who s who of US empire boosters, from former NATO GenSec Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Denmark) to former foreign ministers Tzipi Livni (Israel), Radek Sikorski (Poland), and David Miliband and Malcolm Rifkind Labour and Tory, respectively of the UK  Other notable names include Munich Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger, former deputy FM of Germany, as well as former Australian FM Alexander Downer, best known for his 2016 role in claiming Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was somehow connected to the phantom Trump-Russia collusion  The world could do worse than to take their declarations with a large chunk of salt  Nebojsa Malic, RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/451783-atlantic-council-declaration-revisionist/
"13 Feb, 2019",Revolution is the new black: How Western money funds overthrow-your-government classes,"Everyone at this gathering in Yerevan is young, hip and determined, and they re learning how to stage a revolution  RT Russian managed to get inside the protesters camp, funded by US cash, and see what is being taught  The CampÐ¡amp 2018 forum in Yerevan was sponsored by the Prague Civil Society Centre, an organization financed by the United States under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)  Section 254 of the Act allocated $250,000 for activities to counter Russian influence in 2018 and 2019  Capitol Hill lawmakers seem to believe that this Russian influence is a threat to all NATO s actual and potential members, including Georgia, Moldova, Kosovo, Serbia, and Ukraine  The Yerevan gathering is proving that the State Department s money is doing its job all right  Protest-lobbying spin doctors have been putting the money to good use dragging more and more people into their skillfully woven web  And it s no coincidence Armenia was chosen to host the camp  After large-scale protests forced Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan to resign, protesters from all over the Commonwealth of Independent States started flocking to Yerevan for more inspiration  A total of 150 people participated in the forum; most were sponsored by the organizers from Prague  Local participants were hailed as heroes, and visiting young men and women from other ex-Soviet republics got their own injection of inspiration from their triumph  If Armenia could, they can, too  The focus in CampCamp is on new technologies, on all things young and hip  Fighting the authorities must be the cool thing to do, it must be trendy, teaches Nikolay Artyomenko, head of the opposition Vremya (Time) movement from St  Petersburg  His portfolio is quite impressive  He put up banners on St  Isaac s Cathedral protesting against the Orthodox Church taking over the museum  He ran a copy of the country s constitution through a shredder, Banksy style, co-organized anti-corruption protests with rubber ducks; distributed Dictator prints where Putin was depicted like Obama in his Hope posters  Nikolay teaches others to be creative and invent new ways to protest that should take over the old-school crowd with picket signs format  You have to stretch your imagination; there s quite a problem on the protesting market these days  Protesting has become very expensive ,he shares  But Zhenya, an activist from Siberia, knows how to cut costs  He just turned 18, yet he has already risen to stardom on the activist scene: his one-man protests have made front-page headlines in his city more than once  Each of Zhenya s demonstrations is like a theatrical performance  He carefully selects props and plans according to the country s Administrative Penal Code: You have to make sure you violate different laws to avoid being double-fined  He s locked in a long debate with Sasha from St  Petersburg about what kind of a public protest will get the smallest fine, and how to cut the expenses   Sasha is the more experienced of the two: he is already a law student and knows how to protest with minimal charges  This is yet another important factor in making protesting popular  Protests should not be seen as something heroic that one pays too high a price for  Just slap a poster on a wall here and there, upload a stinging meme or at most join a protesting crowd, take a selfie in the police van, pay your fine and go home  In today s world of social media, absolutely anyone can be a reporter, an expert, a critic or a TV journalist so why not be a revolutionary? It is easy to get a grant; you can spend a month in the Czech Republic or work at Radio Free Europe or some think tank ,Michael Zolyan tells Polina from Omsk  Michael is the frontman of the Velvet Revolution ,according to the organizers  By coincidence, he is also a Prague Civil Society Centre expert  The CampCamp 2018 s most active group is the one from Kyrgyzstan  It s a crowd of young journalists led by Bektour Iskender, founder of opposition web portal Ðloop kg  Bektour sees no harm that this festival of democracy is sponsored by foreign money  During the break, he confirms that his project is financed by the Prague Civil Society Centre  They treat me as an equal  They don t try to be my boss, and I m good with it ,he says  Bektour s workshop is called How to fight things you hate doing what you like  It looks like he has honed his skills to perfection and is quite happy doing journalism in Kyrgyzstan with US funding  The workshop starts off very much like one of those self-esteem web courses where you have to write a list of things you don t like about yourself; only instead of I m overweight or I m single you write down things that are wrong with your country, like corruption, or totalitarianism, or Putin, or fake news, or no respect for children  Masha, a student from Odessa seems to be unable to figure out what to write under What do you hate most? Instead of corruption she finally settles on sloppy eaters  Step number two: think of a solution to the problem you ve indicated using something you enjoy doing  Zhenya from Siberia and Boris from Dushanbe spend the next 15 minutes thinking of how they can overthrow the government while sky gazing in the trees  Sounds downright comical, but the guys admit freely that they don t mind using falsification and manipulation for the right cause, if necessary  We can spread a rumor that the authorities are going to cut down trees ,they begin  The audience cheers them on  Sure, that s not true, but if we scare enough people, if we make them believe they are about to lose something good, that might help make them more active and start asking the government questions  Artist Dasha Sozanovich goes on to explain in her workshop how to use cool visuals for protest purposes  Pictures work for both good and evil, she says  The Islamic State s (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) visual campaign is an example of how pictures served evil  Dasha s own project called Khabarstan is, on the other hand, an example of how pictures serve the good guys  Her presentation makes Kazakhstan funding state TV channels much more exciting  Dasha points out that it was the Prague Civil Society Centre that united all those who collaborated on this project  ÐÐµÑÐµÐ´Ð´ÐµÐ½Ñ#HalloweenÐ·Ð°Ð¿ÑÑÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸#Ð¥Ð° Ð°ÑÑÑÐ°Ð½ httPS: //t co/hHDeJys8dgno poka da pic twitter com/PNTO5JisMq Dasha s pictures do their best to help the viewers understand that spending state money on media is very wrong  No one mentions though that her time, meals, travel and lodging expenses have been fully covered from the state budget of the United States of America  Two young artists are working away on their whiteboards creating stylish animations of the presentations they see, instead of taking notes the traditional way  That looks very cool, too  I decided to be an activist 11 years ago  It all started at a police station  That s a comic strip, where one of the artists captured the essence of what another star of the Armenian Revolution David Sansaryan was saying  One more piece of advice young activists get here is that they should focus on social media, like Russian social networks OK ru and VK ru, as well as Facebook, since they can t really compete with real media  The main goal is to elicit a response, get people to repost and comment on their publications  It s like something out of this world for us, says a girl from Kazakhstan  There are also young people from Russia and Belarus here, dreaming to repeat Yerevan s success  Vanya from Perm confesses to the supportive audience that he came here to export the revolution  That s exactly what our friends from Prague, Europe s partisans of democracy are going to be teaching them all four days of the forum  However, the excitement he created gets killed by a word of reason from head organizer Maria Sereda  She reminds all those present about security and requests them to refrain from tweeting this catchy slogan, or we ll have Russian cameras all over the place in no time  The forum also offers a handful of workshops on techniques that can be used to increase protest sentiment in society  One workshop uses the theme of Russian folk tales  In one of the cases, a forest community learns to interact with the government, i e  the Big Bad Wolf  Speaking of overthrowing the Big Bad Wolf of Belarus, the head organizer says that there is only one to do it â to let the little critters anger grow over the years  You ll have to let the little critters anger grow till you impeach the Big Bad Wolf, Maria Sereda says cheerfully  This case will work great for Belarus  And it has already worked for Ukraine!

"8 Jan, 2019","In Western media, publishing fake news about Russia is a good career move with no consequences","Fighting ""Russian disinformation"" in the West has become a lucrative business  But, in reality, you're far more likely to encounter deceitful agitprop directed at Russia  Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv MOSCOW CP Scott remains a towering figure in the annals of British journalism  Editor of the then ""Manchester Guardian"" for an astonishing 57 years, he celebrated his paper's centenary by laying down a set of legendary principles  ""Comment is free, but facts are sacred,"" Scott intoned in the missive  Sadly, almost a hundred years later, facts are free and the right to spread disinformation is becoming sacred, as far as his successors are concerned  Particularly when it comes to coverage of Russia  Yet another example came over the New Year break  Following a few weeks out of the spotlight after peddling an obviously fake story about Julian Assange/Paul Manafort meetings in London, Luke Harding reappeared  And he came armed with his particular brand of bulls*** and sloppiness  A sensationalistinterviewwith former Soviet spy 'Viktor Suvorov' was full of fragile fact-checking and downright stupidity  For instance, presenting a pensioner, who defected from a different country almost 40 years ago, as an authority on how Vladimir Putin's Kremlin operates today stretched credulity  And the piece was also riddled with factual errors, to boot  For instance, Harding claimed Suvorov's 1980's book ""Icebreaker"" now ""has broad acceptance among historians;"" a tome which insists ""Stalin had been secretly plotting an offensive against Hitler's Germany"" but first he ""wanted Hitler to destroy democracy in Europe, in the manner of an icebreaker, thereby clearing the way for world communism "" In other words, not the version you learned at school  Except, surprise, surprise, this statement on Suvorov's book isn't true  As  one scholarpointed out, while demanding a correction from Harding, it's more accurate to say the opposite is the case  Indeed,  the scholarreferenced, ""Suvorov's argument was rapidly countered by much of the established Russian historical community,"" including Dmitry Volkogonov, ""with the support of Western historians "" We've been here before with Harding  He's repeatedly weaved fantastical stories about Russia, and other subjects, for years  But, as the legendary ex-Moscow hack Mark Amesobserves""literally nothing Harding publishes, no matter how demonstrably false and reckless, will ever hurt his journalism career  He's a Made Man "" Guardian hack Luke Harding was caught plagiarizing me,@yashalevine& others and it had zero effect on his career advancement  If his latest scoop on Manafort/Assange is debunked, there will be zero consequences  Most of us still can t fully grasp thishttPS: //t co/8AeD8GRXh0 And, while he's an especially blatant example, Harding is not alone in this  Because on the Russia beat, it seems Western journalists can pretty much get away with any transgressions, without suffering career damage  Instead, paradoxically, it often seems to even lead to professional progression  Today, you hear a lot of hysteria concerning ""Russian disinformation"" in the West, but little or nothing, in mainstream media, on ""disinformation about Russia,"" something this writer has tried to cover in recent years  And it's a lonely beat  Indeed, as the Canadian academic Paul Robinson rightly notes, while ""there's a huge army of well-funded institutions and individuals now devoted to uncovering and countering 'Russian disinformation,' there seems to be little or no accountability for the false stories produced by Western sources (on Russia) "" And the examples are legion  With even the most heinous fakes failing to amount to any sort of setback for their promoters  Which suggests editors are more than happy to indulge the practice, because after all it's only Russia and everyone knows Russia is ""bad "" Here are a few selected lowlights Numerous other examples exist but more are hardly needed to show how there seems to be no penalty for getting Russia wrong in Western media  And, on the contrary, it's hardly a conspiracy theory to suggest it's actively encouraged  Which means, of course, disinformation about Russia is far more common, organized and influential than notional ""Russian disinformation "" Particularly on social networks, but prevalent too in supposedly ""respectable"" media  READ MORE: The only Russian bots to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat-linked experts Nevertheless, don't hold your breath waiting for the usual think tank

Well, in a New York Times op-ed published Friday, columnist Michelle Goldberg called for Facebook a ruthless monopoly that should be forcibly broken up with antitrust legislation as happened to America s robber baron industrialists in the early 20th Century  Significantly, calls for antitrust action against Facebook have, until now, come from Republicans  President Trump himself reportedly weighed antitrust action against tech monopolies in September, warning Google and Facebook that they were treading on very, very troubled territory  Since 2016, Zuckerberg has shared one unbreakable bond with American liberals: a willingness to blame Russia  To that end, Facebook announced plans to use artificial intelligence to weed out content it deems harmful to election security;partneredup with an aggressively anti-Russia think tank to fight dangerous narratives; and went as far asbuildinga physical war room to combat foreign interference in real time during this month s midterm elections  But its report, or rather blogposton Russian interference was criticized for revealing little  In it, Facebook said that Russian agents had spent a paltry $100,000 on political ads, the majority of which didn t specifically reference the US presidential election, voting or a particular candidate  The ads, Facebook concluded, were ineffective, completely legal, and relatively inconsequential  The New York Times alleges that Facebook didn t go far enough in its anti-Russia activities  Citing one of its ownreportsas an example, the Times argued that Facebook s blog post barely scratched the surface of the Russian conspiracy  Losing support from the right and the left, Zuckerberg looks set to face down the incoming PR nightmare with fewer friends than before  With Soros reportedlycallingon Facebook to undertake an audit of its own lobbying and PR work, the stage is once again set for another public examination of the world s largest social network  And with Facebook investors alreadyunhappywith Zuckerberg s leadership, the 34-year-old CEO could stand to make a dramatic fall  Graham Dockery All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/usa/444209-facebook-fake-news-scandal/

"9 Nov, 2018",Dirty little secret: Think tanks are among top culprits in media disinformation crisis,"Most consumers are unaware off the mainstream media s dirty little secret  Think tanks are increasingly taking advantage of tight news budgets to influence the press agenda in favour of their sponsors  Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Decades ago, these outfits generally operated as policy advisories  Although, some were comfortably enumerated retirement homes for distinguished public servants or intellectuals  However, in modern times, they have become indistinguishable from lobbying firms  With the budgets to match  On the Russia (and broader Eastern European) beat, think tank influence is becoming increasingly dangerous and malign  And it s leading to a crisis in journalistic standards which nobody wants to acknowledge  Two cases this week highlight the malaise  Right now, Hungary and Ukraine are embroiled in a standoff regarding the rights of ethnic Hungarians in the latter country  The disagreement is entirely local, with roots in the 20th century carving-up of Budapest s territory after it found itself on the losing side in both World Wars  As a result, lands were dispersed into other nations former Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union  There are tensions, to varying degrees, between Hungary and pretty much all the successor states housing its lost diaspora  Especially since nationalist Viktor Orban started handing out passports to compatriots stranded on foreign soil  Until recently, most of the focus was on disagreements with Slovakia, but now attention has switched to Ukraine  Let s be clear  This is a mess of Kiev s making  In a bid to appease patriotic fundamentalists, it began moves towards restrictive language laws, which has especially alienated the small band of Hungarian speakers on its western frontier  Predictably, Budapest rushed in to defend its people, and now we have a nasty little imbroglio with headbangers on both sides entrenched  One thing it s not about is Russia  But Western media, egged on by think tank experts, keeps banging this drum  And here is a case in point this week  The Los AngelesTimessent a correspondent to Uzhgorod, a Ukrainian border city  And rather than merely report from the ground, the writer spends a huge amount of the article referring to Russia and intimating that Orban is operating in lock-step with Moscow  Which is laughable to anybody who understands the Hungarian PM s political methods  And which reeks of disinformation  And who is used to back up these assertions? Only one Peter Kreko, director of the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank, who is concerned Orban s moves help Russia hamper Ukraine s Euro-Atlantic integration  Now, isn t that a weird sort of thing for a Hungarian analyst to be worrying about? Well, it wouldn t be if the LA Times were transparent and disclosed Kreko s funding  You see, here s who bankrolls the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank  Institute of Modern Russia (plaything of disgraced former 90 s oligarch and Putin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky) National Endowment For Democracy (a US neoconservative outlet dedicated to regime change and promoting a pro-US outlook in Eastern Europe, whose chair has dubbed Ukraine the big prize ) Open Society (George Soros, who needs no introduction) And here are some of the most important international and domestic professional partners of the Political Capital Institute: Atlantic Council (NATO s propaganda wing) European Values (a Soros-funded Prague lobby group which smeared hundreds of European public figures as useful idiots for appearing on RT  Including Jeremy Corbyn and Stephen Fry)  German Marshall Fund of the United States (proprietors of the infamous Hamilton 68 dashboard) Thus, the agendas at play are pretty clear here  Yet, the LA Times keeps its readers ignorant of Kreko s paymasters  Which is especially interesting when you see RT, almost always, referred to as the Kremlin-funded Russia Today, or some version thereof, when described in Western media  And this is fine, because it s true, but when the same rules don t apply across the board, the bias is obvious  The second case comes courtesy of the Rupert Murdoch controlled Times of London (see what I did there?) This week, it alleged around75,000Russians in London alone are Kremlin informants  All based on an investigation by the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a neoconservative pressure group which seems to have successfully mounted a reverse takeover of the once venerable paper  With its leader writer, for instance, being a founding signatory of theconcern  Anyway, HJS, apparently based on a mere 16 interviews, with unnamed sources, concluded that between a quarter and a half of Russian expats were, or have been informants  And the Times splashed it  However, it clarified, with comment from an anonymous dissident, how, in reality, it was about half  So, only the 32,500 odd agents in London then  Which, if true, would means the walls of the Russian Embassy would have to be made from elastic to house the amount of handlers required to keep tabs on their information sources  Look, it s hardly a secret that standards at the Times are low  After all, the main foreign affairs columnist, Edward Lucas, is literally funded by US weaponsmanufacturers  No, this is not a joke  Lucas is employed as a lobbyist at CEPA, a Washington and Warsaw-based outfit, which promotes the arms manufacturer's agenda in Central and Eastern Europe  Namely, thelikesof Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, FireEye, and Bell Helicopters  Of course, The Times doesn t make this conflict of interests clear to its readers  Another example of how the think tank tail is wagging the mainstream media dog these days  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443540-think-tanks-media-disinformation/
"4 Nov, 2018",It s not Russia that s damaging American democracy it s money,"It is estimated that over $5 2 billion will be spent on the US midterm elections and it s no secret that hundreds of millions of those dollars are supplied by billionaire donors  This system is incompatible with real democracy  is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin  Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others  Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin  Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others  Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ In a piece for The Guardian last week, Chuck Collinswrotethat the three wealthiest families in the US  the Waltons of Walmart, the Mars candy family and the Koch brothers  own a combined fortune of $348 7 billion  a sum which is 4 million times the median wealth of a normal American family  Arecent studyconducted by researchers at Northwestern University found that despite the popular narrative of the so-called philanthropic liberal billionaire in the style of Bill Gates, most of these super rich mega-donors are extremely conservative in their political views  They believe in cutting taxes for the rich and abolishing the estate tax  They are opposed to banking and environmental regulation  and they aren t overly enthusiastic about social programs upon which millions of Americans rely  Instead of being loud and proud about these views, however, they practice what the study authors called stealth politics  in other words, they rarely speak publicly on politics, but spend massive amounts of money lobbying politicians on the quiet  This is not to imply that conservative billionaire donors are bad and liberal billionaires donors are good, which is what mainstream liberal media would seemingly like us to believe when they promote the likes of George Soros as a paragon of goodness while lamenting the influence of the Koch brothers  It is, however, a simple fact that America s wealthiest billionaires areoverwhelmingly conservative  and very rarely are they interested in creating a society that is fairer and better serves the average working American  But, regardless of the politics of those doling out the dosh, this is a rotten and corrupt system of legalized bribery and one that is completely incompatible with true democracy  How could it be? Politicians are beholden not to the people, but to wealthy donors and special interests  Don t just take it from me  Former congressman Mick Mulvaney, who is now the White House budget director, wasremarkably candidabout all this during a speech back in April  We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress  If you re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn t talk to you  If you re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you  Rich donors and lobbyists shovel obscene amounts of money into political campaigns knowing that politicians will serve their interests in Congress  Conservative billionaire Sheldon Adelson, for example, has funneled more than $100 million into the 2018 midterms  If you re wondering why people like Adelson, who have billions in hoarded wealth, would even bother with elections the answer is simple: abject greed  As Collins wrote in the Guardian, they are spending millions to save themselves billions down the road  Meanwhile, normal Americans, despite how politically active they may be, have anear-zero impacton public policy  Yet, getting money out of politics and taking back control of their democracy does not seem to be as big a focus as it should be for most Americans  Instead, super-rich elites, aided by the mainstream media, have been massively successful in distracting the population with conveniently constructed narratives  For the Democrats, so-called Russian collusion and interference has acted as a successfuldistraction tacticsince Donald Trump was elected  For Republicans and Trump himself, over-the-top fear-mongering about immigration while ignoring its root causes (often destabilizing US foreign policy) has been a wonderful distraction tactic  READ MORE: #ICYMI: How to spot Russian interference in the US midterm elections (VIDEO) When Americans are talking non-stop about Russians and migrants coming to get them, they re not focused on the fact that the political system in which they are operating is corrupt to the core and serves only a tiny minority of mega-rich citizens who reside in ivory towers  Actress Marsha Warfield summed it up perfectly in a tweet last week: Why the hell are you mad at immigrants seeking a better life and not the tiny percentage of greedy f*cks hoarding the world's resources while we fight amongst ourselves for crumbs? In 2016, about $6 5 billion was spent on presidential and congressional campaigns  That s about enough to give every teacher a$2,000 pay rise  Aside from the many ways such money could clearly be put to better use, there s also the fact that money is a huge barrier to entry for any American trying to get into politics  If you can t raise the money, you can t run a campaign  and if you do manage to raise the money (thanks to wealthy donors), you are beholden to them later  Only very rarely does a candidate manage to build a successful grassroots campaign without accepting big donor and corporate money  Democrats often pay lip-service to the idea of getting money out of politics, but in reality, they re just as happy as Republicans to take money from anyone who wants to throw it at them  More than$1 billionhas been spent by outside groups (independent of and not coordinated with campaigns) to influence the midterm elections  Nearly $128 million has been spent by""dark money""groups which do not disclose who their donors are  And, consider this: Only0 42 percentof Americans have given $200 or more to elections this year  Yet, miniscule as that number is, those peopleaccount formore than 66 percent of all campaign donations  READ MORE: From dumpster fires to deportation buses: The midterms craziest campaign ads This is not democracy in action  Until Americans realize that choosing between corporate Democrats and Republicans is like choosing between a slap in the face or a punch in the nose, nothing will be any different  When the ballots are counted on November 6, whether it s a victory for the Democrats or Republicans, it will still be a tiny minority of elites who hold all the power  Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won t tell you  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443088-money-damaging-us-democracy-midterms/

"4 Oct, 2018",The military-industrial-humanitarian complex: Spreading Western hegemony under the guise of virtue,"Shakespeare once wrote that the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose  Nowadays, we see the terms humanitarian and democracy abused to justify death and destruction  Traditionally honorable words such as humanitarian and democracy have come to acquire a darker and more cynical meaning following their misappropriation to justify the invasion of sovereign nations and to promote the spread of Western military and cultural dominance across the globe  The mainstream media, alongside some human rights activists, assist these ventures by helping disseminate mistruths and by tapping into the emotions of fear, anger and revulsion to soften public opinion and make aggression against a sovereign state appear justified  Running parallel to politicians lies that Saddam Hussein possessed WMD deployable within 45 minutes, a strategy was deployed to shock-and-awe the public into accepting the invasion through attention-grabbing headlines crafted to abhor readers with evidence of Saddam s butchery and to generate strong emotional reactions which would cause people to think with their hearts rather than their heads  One such story written by Labour MP Ann Clwyd and published inThe Timesjust two days before the US-led Coalition of the Willing began destroying Iraq, asserted that Saddam possessed a human-shredding machine into which adversaries were fed feet-first and turned into fish food  The article, titled See men shredded, then say you don t back war, had the double effect of causing the reader to feel revulsion and of making the anti-war lobby appear callous and indifferent to the plight of the Iraqi people  The existence of a human shredder was laterchallengedand such a machine has yet to be found  Saddam s real crimes were known to USintelligenceservices, who informed him about the locations of Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, in the knowledge that he would use mustard gas and sarin against them  The US also provided Saddam withclusterbombs and helped him acquire chemical precursor agents  US-based Human Rights Watch estimated that Saddam killed at least290,000of his own people while in power    However, this figure is dwarfed by the number of Iraqis believed to have died in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, due to occupation forces, sectarian violence or ISIS this figure isestimatedto be in the hundreds of thousands, if not in excess of a million  The psychological shock-and-awe strategy was again employed in the lead up to NATO s bombing of Libya, as the US and UK s on-offrelationshipwith Gaddafi took a turn for the worse after he planned to start selling oil in dinars (a new gold-backed pan-African currency) instead of US dollars or euros, and encouraged his African neighbors to follow suit  The release of Hillary Clinton s emails in late 2015 revealed that such a move would havestrengthenedAfrican economies and led to competition between the dinar and the dollar or euro  On this occasion, we were treated to the excuse that bombing Libya and supporting the anti-Gaddafi rebels, including Al-Qaeda-affiliatedelements, was necessary as Gaddafi was about to commit amassacreagainst the people of the rebel-controlled city of Benghazi  Another emotive claim designed to mould public opinion into accepting the war affirmed that Gaddafi was giving his soldiers Viagra so they could commit mass rape  An investigation by Amnesty International found no evidence to support this allegation and revealed that on several occasions anti-Gaddafi forces in Benghazi hadmadefalse allegations or manufactured evidence of human rights violations  Gaddafi was overthrown and one of the richest and most-stable countries in Africa became a failed and lawless state controlled by a mishmash of rebel groups, some affiliated or sympathetic to Al-Qaeda  These groupsbeganto persecute, imprison and murder Sub-Saharan Africans on a mass scale, many of whom had come to Libya as economic migrants, accusing them of loyalty to Gaddafi  Furthermore, Libya s destruction triggered a war in neighboring Mali and helped strengthen Al-Qaeda and ISIS in North Africa  Some of the anti-Gaddafi rebels would later find their wayto Syria  The same script was used in relation to Syria as Western politicians, along with their media and activist allies, worked hard to drum up public support for removing the country s president from power  In 2013, the emotions of Western audiences were targeted with claims that Assad had used sarin against civilians, meaning his removal from power needed to be acted-on without delay  The allegation remains unproven and a UN-led inquiry later indicated that anti-governmentrebelsthemselves may have been responsible for the attack   The claims that Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people seem to surface whenever the Syrian government regains large amounts of territory from rebel or jihadist forces  President Assad has been blamed for causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in a conflict forced upon Syria where Saudi Arabia and Qatar (among other states) havefunded and armedrebels that Western intelligence agencies consider moderate  WikiLeaks haspublisheddiplomatic cables in which US politicians expressed concern that Saudi Arabian donors were sending money and weapons to groups such as Al-Nusra Front (also known as the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda) and ISIS  Syrian opposition activists claim that as of September 2018 an estimated164,336to522,000people (depending which anti-Assad group you ask) have been killed since the conflict began in 2011  Although the Syrian opposition and their Western and Gulf-state supporters are quick to blame President Assad for these deaths, those killed include Syrian soldiers and pro-government militias who died defending their country from moderate (and not-so-moderate) rebels backed by Syria s enemies, as well as civilians killed by these rebel groups  When Russia came to Syria s aid in September 2015, at the request of the country s government, to assist in the fight against ISIS, Al-Nusra and other rebel groups, it faced criticism from the Western media and Syrian opposition groups who accused Russia of propping up a dictator something of which the UK and US have much experience  Presumably the US and its allies desire to overthrow Assad was worth the risk of ISIS continuing its march of terror and destruction across Syria until its flags flew over Damascus  The barrage of attacks against Russia intensified in 2016 when the nation provided Syrian troops with air support in their campaign to retake Aleppo,formerlythe country s largest city and financial and industrial hub, from a range of rebel groupincludingAl-Nusra Front and a number of non-Syrian jihadist fighters  Newspapers across the political spectrum shed crocodile tears about the number of civilians and babies killed in the Russian bombing, presumably forgetting that the children of Gaza and Yemen are no less immortal when it comes to aerial bombardment  The Western media chooses where to direct its audiences emotions  Thediscreditedorganization known as the White Helmets, which receivesfundingfrom the US and several European governments, injected an additional dose of pathos into the mix, showing what they claimed were pictures and videos of their members pulling children and civilians from the rubble in Aleppo  Thecontroversiessurrounding this group have been well documented  Then we saw another media darling, seven-year-old Syrian girl Bana al-Abed, allegedlytweetingpleas for Western intervention,including Dear world, it s better to start 3rd world war instead of letting Russia & assad commit #HolocaustAleppo, though it s questionable whether she produced such tweets without adult assistance  The US-based Human Rights Watch, which hasreceivedmillions of dollars from billionaire George Soros, cited a report from a Syrian opposition group stating that446civilians were killed by Russian and Syrian planes during the battle for Aleppo in the month of September to October 2016  Elsewhere, Human Rights Watchcitesthe UK-basedpro-oppositionSyrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claims that airstrikes by the US-led coalitionkilled1,064 civilians, including 248 children, during the battle of Raqqa between early June September 20, 2017  Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the populations of Aleppo and Raqqa in 2016 and 2017 respectively, as of 2018 Aleppo s population numbers 1 6 million; while Raqqa s is 61,000  Each civilian death is a tragedy in its own right, regardless of whether it is caused by American, Russian, Syrian or any other nation s aircraft  However, it must be acknowledged that only Russia and Iran intervened in the Syrian conflict at the request of the nation s legitimate government  All other nations involving themselves in the Syrian conflict are in breach of international law and warrant expulsion from Syrian territory  Due to Russia s intervention, Syria will now not go the way of Iraq or Libya and is on the path to again becoming a united and stable nation with a secular and diverse identity  This is one intervention which prevented the destruction of a nation and saved millions from the unimaginable nightmare of life under ISIS or similar groups  This is the opposite of the Western approach, by which a unified nation is plunged into anarchy and the terrorists appear only after the humanitarian intervention has transpired  Like this story?

So far, the evidence suggest that there is indeed plenty for the left to worry about when it comes to corporations like Facebook and Twitter and their alliances with government censors  1  Facebook censorship of Venezuelan news In May, Facebook partnered with the Atlantic Council in an effort to weed out inauthentic content on the platform  This organization isfunded byvarious NATO governments and a slew of arms manufacturers like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman  Its board includes names like Henry Kissinger and former CIA director Michael Hayden  and it has consistently lobbied for regime change in Syria and, you guessed it, Venezuela, where it has funnelled large amounts of money intopro-opposition groupsfor years  So, it s no surprise that weeks after Facebook partnered up with this less-than-objective group, it deleted from its platform the page belonging to top English-language, left-leaning Latin American news outlet Telesur without any explanation at all  The page was restored two days later, with Facebookcitingvague instability on the platform as the cause of the block  Telesur just so happens to be one of the only major outlets reporting on events in Venezuela in a manner that goes against the US government position and US mainstream media perspective  so obviously, out with Alex Jones it must go  It wasn t just Telesur, though  Facebook deleted the pages belonging to independent grassrootsVenezuela AnalysisandHaiti Analysis, which are also leftist websites highly critical of US foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean region  Facebook's shuttering of@telesurenglish's page comes days after it did the same to@venanalysispage w/o explanation  The latest outgrowth of FB's Orwellian partnership w/ the Atlantic Council  ICMYI,@MaxBlumenthaldiscussed it w/ me on@TheRealNews:httPS: //t co/3XayXXpg34httPS: //t co/ZgTaJv0rdU 2  Facebook complying with Israeli deletion orders Last year, journalist Glenn Greenwaldreportedthat Facebook met with Israeli government officials to determine which Palestinian activists should have their accounts deleted  The Israeli government threatened to enact laws forcing Facebook to comply with its deletion orders if it did not do so voluntarily  Of course, Facebook capitulated immediately and set about deleting accounts owned by Palestinian activists  Of some 158 requests submitted (over just four months) by Tel Aviv to Facebook asking for the removal of Palestinian content, 95 percent of them were granted  According to the same Intercept report,  Facebook hasn t been overly concerned about what Israelis themselves are saying on Facebook and even calls for murder can be ignored by the social media giant  3  Google and Facebook censorship of left/socialist websites The World Socialist Web Site reported last year that changes to Google s algorithms had seriously negatively impacted left-wing socialist and anti-war websites  An analysis by WSWS found that 13 such websites had seen their traffic plunge by a whopping 55 percent in the six months since Google had changed its algorithms  WSWS itself experienced a 74 percent drop in traffic between April and July last year  The changes also affected sites like Alternet, which saw its traffic plunge by 71 percent between April and September, Democracy Now (50 percent drop) and Truth-out org (49 percent drop)  Similarly, Police the Police (a page dedicated to exposing US police brutality) and the Free Thought Project (which focuses on government transparency) also saw their Facebook pagetraffic tankin 2018 after Facebook made changes to its newsfeed and search algorithms in an effort to combat fake news   PTP traffic dropped from between 12-15 million people per week to about 4 million  and the website had to fire its writing staff as a result  The left is cheering this on, when historically the left is usually the side cheering for free speech, PTP founder Jason Bassler told Mic  Amidst all of the celebration over the banning of Jones, some on the left cautioned that in fact, the left may indeed be the real target in all of this  and that those celebrating while people like Jones are banned are in fact being conditioned into accepting further censorship down the road  As we have been trying to tell you the real target for neoliberal corporate censorship was always the left  Now that they have conditioned public to accept it as a result of Russiagate, the left is in their crosshairs httPS: //t co/zt2oMIbtDC 4  Legitimate left-wing protests targeted? A particularly strange example of Facebook s commitment to banning fake news and promoting a nice, cozy atmosphere for everyone online is its decision to delete event pages for anti-racist and anti-fascist protests happening in Washington D C  The No Unite the Right 2-DC event (a counter-rally against a previous white nationalist event in the city) was taken down after Facebook decided it displayed some coordinated inauthentic behavior (the kind of random phrase that can no doubt be arbitrarily applied to anything without explanation)  The event organizer said in a statement: This is a real protest in Washington, D C  It is not George Soros  It is not Russia  It is just us  5  Twitter suspending and banning anti-war activists Twitter has come under fire recently for shadowbanning conservative accounts, making them harder to find on the platform and having their tweets appear less prominently in people s feeds in an effort to limit their audience  But again, it s not just the right  Twitter recently suspended the accounts of Daniel McAdams, the executive director of the libertarian and antiwar Ron Paul Institute and Scott Horton, the editor of the AntiWar com website  Explaining what happened, McAdamssaidthat he and Horton were suspended after defending former US diplomat Peter Van Buren who had just beenbannedpermanently from Twitter after heated exchanges with journalist Jonathan M  Katz over what Van Buren said was his unwillingness to challenge government lies   In one of his tweets to Katz, Buren sarcastically commented:""I hope a MAGA guy eats your face""  Katz reported him for""promoting violence""and Twitter later caved and removed Buren's account  A note from Peter Van Buren@wemeantwelland a screenshot of the boo hoo little bitch who tattled on him pic twitter com/qKukwabnyd In explaining his suspension, Twitter told McAdams that he could not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease  none of which he accepts that he did  Perhaps the really amazing thing about all of this is that it is happening in front of our eyes and the powers that be are not even bothering to lie about it  Elected US officials are openly promoting this kind of censorship as a way to prevent the""sowing of discord""among populations  At a Senate Judiciary Committee last year about Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online, Democratic Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono called on social media platforms to prove their commitment to preventing the fomenting of discord online  Working hand-in-glove with governments, corporations like Facebook have been handed enormous power to decide what constitutes free speech and which opinions are worthy of being heard  How long will it be before people realize banning Alex Jones wasn t really a victory at all?

"11 Aug, 2018", Hyperactive French Russophiles study lands Soros-backed DisinfoLab in Twitter data abuse scandal,"Once a leader in philosophy and fashion, France has now been reduced to falling for tricks recycled from US con artists by Brussels-based grifters, with a little help from Twitter s mea culpa cash and even Uncle George Soros  It all began when EU DisinfoLab, a non-governmental organization based in Belgium,published a reporton Wednesday about how some 55,000 hyperactive twitter accounts spread the news of the Benalla affair, and accused a portion of those accounts of being Russophiles  Within a day, French media were printing headlines screaming about Russian bots, prompting the NGO to issue a clarification of their findings  Not all of the accounts were Russophiles, the outfit said, and the report said nothing about bots but the French public was already outraged  PoliticiansJean-Luc Melenchonof La France Insoumise andMarine Le Penfrom the National Rally (NR) previously known as Le Front National who both ended up on the NGO s list, tweeted derisively about the report, with Melenchon calling the outfit stupid spooks  EU DisinfoLab basically used tools as well as funding provided by Twitter to compile a list of accounts tweeting about the scandal involving Alexandre Benalla, deputy chief of staff and bodyguard to President Emmanuel Macron  Benalla was fired in Julyafter it emergedhe had assaulted a protester at May Day demonstrations while impersonating a police officer, then tried to suppress the video footage of the incident  Of the accounts thus rounded up, the group identified 27 percent as being part of the Russian disinformation ecosystem, described as people retweeting content from RT and Sputnik, or promoting the Russian narrative  Examples of the latter were listed as people spreading false information like that the Syrian government did not use chemical weapons in Douma (#SyriaHoax) or doubting the official [UK] narrative about the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury  Having thus characterized the doubters of the official Western media narratives as Russian agents, the group had the cheek to declare this is not a value judgment, but a quantifiable fact according to methodology  What methodology?

"20 Jul, 2018",Are US media outlets repentant about reporting on DNC emails alleged hacked by the Russians ? No,"US media outlets have few regrets about reporting on the shady practices of the DNC, Hillary Clinton s private speeches, and other scoops revealed by emails allegedly leaked by Russian hackers, The Washington Post reports  Erik Wemple, The Washington Post's media critic, decidedto reach outto American news organizations after Neera Tanden, the president and CEO of the Soros-funded, Clinton-friendly Center for American Progress, accused every reporter who gleefully trafficked in stolen emails via Wikileaks of abetting a crime not illegal activity by itself but unethical and immoral  A reminder: every reporter who gleefully trafficked in stolen emails via wikileaks abetted a crime  Not illegal activity by itself but unethical and immoral  The curious media critic posed an intriguing question to some of America s most prominent outlets: Do you have regrets about reporting on the email leaks, now that Robert Mueller has indicted 12 Russians for allegedly hacking into the DNC and other entities? Their answers some more defensive and self-righteous than others could best be summed up as: No, not really  In the WashPost,@ErikWempleasks numerous media outlets if they regret reporting on the newsworthy aspects of the DNC & Podesta emails (which, contrary to the inane clichÃ©, has nothing to do with risotto recipes)  Their basic answer: no; that's our jobhttPS: //t co/AmV4AAU5PS Nearly all of the outlets pointed to the fact that the leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, contained information that the American people deserved to know  The stories that came from the emails were newsworthy  Not only Donna Brazile s question sharing, but the details of Hillary Clinton s speeches to Wall Street, speeches she had declined to make public, New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet wrote to Wemple  Imagine if we had chosen not to publish those emails at the time, interesting details about a presidential candidate in the middle of an election  That would have been a political act  Geoffrey Ingersoll, editor in chief of the Daily Caller, asked aloud whether journalism would even exist if newsrooms discarded leaks based solely on whether the source (alleged or known) had honourable intentions  If [the emails] are true and damning, do we ignore them because of the messenger? How much swampy oppo research fuels journalism for the betterment of democracy? Probably a lot, I would guess Ingersoll said  He then went on to point out that the media happily reported on salacious allegations leveled against Donald Trump by the Steele dossier even though the sensational document could not be verified and was compiled by retired UK intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who was paid $168,000 to do opposition research on Trump for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign and the DNC  We were selective in publishing from the available emails  Our standard was whether they contained information genuinely relevant to voters, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said on behalf of her own paper  Not publishing anything merely leaves a vacuum for others to fill, working with a lower standard or none at all  We published according to our standard, and we stand by our decision  HuffPost s Washington bureau chief during the 2016 campaign, Ryan Grim, said that his website repeatedly pointed to allegations that Russia was behind the email leaks, but emphasized that any fallout from their contents had to be blamed on Clinton and Clinton alone  I don t quite understand the argument that you would ignore something newsworthy  The excerpts from the [Clinton Wall Street] speeches were probably the most memorable things that surfaced, he wrote  The irony is that was an own-goal from start to finish  The Clinton campaign certainly can complain that Russia hacked and dumped that material  But Russia didn t force her to give the speeches and Russia didn t force her to keep the speeches a secret  Wemple s survey also put to bed the notion that the emails contained nothing newsworthy in them  Just take the [former DNC chair Donna] Brazile situation: Revelations about her question-sharing shed light not only on a top DNC official but also on the role of cable-news networks in choosing presidential candidates and the penetration of news organizations by partisan pundits, he noted  And we re supposed to pass up such a story? At the very least, Wemple has offered up a fresh take on who can or should read Wikileaks  After all, CNN s Chris Cuomo claimed in October 2016 that it was illegal for the public to read the leaked emails  This job, according to Cuomo, was reserved exclusively for trustworthy media outlets like CNN  CNN falstely states that it unlawful for the public--but not for CNN--to search WikiLeaks#PodestaEmailspic twitter com/sZMoM9iT2i Of course, the notion that Russian hackers delivered the emails to Wikileaks is a completely unproven allegation perhaps a fact that all the US outlets above continue to struggle with  ",https://www.rt.com/usa/433844-media-coverage-dnc-emails-russia/

Russia, of course  Making an appearance at the Trento Economic Festival, Sorossaid, without a shred of evidence to support his claims, he was""very worried about Russia's influence on Europe in general and on the new Italian government  ""I do not know if Salvini was funded by Moscow, but public opinion would have the right to know,""he said  He also expressed his concern over the new government scallfor ending EU sanctions on Russia  Such comments must be deeply disconcerting, if not insulting for many intelligent, free-thinking Italians  Aside from the obvious interference in the affairs of a foreign state, something Soros native Hungaryunderstandsvery well, Soros is basically saying that the Italian voter lacks the mental capacity for coming to the conclusion that Italy s immigration policy is deeply flawed, as even Soros himself hasadmitted  Thus, the only reasonable explanation for the dramatic change in Italy's political climate, the argument goes, is Russian meddling  Soros condemnation of Russia, aside from being unfounded and slanderous, is dripping with hypocrisy considering the huge sums of money he has put into lobbying EU politicians to accept his plans for a border-less world  Salvini, meanwhile, saying he felt ashamed that Soros was invited to speak at the economic festival, defended himself against the accusations, declaring he has never received any lira, euro or ruble from Russia  He then went on to defend Vladimir Putin,callinghim one of the best statesmen in the world  The League's economics policy chief, Claudio Borghi, also hit back,tweeting:""Soros worried by the Italian government? Then it means that we are going in the right direction    The wind has changed for [Soros] and for all those who have profited from the deaths of hundreds of people "" Soros, at a sprightly 87-years old, did not waste the opportunity while in Italy to express his indignation towards Donald Trump, the US leader who was also smuggled into power, according to the Democrats and various Russophobes, by the Kremlin  Once again, the underlying message here is that the Americans, like the Italians, are simply incapable of formulating any sort of an intelligent opinion for themselves  After 12 years of war and stagnant economic growth under former presidents George W  Bush and Barack Obama, the US electorate should have been simply ecstatic over the possibility of Hillary Clinton, yet another pro-war establishment figure, getting into the White House  And if things somehow turned out otherwise - indeed, as they most certainly did - well, it must have been due to the Russians  According to this delightful bit of absurdity, Russian trolls managed to swing themulti-billion dollarUS presidential election in their favor due to a few hundred tweets and Facebook advertisements  And yes, there are people who actually buy that story  By refusing to admit that failure is an integral part of the democratic process, individuals like George Soros and Hillary Clinton will simply lie, cheat and hoodwink the system media, judicial and political until they get their way  And that is precisely what is now happening in the United States  Despite Russiagate disintegrating into an embarrassing 'he said, she-said' National Enquirer expose, complete with an adult-film star, Trump continues to be embroiled in an investigation that has entered its second year  The crazy can be expected to continue at least until congressional midterms in November  If the Democrats are able to clinch victory, the world will most likely be treated to many months, maybe years, of impeachment proceedings against the most controversial political figure to grace the halls of Washington in a long time  Say what you will about Trump, but the fact that the establishment will go to such incredible lengths to discredit him means they genuinely fear him  Why is a completely different question  There is an upside to all of this madness, at least as far as Russia is concerned  By continually and predictably resorting to the Russia card whenever things don t go their way, which has been rather frequently of late, people like Soros and Clinton, the so-called globalists, only serve to cheapen and invalidate their transparent agenda  Ironically, Soros borrowed exactly the same argument against Russia that the Clinton campaign used: The Kremlin is trying to weaken the EU  What impeccable logic! The fact is that, if Putin or anyone else was really interested in weakening the EU or the US (if such a thing were even possible), they would not trouble themselves by putting populist politicians in power, who would work to reverse the rot of unregulated immigration, and other such irritants  In fact, they would just let Soros and his merry band of mischief makers continue doing exactly what they have been doing all along: destroy the EU from within with a disastrous agenda  In closing, it bears mentioning that President Putin justsigned a lawmandating the implementation of counter-sanctions against any state or person involved in hostile actions against Russia  Whether that legislation works to tame the anti-Russia hysteria now inflaming the planet with fake news remains to be seen  @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428811-soros-italy-putin-eu/

"1 Jun, 2018",Brussels sees threat to democracy everywhere liberals don t win Hungarian foreign minister,"The EU doesn t know how to deal with its member Hungary, where the strong prime minister, Orban, dares to defy Brussels vision for the future  How will Hungary hold up under pressure and how will this dispute shape the EU? We talked to the foreign minister of the country, Peter Szijjarto  Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, it s really good to have you on our programme again  Welcome back  Peter Szijjarto: It s my honour  Thanks for letting me be here  SS: Lots to talk about There are tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over the rights of the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Ukraine  And you have said that Ukraine stabbed Hungary in the back   What is Hungary s reaction going to be? PS: Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the European Union to help the Ukrainians to get the visa-free regime and to make the EU-Ukraine Association agreement to come into force  And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue  So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine  SS: So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn t abide by Ukrainian laws  Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? PS: Well, you know, we are part of the alliance  So it s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro-Atlantic integration path  And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities  The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities  So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission  SS: So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? PS: There s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the European Union about how we see this situation  We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations  We will see whether there s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that  SS: Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs  You ve said those are lies  Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? PS: We had and we re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know  We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti-migration policy  We made it very clear that it s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary  It s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together  We don t want to let neither the European Union nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don t want to invite  We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us  And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept  He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis  He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states  So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament  And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach  You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context  SS: Are they groundless? PS: Yeah, absolutely  I mean, just let me give you two examples  All these accusations say that there s no media freedom in Hungary  But if you look in the Internet, for example, if you look at the web-pages you will see that anti-government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive  In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country  In some Western European countries it did happen  Or when it comes to anti-Semitism - it s a constant accusation against us  Although we re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti-Semitism  There s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest  We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well  It s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets SS: in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely  PS: and compared to that we re always under accusations  SS: Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary - and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights  Could it come to that? PS: There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well  So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland  We opposed that because we absolutely think it s based on double standards  When you take facts into consideration there s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary  For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system  But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court  So these are all closed issues  So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament - these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary  SS: So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary  And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn t meet those demands whether it s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: We may not fund you in the next EU budget   Here s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to   6 percent of your budget  First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr  Orban said: We don t need German money anyways     PS: Well, you know, Hungary s interest is the European Union to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong European Union  We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the European Union  We have an export-to-GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the European Union to be strong and to have a competitive economy  On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy  But this is not a one-way road  We don t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends  These funds are to be given to us based on contracts  Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit  This is one lane of the road  And the other lane of the road is the European funding  So, this is not a one-way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation  We totally reject that false context, we re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free  This is not true  We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well  And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies  SS: There s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland - the East vs West - because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point  I don t think Brussels likes it    What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? PS: We re absolutely interested in the unity of the European Union  We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the European Union because the European Union must show unity  Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let s put it this way, well, it s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the European Union  We are the two countries where a one-party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country  We have absolutely stable political systems  Many times it s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels  There s a big debate in the European Union whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way  The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because SS: yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration  That s what France and Germany want  Do you think it s a viable thing? PS: Our position is that European Union can only be strong if there are strong member states  So we don t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong European Union would be realistic  We think that only strong member states can form a strong European Union  That s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the European Union, meaning that we don t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized  What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking  Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes  But the answer shouldn t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes  SS: Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the European Union as an alliance of sovereign states  European Union is the union that crosses state boundaries  It s, like, the core principle of the European Union  European Union is based on the principles of liberalism  Your country is a nation-based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing  Russia s same way  On ideological level there are so many differences  In a basis it s not even economics  Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? PS: Well, actually, it s not everything SS: But core things    PS: Yeah, but if you look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we re somewhere in the middle, so, there s nothing extraordinary in this regard  We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well  For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable  If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course  That s why what we re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit-based society  There are debates about that as well  But all in all our interest is the strong European Union because within the strong European Union Hungary can be strong  SS: There s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are sandbags that can be thrown away  Could it come to that? PS: Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland - the Visegrad countries - are members of the European Union and will be members of the European Union  Even more than that  This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the European Union  Our growth rate is much higher than the European average  Everybody speaks about the German-French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness  But if you look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France  That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong  Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy  So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the European Union because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the European Union being strong as well  That s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us  SS: The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now  There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions  There s the center - Brussels, France and Germany - who want more integration and maybe a two-speed Europe  It s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now  Something needs to change  We don t really know what  Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won t be as integrated as France and Germany? PS: If you mean that the European Union is faced with historic challenges, you re right  Not only one  We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with  So that s why I think it s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the European Union because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states  For instance, take the migration issue - Hungary s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country  SS: I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway  What s the point of being so tough on it if you were going to secretly accept those people anyway? PS: These are two totally different things  Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth  These two things shouldn t be confused because these are two different issues  SS: The mood in the European Union in general is changing  Austria has the first anti-immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far-right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it s pretty much center-right as well  Do you feel like saying we ve told you so, we ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying ? PS: You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right  But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the European Union the main issue was migration  That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary  And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti-migration policies  You ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who s definitely representing an anti-migration policy  In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti-migration parties  In Hungary we ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country  You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior  And you ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France  You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth  So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn t serve the target of a better future of the European Union  SS: So how come so many countries in the EU are anti-immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that  Just as many countries are against anti-Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending   them all of them agree silently to extend them  Why can t you be as firm on anti-Russia sanctions? PS: Well, if you ask me whether there are double standards I would say yes   We are a small country  And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here  If you come to the St -Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries  If you see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents  If you look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved  If you look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised  If you ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are  There s a big debate in the European Union whether the sanctions were successful or not  But definitely the unity of the European Union is very important  SS:    Even if it is at the expense of the anti-Russian sanctions?

what one might someday recognize as Orwell's ""Ministry of Truth "" Recent events over past months have caused many to suspect the reliability of news and information provided to us, often by our own governments  Alternative news sources threaten to disrupt the message or narrative crafted by governments and large organizations  The US Global Engagement Center is mobilizing in response to counter alternative media, conflicting perspectives and foreign influence such as Russian Propaganda  The rush to judgement, complete failure to follow international norms, and subsequent actions in response to both the alleged poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in the UK and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria leaves many questions unanswered  That narratives of government officials and mainstream media (MSM) are in lockstep despite the lack of any real evidence makes one suspicious of the ultimate objectives  Whatever these objectives may be, they certainly appear misplaced and bring increased international tension  Both these instances have the appearance of false flag operations  However, despite the lack of a thorough investigation, British Prime Minister May was quick to state the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent, Novichok, and claimed it was highly likely that it was the Russian government behind the attack   Both the UK and Russia are signatories of the internationalChemical Weapons Convention  There are setproceduresto be followed in the event of the suspected use of chemical weapons, such as Novichok, which include notification of the OPCW, cooperation of state parties and the instigation of a fact-finding investigation  These procedures were not followed and, in fact, Russia has yet to be included in the investigation or even provided samples  There seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding so many aspects of the entire incident  Despite the lack of evidence and the fragmentation of the initial storyline, the Skripal poisoning served certain interests by diverting attention away from the UK government and toward Russia  The subsequent mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK, US and EU countries caused the further deterioration of international relations  Throughout this period, MSM toed the party line and lately it appears to have gone silent  Closely following the Skripals poisoning, surprise-surprise, the famed White Helmets released a video of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria   Once again, despite no evidence and prior to the arrival of OPCW inspectors, the US, UK, and France launched airstrikes against Syria, targeting supposed chemical weapons facilities  There has yet to be any indication that a chemical weapons attack actually took place   Local citizens and doctors have testified recently that there was no chemical attack and that the incident was staged  Once again, MSM fails to cover the inconsistencies of the story which call in to serious question the actual occurrence of the attack  Information from MSM sources, for the most part, is completely in compliance with information either being filtered or suppressed to support the desired narrative  The storylines, absent of credible facts or evidence, is reminiscent of the Trust Me! approach regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction that led to Operation Iraqi Liberation (renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom)   The most recent instances add to the ongoing Russophobic hysteria engulfing the West under a very questionable pretext  Those that are skeptical of the official narrative or act to provide a differing perspective are frequently ridiculed and demonized, often accused of being one of Putin s useful-idiots  The list seems to be endless and spans from Russian scholarProfessor Stephen Cohenand Australian journalistJohn Pilgerto UK Labour leaderJeremy Corbynor, at times, even theRepublican Party  This past year we have seen many alternative media sources essentially blacklisted by the secretive organizationPropOrNotwhichpublishedthe names of more than 250 alternative news sources, accusing them of being Russian agents  The Washington Post promoted thestoryand, originally, ProporNot s List    Only later did the Post add an introductory comment and delete the direct link to the List  The story was subsequently picked up and distributed by theDaily BeastandUSA Today  InOctober, another blacklist surfaced, identifying more than 2,300 guests of the Russian news station, RT  The list was published by a Czech Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), European Values, whose largest donor just happens to be George Soros Open Society Foundation in addition to US, UK, and EU government contributions  We often view that the foundation of democracy lies in the freedom of one s beliefs, in one s right to express ourselves whether that is through print, speech, or the sharing of ideas  The First Amendment enshrines these concepts with the Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom to Assemble  Yet the ability to shape those ideas and thoughts relies on the ability to have open access to information and to participate in a dialogue of our beliefs and ideas  With the advent of media, and more recently with the internet and social media, access to and sharing of information with differing views has expanded immensely  However, recent initiatives have acted to stifle this open and free communication   The passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (P L  114-328, FY 2017 NDAA, section 1287) codified the Global Engagement Center and significantly expanded its role  The Global Engagement Center (GEC) evolved from the original Counterterrorism Communications Center (CTCC)  The CTCC was established in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11   Its objective was the coordination inter-agency messaging and to coordinate specific messaging for the Department of State and Department of Defense   The CTCC went through several restructurings through the years until it was the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communication (CSCC) with essentially the same mission  The organization had minimum funding and no direct line item from Congress  President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13721 in March 2016, which officially established the GEC in lieu of the CSCC  The GEC purpose and structure were similar to the CSCC  It was tasked with leading inter-agency efforts in support of US government-sponsored counterterrorism communications  Section 1287 states that the GEC s purpose is to counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts that threaten US national security interests as well as security interests of US allies and partner countries  This significantly changes the GEC s role from one of counterterrorism to one of countering foreign communications per se  Moreover, it provides the new GEC with significant resource authorizations well beyond those previously provided  Along with the significant expanded mission area and increased authority, the GEC will receive substantially greater funding and will include direct funding from Congress as well as authority for an additional $60 million to be transferred from the Department of Defense  The GEC expansion of responsibilities is a result of the challenges of articulating a consistent message and to counter alternative information and perspectives  Legislation seeks to strengthen the GEC in order to counter foreign influence, primarily Russian and Chinese disinformation efforts  This evolution of the GEC is not without challenges  Earlier versions of the GEC were underfunded and undermanned   The legislation and subsequent mission shift has been given to an organization operating with a focused mission to counter primarily extremist terrorism and ill-prepared to counter global information flows with varying perspectives  For instance, based on theNew York Times, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department s Global Engagement Center which has been tasked with countering Moscow s disinformation campaign speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts  As implied byVanity Fair, resource challenges, a changing mission, new technology, organizational confusion, and leadership uncertainty have contributed to the questionable performance and future of the GEC   Yet, the NDAA 2017, as well as more recent emphasis fromCongress, provide the clear intent from Congress for the increased global role of the GEC, along with the authority and resources to support it  This, along with the recent confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new GEC leadership, may see the GEC rapidly evolve to complete its transformation and become the master of information  Congressional pressure on technology companies, specifically social media organizations, throughout the evidence-free Russiagate hearings has contributed to filtering what and how we access information   Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been grilled in hearings and are taking steps to control the flow of information  Facebook has engaged fact-checkers to verify information  One wonders who checks the fact-checkers?  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google have also developed filters and Trust Indicators to prioritize what is seen, or not seen, and how, byusers  This is done in the name of combating fake news or countering alleged Russian propaganda  These actions, as well asdemonetizingsites, controlling advertising (RT and Sputnik advertising banned on Twitter), censoring information (SouthfrontandVeterans Today),de-ranking as with RT, or cancelling and suspending accounts (SyrianGirl banned on Facebook and YouTube) directly influence one s access to information, essentially censoring for the good of the public  Censorship and disinformation infringes on our ability to access factual information, to form our own judgements, to enlighten ourselves to differing perspectives   It essentially acts to shape our perspectives to preconceived narratives that may be counter to our own underlying values  It is a realization of George Orwell s Newspeak    It is a direct attack on the most fundamental right of a free and open society the right of free speech   We have been gradually witnessing the erosion of the underlying principles of democracy  The threat is not from any foreign power, it s from within  Where are we going as a country?  Are we reincarnating McCarthyism?  Are we nurturing an Orwellian society?

"11 Apr, 2018",Foreign mass media flouted Russian law & pedaled propaganda in election coverage senators,"The Upper House Commission for the Protection of State Sovereignty has registered more than 1,000 incidents of the western mass media meddling in the recent Russian presidential polls  The overall number of negative reports relating to the election was some 55 times bigger than ones with a positive outlook  Over the period of our monitoring we have found over 1,000 mass media reports that described elections or mentioned them indirectly, but these were not just informational reports  Foreign mass media have deliberately engaged in propaganda, in Russian and on Russian territory, head of the commission, Senator Andrey Klimov, was quoted as saying Wednesday by TASS  Most of these reports originated from the US mass media, Klimov noted  They [US media] published over a half of the   total number of reports, and also mass media from Great Britain, France and Germany  Over the campaign period for one positive report we counted 55 reports or articles that were deeply negative  Klimov also said that 12 Russian-language outlets belonging to western mass media directly violated Russian law when they released propaganda targeting Russian voters  Most of them are organizations that get their funding in the United States, usually through the US State Department as they are parts of the so-called BBG [Broadcasting Board of Governors]  Western journalists had attempted to sully President Vladimir Putin s reputation, promoted candidates that had the weakest voter support and also slandered the electoral process, according to Klimov  Foreign mass media, he said, had continued to report on the day of the election and the day before  Releasing any information about the election during that period is not permitted as there is a moratorium in place  Klimov noted that many of the western journalists concentrated on the so called voters strike which confirmed the foreign origins of this campaign, even though some Russian activists also promoted it  The head of the commission said that western countries invested serious time and effort to promote the bypassing of official internet blocks while guaranteeing absolute anonymity to users  They do not spare money for this  The BGG allocated $25 million in 2017 alone in order to overcome various barriers, Klimov said, noting that this system had been designed, not only for Russia, but also for China and Iran  Western nations, he noted, have changed the agenda from giving direct instructions for voters to embarking on various PR stunts and applying pressure with regard to sanctions  They are pushing feelings of horror and instability, releasing information that everything [in Russia] is bad, the markets are in fever and the oligarchs are fleeing the country  They are pushing these topics right now, said Klimov  The senator insisted that the non-governmental and non-profit organizations with foreign funding also attempted to influence the Russian elections, despite the restrictions and bans imposed on these so called foreign agents groups  He said that the US National Endowment for Democracy placed a lot of money into such Russian groups (96 grants were awarded in 2017 alone) and the Soros Foundation was very active in working with Russian organizations  The commission will release a more detailed report on foreign interference in Russian elections after Putin is sworn in as president on May 7  We have no doubts that this tremendous and massive campaign has failed  But still, we must remember that our partners refuse to calm down and continue to attack Russian sovereignty, Klimov concluded  ",https://www.rt.com/russia/423843-russia-elections-foreign-meddling/

"19 Feb, 2018",Indictment of Russians over US election meddling is case of pot calling the kettle black,"If the US federal grand jury indicts 13 Russians for meddling in the US vote with no allegations that it influenced the outcome, then the investigation by Mueller should disband and take its place on the garbage heap of history  F  Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst   At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily-critical technologies  Those cases served as an early warning to decision-makers of potential policy issues  He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia  F  Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst   At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily-critical technologies  Those cases served as an early warning to decision-makers of potential policy issues  He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia  On the face of it, to suggest that 13 Russian individuals attempted to alter the course of the US democratic election process is absolutely laughable, considering that the US mainstream media had teamed up with the Hillary Clinton campaign to barrage Americans daily with relentless stories of alleged Russian collusion with the campaign of Donald Trump to alter the 2016 election outcome  To date, no such collusion has been uncovered  If only 13 people allegedly attempted to alter the election outcome, you have to ask yourself: Is that all there is? So, 13 Russians allegedly planted ideas on popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where crazy ideas already abound  There never was any evidence in the indictment that even suggested any Russian attempt to manipulate through hacking voting stations  The alleged disinformation campaign amounted to calls for demonstrations or the printing of ads, which in many instances were hilarious Certainly, discerning and naturally skeptical Americans know the difference and have never thought that alternative ideas were a threat to the US democratic system, whether it s by Russians or even American billionaires who use their fortunes to try and alter the US political process  Indeed, ongoing congressional investigations reveal something even more sinister in the US democratic process  Namely, that the Clinton campaign paid for a so-called Russian dossier to undermine the Trump campaign and it was done in actual collusion with high-level officials of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  This is unprecedented in US politics and is tantamount to the action of a police state  And it was perpetrated by Democrats who concocted the Russian collusion scheme to discredit the legitimacy of the Trump election  If the US was inferring in the indictment that 13 Russian individuals sought to undermine the entire American democratic process, it is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black, since there are stark examples of past US efforts to interfere in elections and, indeed, overthrow democratically elected governments of other countries  Many of those past instances continue to have a major adverse impact on US influence in foreign policy  In 1953, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh  The impact culminated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and has affected what there is of US-Iranian relations to this day  During the administration of President Richard Nixon, he and his then-national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, were involved in the1973coup of democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende  Once again, the CIA was involved in the Chilean military s ousting of Allende, which then committed atrocities on its own citizens  In his 90s today, Kissinger continues to give President Trump foreign policy advice  Fast-forward to modern-day efforts to affect the outcome of elections in other countries, former president Barack Obama s repeated efforts to interfere in the elections of other nations are more numerous than most past US presidents  Ironically, the mainstream media played down those efforts  Among those examples, during the 2015 election in Israel, the Obama administration illegally attempted to prevent the re-election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to major personal and policy differences  The administration covertly funneled State Departmentgrantsto opposition groups to the tune of some $350,000, including a group called the One Voice Movement  One of Obama s field directors from his last presidential campaign actually oversaw the operation in an effort to topple the Netanyahu government  As usual, no one was held accountable  In 2014, the Obama administration was instrumental in supporting and helping to finance the violent overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych  To further underscore Obama s involvement in the internal affairs of another country, the American Spectatorreportedthat the government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, had obtained government documents showing that the US government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center-right government in Macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist George Soros  Judicial Watch further stated that then-Obama ambassador to Macedonia, Jeff Baily, sought to funnel millions of dollars from the State Department and USAID to groups created by Soros to overthrow the Macedonian government  In 2011, Obama was instrumental in the ousting of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to push the election of Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Morsi A secular leader, Mubarak was ousted, similar to Obama s efforts along with his then-Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in the violent military overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011  Based on what is now known, Clinton s hatchet man, Sidney Blumenthal, had helped provide information particularly on potential oil contracts in the country, which prompted her to convince an at-first reluctant Obama to take military action with a coalition of the willing from among NATO countries for regime change in Libya  Last, but not least, is the example of former President George W  Bush s 2003 invasion of Iraq, which led to the violent overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  As in the case of the 1953 coup in Iran, the US experience in Iraq has had a lasting impact on American influence not only in that country but throughout the entire Middle East  Ironically, US law prohibits the use of tax dollars to influence foreign elections  Clearly, if America doesn t want interference in its own democratic process, it shouldn t be doing it to other countries by overthrowing their governments and inflicting pain and suffering on the lives of millions of people  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/419221-us-meddling-iraq-libya/

Shortly after that tweet, Political Editor of Buzzfeed UK Jim Waterson, who was clearly suspicious about the interpretation, asked Harris Do you believe that headline? Harris immediately admitted that the headline was not completely accurate and that The lack of on Twitter, which is our caveat, is a bit problematic  So Harris, one of the leaders behind the report, was sharing a story which he almost immediately admits was not 100-percent correct  It was then pointed out by another Twitter user that, while 89up talked about Russian media achieving 134 million POTENTIAL impressions linked to the EU vote, Byline had removed the key word potential in its report  Impressions simply measure how many people may have potentially seen a tweet, even if that includes scrolling straight past it  A number of people insisted in relation to this report that it is more or less impossible to measure whether the tweets in question have any influence at all  In its report, 89up claimed: The Kremlin s propaganda channels had three times more impact on Twitter than both the official Leave campaigns combined  Whereas the opening of the Byline report claims New analysis by 89up org confirms the scale of Russian media influence during Brexit vote dwarfed the main Vote Leave and Leave EU campaigns, driving anti-EU propaganda, disinformation and fake news to influence voters  The claims in this opening paragraph in Byline are clearly different from its source material enough to be misleading about what was actually being claimed  There is no mention of Twitter, for example  While 89up cannot be held responsible for mistakes made by a separate outlet, questions should be asked about why one of the main drivers of the report was still willing to re-share information which he admits is misleading  Incorrect or misleading information being pushed by a separate entity on social media in order to influence an audience to come to a certain point of view is exactly how fake news is spread  Let's say RT ran months of exclusively pro-EU messaging, would your lobbying firm be investigating ""foreign interference""?

""The report shows the social reach of these anti-EU articles published by the Kremlin-owned channels was 134 million potential impressions "" Where were those impressions? If they were in America, for example, they're going to struggle to influence Brexit  No other state controlled media outlet came close to social exposure of Russian media  If anything, this is congratulations to RT s social media department, because that is kind of their job, to get stories read  It s not more sinister just because it s linked to the word Russia, and perhaps there should be some examination about whether there is a widespread demonization happening here  The claims include that RT and Sputnik are different from other media outlets because, among other things, they re state-funded and appear to be about soft power and influence  Does that remind you of anyone else? (Y know, the BBC, the corporation which faces constant accusations of anti-Brexit bias ) Optimistically, 89up says it has handed its report to the British Parliament s Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and called on parliament to investigate role of UK-based Russian propaganda outlets  The group of MPs looking into alleged Brexit meddling has continuously failed to find evidence that it actually happened, so it will probably gratefully accept the report  More revelations are promised in the coming days, but based on the opening accusations, no one should expect to see a smoking gun  ",https://www.rt.com/uk/418585-89up-brexit-meddling-soros/

Meet the foreign billionaires pulling Britain s political strings,"As a Russian woman a UK citizen with tenuous ties to Putin is exposed as a Tory Party donor, RT looks past the media s anti-Kremlin obsession to meet the foreign billionaires who actually have sway over British politics  The Mirror reported that Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former crony of Vladimir Putin (ex-Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Chernukhin), paid £30,000 (US$41,450) in donations to the Conservatives to dine with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson  Chernukhin s successful bid at the Tories lavish Black and White Ball fundraiser will also get her a private tour of Winston Churchill s War Rooms in Whitehall with Williamson  Chernukhin who is a banker in her own right, but (according to the Mirror at least) resides in her husband s shadow is now a British citizen  Previous Tory Party conferences have seen her successfully bid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and £20,000 to dine with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson in Edinburgh  If one puts the mainstream media s Russia-hating agenda aside for just a moment, however, it s clear a number of other international billionaires actually wield influence over the UK s political landscape  The Aussie businessman and easily the most influential person in media  He s also the man behind pro-Tory newspapers the Sun and the Times  His publications have made their allegiances to the Conservative Party clear  The Sun openly backed the Tories in the 2017 General Election betting on the winning horse yet again  In the lead-up to last year s ballot, Murdoch reportedly told his employees at the Sun and the Times that the future of the company was dependent on the Tories winning the election, and told them to be harsher on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  Meanwhile, the 2011/2012 Leveson inquiry into media standards and ethics in the UK revealed that Murdoch had been in close contact with every prime minister in recent decades, including Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron  The anti-Brexit Hungarian-born billionaire, who s a citizen of the US, is bankrolling a campaign to stop Brexit and if that isn t international meddling, then we just don t know what is  On Monday it was revealed that Soros has pledged another £100,000 to his anti-Brexit campaign  Soros said that engineering a mere reversal of the EU referendum result was simply not enough  The cash is on top of the £400,000 he donated last week to the Best for Britain organization to fund a nationwide anti-Brexit campaign  Before that, he donated £700,000 to not only stop Brexit in its tracks, but to reverse the process entirely  Technically, Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere (let's call him Rothermere for short) is British  He s the chairman of DMG, which runs the Daily Mail and Metro, and both push a Conservative agenda  While he may have been born in Hammersmith, Rothermere has non-domicile tax status  In other words, he lives in France, dodges tax and owns his media businesses through a complex structure of offshore holdings and trusts  In April 2015, the Sunday Times estimated his net worth was £1 billion  That s a lot of cash to splash around if you want things your way  READ MORE:  David Cameron took on Britain's most powerful newspaper editor over Brexit while PM     and lost Owners of the Telegraph Media Group, David Barclay and Frederick Barclay are estimated to be worth £7 2 billion, according to the Sunday Times Rich List of 2017  Among other companies, they own the Telegraph Group Limited, parent company of conservative-aligned papers The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph  They ve been accused of tax avoidance, placing their assets under complicated trusts and ownership to dodge the taxman  The reclusive duo is notorious for avoiding publicity, so David's son Aidan manages their businesses in the UK  The two brothers bought the lease of Brecqhou Island in 1993, off the coast of Sark (one of the smallest of the British Channel Islands)  There they have been accused of meddling in local politics, including a mass-firing of 170 staff from Barclays-backed investments on the island as the locals did not support political candidates backed by the brothers  In another Sark scandal, the only doctor on the island left after he was slammed by a Barclays-owned local paper for using a boat rather than the Barclays' helicopter to transport a patient who was having a seizure to hospital on the nearby island of Guernsey  The Barclays' paper reported the doctor s actions as negligent, and despite support from the patient's family and the British Medical Association, the doctor left the island over the story  ",https://www.rt.com/uk/418560-russia-government-billionaire-influence/
"9 Feb, 2018",Soros & the £400k Question: What constitutes foreign interference in democracy?,"You d have to have a real sense of humor failure not to laugh  The news that US billionaire Soros donated £400k to an anti-Brexit group came on the day that YouTube said they found no evidence of Russian interference in Brexit  is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Repeat After Me (with robotic arm movements): Unproven Russian involvement in Brexit terrible! Impose more sanctions on Moscow! A £400k check from an American billionaire for an anti-Brexit campaigning group that s no problem; it s helping our democracy! You don t have to own a brand new £999 state-of-the art Hypocrisy Detector from Harrods, to pick up on the double standards  Just having a few functioning brain cells and thinking for yourself will do  For months in the UK we ve been bombarded with Establishment-approved conspiracy theories peddled in all the best newspapers that Russia somehow fixed Brexit  Getting Britain to leave the EU was all part of a cunning plot by Vladimir Putin, aka Dr  Evil, to weaken Europe and the free world  Even West End musical composer Andrew Lloyd-Webber, who knows quite a bit about phantoms, seemed taken in by it  By quitting Europe, I fear that we are hastening Putin s dream of the break-up of the EU and with it, potentially, western civilisation, the noble Lorddeclaredin July  Never mind that we don t have a single statement from Putin or other senior Kremlin figures saying that they actually supported Brexit  These Establishment Russia-bashers know exactly what The Vlad is thinking  And never mind that RT and Sputnik, which we are repeatedly told are propaganda arms of the Russian government, ran articles by pro- and anti-Brexit writers  The same people who told us Iraq had WMDs in 2003 were absolutely sure it was those dastardly Russkies who had got Britain to vote leave  The irony is of course that there was significant foreign interference in Brexit  But it didn t come from Moscow  Or Obama actually visiting the U K  to urge people to vote Remain  Imagine if Putin did the same for Leave! The US has always wanted Britain to stay in the EU  In April 2016, two months before the Referendum, President Obama made it clear what he wanted when he visited the UK  He warned that if Britain exited the EU it would be at the back of the queue for trade deals with theUS  Just imagine if Putin had said that  The Russophobes would have spontaneously combusted  Then of course there was the backing the Remain camp had from the giants of US capital Goldman Sachsand JP Morgan donated £500,000 each to the Britain Stronger in Europe group, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley £250,000 each  Again, repeat after me (with robotic arm movements): This is not foreign interference This is not foreign interference! You ve got to see the funny side of this: all that hysterical fake news about Russian interference in Brexit & here we have one side receiving £400K from a US billionaire who is part of the US political establishment  Is that not interference ?!!httPS: //t co/URzrB3ciLd The point is not whether we are for or against Brexit  Or whether we think George Soros is a malign influence who only acts out of self-interest or an old sweetie-pie with the good of humanity at heart  The point is the double standards that are causing our Hypocrisy Detectors to explode  Let s think back to December 2016  Then, the pro-war and fiercely anti-Russian Labour MP Ben Bradshaw told Parliament that it was highly probable that Russia had interfered with Brexit  Fourteen months on, what have we got? On Thursday, the global head of You Tube s public policy, Juniper Downs, said her company had conducted a thorough investigation around the Brexit referendum and found no evidence ofRussian interference  Twitter meanwhile says it detected 49 (yes, 49) accounts from what it claimed to be a Russian troll factory, which sent all of 942 messages about Brexit amounting to less than 0 005% of all the tweets about the Referendum  Twitter said the accounts received very low levels of engagement from users  If the Kremlin had planned to use tweets to persuade us to vote leave, they didn t really put much effort into it, did they? Finally, Facebook said that only three Kremlin-linked accounts were found which spent the grand sum of 72p (yes, 72p) on ads during the Referendum campaign  Which amounts to the greater interference ? 72p or £400K? Erm tough call, isn t it? You might have thought, given his concern with foreign interference in British politics, that Ben Bradshaw would have been urging Best for Britain to return George Soros donation  Au contraire! His only tweets about it were retweets of two critical comments about the Daily Telegraph, and the BBC s coverage of the story  Conclusion: Those who rail about Russia meddling in Brexit but not Soros intervention aren t concerned about foreign interference in UK politics, only foreign interference from countries they don t approve of  Those who are quite happy peddling ludicrous conspiracy theories about Russians shout conspiracy theorist (or worse) at those who report factually on proven meddling from others  The Daily Express hit the nail on the head in their Friday editorial which said: Just what does George Soros think he is doing pouring £400,000 into a campaign to stop Brexit  For a start he is not actually a resident of this country so it has nothing to do with him  That really is the rub of the matter  And Bradshaw and co  have no adequate response except to shoot the messenger  If we look at the affair with an even wider lens, the hypocrisy is even greater  The US has been gripped by an anti-Russian frenzy not seen since the days of Senator Joe McCarthy  The unsubstantiated claim that Russia fixed the election for Donald Trump is repeated by liberals and many neocons too, as a statement of fact  I don t know that the public understands the gravity of what the Russians were able to do and continue to do here in the United States  They ve attacked us  They re trying to undermine our democracy, film director Rob Reinersaid  But the number one country round the world for undermining democracy and interfering in the affairs of other sovereign states is the US itself  While Establishment journos and pundits have been foaming at the mouth over Russiagate and getting terribly excited over smoking guns which turn out surprise, surprise to be damp squibs, there s been less attention paid to the boasts of former Vice President Joe Biden on how he got the allegedly independent Ukrainian government to sack its prosecutor general in a few hours  I looked at them and said: I m leaving in six hours  If the prosecutor is not fired, you re not getting the money "" I said, I m telling you, you re not getting the billion dollars, Bidensaidduring a meeting of the US Council on Foreign Relations  Well, son of a b***h  He got fired  Again, just imagine the furore if a leading Russian government figure boasted about how he used financial inducements to get another country s Prosecutor General to be sacked  Or if a tape was leaked in which the Russian Ambassador and a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson could be heard discussing who should or shouldn t be in the new democratic government of another sovereign state  But we had the US Ambassador toUkraineand the US Assistant Secretary of State doing exactly that in 2014 and the Russia is interfering in the Free World! brigade were as silent as a group of Trappist monks  It s fair to say that Orwell would have a field day with the doublespeak that s currently on show  The cognitive dissonance is there for all to see  Repeat After Me: Unproven Russian interference Bad  Proven interference from other external sources Good  What s your problem?

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington  In recent years, the think tank business has exploded  But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group  Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders  However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non-Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like  And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations  Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages  That's 9th-century France, to be precise  But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today  The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie  And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong  Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization  With a 200-percent rise in numbers since 1970  And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington  One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia  Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups  Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia  Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO  The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America  However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media  Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills  What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being  Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world  For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially- wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark  Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, Michael Carpenter and their recent co-authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country  Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here  Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert who has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake  Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self-declared Russia analyst who, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian  Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve  NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow  The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State  Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing  Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw  This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there  Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States  What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia  It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry  For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister-looking countdown clock before the long-planned training commenced  CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War and dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation  Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years  Poland chooses Raytheon  Even if the missiles don't work, America will defend its customershttp://t co/QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past  Thus, he s more-or-less an out-of-touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise  He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill-informed than Lucas  His work for the US state-run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, where he has been based for some years  CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists  The former is a Polish-American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia-bashing world is  Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi-organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang-ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors  Which is, at least, honest  FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence  Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus  The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash  Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin  It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn-government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan  Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia  What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest  However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn  Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German-American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project  Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls  The reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly-funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify 'pro-Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views?

UK politician Nigel Farage, the prominent face of Brexit, is now concerned about Europe s destiny  Addressing the EU Parliament this week, Farage provided some thoughtful ideas as to the source of the claims that Russia had somehow manipulated the Brexitvote, as well as the Trumpelection  Just last week, the electoral commission, in the UK, launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money, Farage said  ""This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organization called Open Society  But Farage, who seems to take great delight in agitating his fellow MPs, was just warming up  He went on to provide yet another example of an EU parliamentarian working on behalf of George Soros, this time against Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, who hasaccusedthe financier of seeking to create a Europe of mixed population  We even had last week Mr  [Guy] Verhofstadtlobbyingon behalf of Mr  Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, Farage said, pointing directly at Verhofstadt as he spoke  I wonder, Farage continued, when we are talking about political collusion, I wonder if we are looking in the wrong place  FaragedescribedSoros s influence in Strasbourg and Brussels as truly extraordinary  And that influence looks set to increase dramatically now that Soros has donated the bulk of his wealth - $18 billion - into his Open Society pet project, which campaigns for open borders and supranational structures such as the European Union  Farage concluded his short, fiery monologue with a weighty statement: I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international, political collusion in history  On the surface, there seems to be some legitimacy to Farage s claim  According to public sources, Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of Open Society Foundations, met with members of the European Commission on 44 separateoccasionsin 2016  And now that the organization has just been energized with $18 billion, it would seem apparent that that influence is set to increase  Moreover, the Soros organizations published a pamphlet providing details on a list of 226 reliable friends who serve in the European Parliament  Farage said he would call on the parliament to set up a special committee to investigate the issue  In a 177-page pamphletpublishedby Open Society, entitled Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014-2019), 226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views  According to the pamphlet, The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support Open Society s work  Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, reliable allies of George Soros hold at least one-third of seats "" So what sort of qualifications does an MEP need to be included among Open Society s reliable allies? A quick preview of the candidate s description field provides some good indication as to what Soros expects from his allies, including a political philosophy that includes support of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or intersex) movement, open borders and an anti-Russia stance  Among the 226 chosen, there is one Yana Toom, an MEP from Estonia, who comes in for a bit of criticism despite her inclusion  Refused supporting the European Parliament s first resolution on the Ukraine-Russia conflict in July 2014, and may be pro-Russia to an unknown extent (and, in that case, not necessarily an Open Society)  For anyone who questions whether Open Society works directly against Russian interests, that single line should dispel all doubts  Moreover, it provides some background as to why Russia in 2015 banned Open Society from operating on its territory due to the threat itposedto the country s constitutional order  Another MEP on the list, Monica Macovei of Romania, serves as something like the golden mean for star-studded Soros status  Resolutely progressive; unquestionable ally of Open Society values; does not hesitate to go against her group s instructions; however, can sometimes be described as a loose cannon with her own, uncompromising set of priorities  When reading such an assessment, one might get the mistaken impression that the European Parliament is designed to serve the will of George Soros and his highly controversial agenda, as opposed to the will of the European peoples  To say that George Soros, who was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, has an influence on the global scene, would be the understatement of the century  His excessive wealth allows him to finance a veritablearmy of organizations, many serving at cross purposes  Indeed, Soros, 87, has been connected to movements and civil disturbances as diverse as distanced asBlack Lives Mattermovement in the US, to the Maidanuprisingin Ukraine  And nowhere has Soros s influence been more felt than in the ongoing European debate over migrants It looks like the European refugee crisis, which has been blamed on the Syrian civil war, would not occur in its current intensity without the direct assistance of the Open Society Foundation  Thanks to the advocacy work of the Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM), both Soros-sponsored organizations, the mass resettlement of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa into Europebecamethe norm  In fact, it appeared that the so-called Merkel Plan the deal struck by the EU and Turkey was the brainchild of the European Stability Initiative, in addition to the largesse of George Soros foundations, F  William Engdahlwrotein the Near Eastern Outlook  Considering that the massive influx of Muslim migrants threatens to change the face of Christian Europe forever, and without any vote on the matter by the people of Europe, perhaps it is time to see exactly what kind of direct influence George Soros and his Open Society Foundation are having on European parliamentarians  After all, these are not the play toys of any one individual, but the representatives of an entire state  George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state  This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Robert Bridge, for RT @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/news/410223-soros-allies-migrants-farage-orban/
"16 Nov, 2017",Magnitsky Act mastermind seeks to stop Cyprus from revealing his offshore assets to Russia,"A group of MEPs have urged Cyprian authorities not to cooperate with Russia on an inquiry against the man behind the Magnitsky Act, William Browder  Now, a Russian lawyer claims that Browder himself arranged this petition to hide data on his operations  Browder, a US-born British investor and the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, fears that his fraudulent investment schemes involving offshore assets in Cyprus would be revealed to European authorities if Cyprus continues to cooperate with Moscow on its probe against him, Natalya Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who conducted her own investigation into Browder's operations, told RT  She added that Browder is actively trying to paint the investigation against him as politically motivated  He [Browder] is afraid of the Russian probe that has conclusive evidence of his financial crimes and proof that his theory of Magnitsky s death is an absolute fake  That s why Browder is ready to stage any provocation, Veselnitskaya said  She went on to say that the investor s decision to intervene was particularly influenced by the fact that the entire network of offshore companies that make up his organized criminal group is located on the territory of Cyprus  The incident that Veselnitskaya was referring to took place in late October 2017  At that time, 17 members of the European Parliament appealed to Cypriot President Nikos Anastasiades in an open letter, in which they called on him to stop assisting Russia in its investigation against Browder  The MEPs particularly expressed their concerns over the fact that the Cypriot government is actively assisting the Russian government in furthering human rights violations through assistance with politically motivated prosecutions, in contravention of its obligations under European conventions, asreportedby the local Cyprus Mail daily  Even though the letter carried absolutely no legal weight and could not force Anastasiades to take any measures, the MEPs still sought to exert pressure on the Cypriot authorities by stating that the conduct of Cyprus in this case will have implications that go far beyond this case  The letter also explicitly stated that the investigation against Browder was of a political nature  While every other European country, Interpol and the Council of Europe have deemed the Russian proceedings against Browder to be politically motivated, your country has taken a contrary position, and agreed to provide assistance to a Russian politically-motivated process, clearly in violation of your obligations under the rule of law, the signatories to the letter said  Just weeks before the MEPs sent their letter to the Cypriot president, Browder himself filed a request to the court of Nicosia, asking for an emergency injunction against the transfer of any data concerning his activities in the island country to Russia  According to Veselnitskaya, the letter and the application filed by Browder were a double gambit by the criminal union between Browder and his lawyers: an attempt to interrupt the course of the investigation and interfere in the judicial process "" Notably, as many as 12 out of 17 European lawmakers who signed the letter, were mentioned in the so-called Soros list a document prepared for the Open Society European Policy Institute, which itself is part of the Open Society Foundations run by the US investor and hedge fund manager George Soros  Thedocumentpublished on the Internet after the mail server of the Open Society Foundations was hacked in 2016 lists those, whom it calls reliable allies in the European Parliament  The letter's signatories who are also""reliable allies""of Soros include socialists Ana Gomes, Pier Antonio Panzeri, and Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar; member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group Monica Macovei; liberals Maite Pagazaurtundua Ruiz, Petras Austrevicius and Fredrick Federley; greens Rebecca Harms and Judith Sargentini; and members of the European People s Party Christofer Fjellner, Lars Adaktusson, and Gunnar Hokmark  Two more signatories to the letter are Anna Fotyga and Sandra Kalniete, former foreign ministers of Poland and Latvia respectively, known for their initiatives to counteract Russian influence in Europe  In mid-October, even before the letter signed by the European lawmakers reached the Cypriot president, the Prosecution Office of Cyprus actually suspended cooperation with Russia on the investigation into the allegations against Browder  In particular, Cypriot authorities banned a Russian delegation from coming to the island in pursuit of the investigative procedures, citing the application filed by Browder, in which he claimed that the Russian investigation was politically motivated  The Russian Foreign Ministry suspected the Cypriot authorities' decision was influenced from abroad  We have serious doubts regarding the legality of that decision, which was made public before the court issued a decision on Mr Browder s action, as well as to whether Cyprus took the decision independently, the ministrysaidin a statement  Browder became known for his role in the adoption of the so-called Magnitsky Act the 2012 US regulation that imposes sanctions on Russian individuals and companies over alleged violations of human rights  Browder actively lobbied the act in the US and then also encouraged the European countries to follow suit and also imposed sanctions on Russia over alleged human rights violations  The investor, however, has a long history of animosity against Russia  In 2013, he was sentenced to nine years in prison in absentia for tax evasion  According to the 2013 court verdict, Browder together with his Russian auditor Sergey Magnitsky failed to pay over 552 million rubles in taxes (about $16 million)  The businessman was also found guilty of illegally buying shares in the country s natural gas giant Gazprom  According to the law enforcers, that cost Russia at least 3 billion rubles ($100 million)  Magnitsky died in pre-trial custody in 2009 after being detained as part of investigation in Browder s fraudulent financial schemes in Russia  His death allowed Browder to present the whole case as political persecution and lobby for the adoption of the Magnitsky Act in the US  ",https://www.rt.com/news/410008-browder-cyprus-offshore-investigation/

READ MORE: NGO publishes names of 2,300+ RT guests, labels them useful idiots who undermine Western democracy No, it makes me someone who s quadruple pissed off with people who attempt to understand the world from the perspective of conspiracy theories in the first place  I don t deny the existence of conspiracies: in fact, far from it, because they re everywhere  What I do deny is the implicit assumption that the conspirators understand the system they re attempting to manipulate  For example, I ve heard plenty of conspiracy theorists assert that the 2008 financial crisis was caused by the Federal Reserve/George Soros (Hi George!)/Hedge Funds/Academic-Economists-Who-Peddle-The-Efficient-Markets-Hypothesis, and they profited from it  This implies they knew what they were doing  Pardon me, but I ve met many of these protagonists and in the case of academic economists, I ve worked with them for 30 years  They don t have a clue (except George)  Even those that were actively conspiring like many hedge funds during the subprime bubble were doing so on the basis of utterly deluded theories about how the system they were trying to game actually worked  Where apparent conspiracies did work, likeSoros s puntagainst the British Pound decades ago, they did so because a CSP (Clever Sinister Person) bet against the conventional wisdom of others who thought they understood the system (and did not), rather than because the CSP set up the whole thing in the first place  As for the argument that I m unwittingly playing into Vladimir Putin s malevolent plans for Western democracy by being interviewed on RT, I have three rebuttals  The first and most important is that RT simply has better programs and better journalists than, for example, the BBC  I would gladly discuss issues such as what caused the 2008 economic crisis on the BBC, were I asked  But the BBC (and most other Western outlets that European Values and other conspiracy theorists think are superior to RT) just isn t interested in the issues  With precisely two honorable exceptions, BBC programs and its journalists have only been interested in a story involving me when there was a personality angle to it  I have been interviewed by the BBC 11 times since I arrived in the UK in mid-2014  Only two interviews were motivated by the journalist s or program s genuine interest in my non-orthodox approach to economics: a HARDtalkinterviewin August 2016, and an interview byAlice Baxterin January 2016  Fully six were about my friendYanis Varoufakiswhen he was Greece s finance minister  Two others were on November 3rd, 2016, about some news story that I ve since forgotten  And my most recentinterviewon the BBC, on September 14th this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Northern Rock, was the clincher for me  That failure was the most significant financial event in the UK in almost eighty years: it was the firstbankrun since the Great Depression  I was pleased to be asked to discuss it on air, and I expected a serious treatment of it  Instead, the item consisted of a two-minute introduction by one presenter, and a three-minute exchange with another which rates as one of the most vacuous interviews I ve experienced in forty-five years of being interviewed by journalists (my first was as a 19-year-old politically active student at the University of Sydney in 1972)  I did my best to answer inane questions seriously, but as one member of my Patreon community commented, you could see my answers parting the journalist s hair  That was a cruel remark, but frankly a fair one  Which raises the second riposte: why aren t there shows that are interested in the in-depth analysis of economic issues on the BBC? Shows like the RT staples on which I was and continue to be interviewed regularly:Capital Account,the Boom Bust, theKeiser Report,Renegade Inc, the 7pm News with Bill Dod, andGoing Underground  It s not because the programs were devised by dastardly Russian stooges: most of them were developed by independent broadcasters and pitched to a number of outlets  I know for a fact that at least one of these shows was pitched to the BBC before it was offered to RT  They weren t interested, but RT was  This isn t because the BBC and most Western media outlets were too highbrow for these programs: the opposite is more the case  The BBC and its commercial rivals seem more interested in infotainment than analysis, more concerned with filling time with fancy graphics and pretty (male and female) talking torsos, than in actually getting to grips with the serious economic issues in a seriously challenging world  The third rebuttal, which I ll develop in more depth in a later column, is that if I can help strengthen Russia as a rival axis of power to the USA, then I think that s a good thing  I d rather have a bipolar (or tripolar) battle for global dominance between two (or more) Superpowers, than have a unipolar world with a single Superpower, led by a leader with a bipolar personality  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/409261-soros-putin-conspiracy-keen/

"25 Oct, 2017", RT is accused & guilty of providing content that appeals to people ,"People wouldn t be watching RT if it was not providing high quality news content and a much-needed alternative viewpoint amid a mainstream media monopoly, media experts have told RT, noting that baseless criticism only fuels the channel s popularity  On Monday, the New York Times (NYT) accused YouTube of having a cozy relationship with RT, and which the publication believes, has contributed to the rise of the RT s popularity on the world s most visited video sharing site  Thearticleclaims that YouTube has played a crucial role in helping RT expand and significantly grow its audience base  Unacceptable! RT pulled from YouTube prime ad list in US without notice They had to attribute it to some form of collaboration or weird dealings because they couldn t just accept that RT is doing well by providing people [with] content that people will watch, Matteo Bergamini, the founder of independent youth news platform Shout Out UK, told RT  Independent journalist Derrick Droze agreed that the only thing the NYT succeeded in doing with its latest piece, is in fact, praising RT s quality content and efficient partnership with YouTube  It is kind of silly to see the New York Times and US government take this position because essentially what they are accusing RT of doing is knowing how to work YouTube, and knowing how to work algorithms and how to work content that appeals to people, Droze told RT  The way the article is written is so silly  They re just talking about that RT created content and it reached a young audience of people who want authenticity and who want real news, and who want news outside the US government's version of events, the journalist added  In particular, the NYT article criticized the compliments RT attracted from Robert Kyncl, who was YouTube s vice president at the time when RT smashed through the billion views milestone  In particular, Kyncl emphasized that RT offers authentic news content instead of agendas or propaganda, which helps the outlet to bond with its viewers  I think what users generally appreciate is authenticity  It is very apparent from everything that is going on on Youtube  So instead of having aspirational programming or agendas and propaganda, people really respond to authenticity, Kyncl told RT's Kevin Owen in 2013  The media experts agree with Kyncl's assessment offered years ago  RT is popular because it services people, because people find it interesting, not because of some kind of brainwashing or collusion, legal and media analyst Lionel said  In fact, YouTube hascontinuedto commend RT s content selection, production and audience retention throughout the years   RTrocketedto 5 billion views on YouTube in September, maintaining its undisputed leadership position among international news networks, and outstripping by far the total number of views for BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera and Euronews  Mouthpiece of neocon war machine : Freeman s War with Russia video creates stir on TwitterhttPS: //t co/9YMzl6KYwepic twitter com/5g6qyW0Rqb And while experts and YouTube itself agree that RT is succeeding in building strong connections with its vast audience, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)echoedthe NYT assessment, accusing not only Google, but also Facebook and Twitter of allowing the Russian news outlet to post unreliable, misleading and highly partisan content  And as is becoming customary, both outlets provided no concrete examples to back its claims  Log out of Facebook  Delete your Twitter  Sleep with one eye open Russians are everywhere (Op-Ed by Danielle Ryan)httPS: //t co/cDXBiqQs4B This kind of reporting by the WSJ and the NYT is tantamount to a witch hunt, Bergamini believes  It s a witch hunt for anybody that has any relationship with anything to do with Russia or anything Russian it seems, Bergamini said  [To say] that RT because they were successful on YouTube is somehow embedded with YouTube and therefore Google is just madness  [They] are choking out accusations without any real evidence whatsoever  In a recent drive to somehow tarnish the public view of RT, a lobby group funded by George Soros, along with the EU and US governments, targeted 2,327 people who appeared as experts and guests on RT  The report by the European Values think tank states that appearing on RT is counterproductive and makes the guest a useful idiot to a hostile foreign power  Expressing one s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to complicity with the Russian propaganda machine  But people are not idiots, and consciously chose to watch and appear on RT because the channel's content stands out from the mainstream media, argued Ray Finch, an MEP from the UK Independence Party (UKIP)  The fact of the matter is: ordinary people know where to get their news  They can choose anywhere they like    It seems that RT is giving some form of news that people like, and so people are consuming it  If they didn't like it, they are not forced to watch it, they can go and watch CNN or Al Jazeera or read the NYT online, Finch told RT  CNN is known worldwide now as the Clinton News Network, the BBC is the voice of the remainers as far as Brexit is concerned, Russia Today is what it says on the tin, it is backed by Russia  People take that into account  The NYT and people like that are assuming people are idiots, Finch said  Boris says Labour MPs speaking to RT is a scandal     despite his dad appearing only last month Just last week, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed that it was a scandal for Labour MPs to appear on RT  However, every time RT makes western media headlines, the reaction to the popularity of the channel only seems to grow, Lionel noted  If I didn t know better, I would swear RT is working on one of the most incredible stealth PR programs ever  Every time the New York Times or the Washington Post or anybody else does some exposÃ© about RT, it makes people in this country even more interested and more fascinated with what RT does, Lionel pointed out  Since RT registered on YouTube in 2007, the network has been constantly expanding its online presence, bringing to its viewers the latest and most viral news in a wide range of video formats, while exploring new designs  Last year, RT broke new ground in posting the first 360-degree HD video from aboard the International Space Station  RT s most popular videos over the last year include Donald Trump s victory speech after winning the presidential election, an interview with the President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, and a documentary about a hitman who worked for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar  RT s goal is, and has always been, to inform  The hysteria surrounding such mundane activities as RT s social-media advertising of its content  something done by practically all news organizations  speaks to the establishment s fear of losing the monopoly on information, and betrays a concerted effort to push RT out of the US market, RT said in astatementto the WSJ  Smoking gun or nothingburger? WaPo claims Russia meddled in election through Google, YouTube Droze believes there is a more sinister agenda behind the ongoing anti-RT campaign, and that is, to silence all alternative news flows  It is bigger than just going after Russia, Droze said  It is about alternative opinions and independent news that contradict the American audience  They want to limit that view on YouTube  They want to limit that view on Facebook  ",https://www.rt.com/news/407690-rt-content-youtube-partnership/
"22 Oct, 2017", Report listing RT s guests is designed to intimidate',"A new report by a US-funded Czech think tank that targeted RT s on-air guests is an attempt to stifle any views that go outside the accepted US neocon foreign policy of interventionism, Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute, told RT  The group, called European Values Think-Tank, released a supposedly damning report about RT, criticizing over 2,300 experts who shared their views on the channel The institute, which receives funding from the US and other Western governments, called RT s guests useful idiots, to borrow from a famous quote from Communist leader Vladimir Lenin  Ironically, the list included the names of many figures known as harsh critics of Russia, including Republican Senator John McCain; film director Rob Reiner, a member of the Committee to Investigate Russia; and even former First Lady Michelle Obama  RT:What do you make of this report? Are our guests useful idiots, in your opinion? Daniel McAdams:I was looking through the list of guests who are""Russian dupes""and I see Dick Cheney, I see Joe Lieberman, I see Lindsey Graham, I see Michael Morell So, the Russians agents are at very top of the US government  Even the leading anti-Russia figures are in fact Russian agents  I think we must hide under our beds because it is terrifying  But I would say more seriously, what this is [it s] an attempt to stifle any views that go outside the accepted US neocon foreign policy of intervention  It is ironic that it is a Czech think tank doing this  This well may have come out from the old StB the old Czechoslovakian intelligence service, which did its best to keep Czechs from hearing any kind of foreign policy information that deviated from their own government s communist line  This sounds a lot like that  RT:Do you think some guests might be deterred from appearing on RT? DM: I think that is the intent  Let s look at this: the reason I made a point of it earlier on the guests they had this is not designed to inform individuals; this is not designed to inform it is designed to propagandize, it is designed to intimidate; it is designed to isolate  I am certainly not here to defend RT  I am not here to defend Russia  What I am here to defend, though, is the marketplace of ideas  RT provides a platform for individuals who do not buy into the neocon US foreign policy line to have a voice  I have never been asked at RT what I am going to say beforehand  Any time I ve gone on the mainstream media, or attempted to, I have a long, sometimes 20- or 30-minute, interview beforehand, and often I am told my comments are not needed  So, what we need in a free society is a marketplace of ideas that you maybe disagree with, but you should have the right to hear  How ironic that the United States government is funding an organization that is restricting the Americans ability to hear different views outside the US government view  RT:You're a regular guest on RT  How do you feel about being described in the report as a ""useful idiot""? Annie Machon:I think we should wear it as a badge of honor, because it shows that there is a group of people out there, who are not afraid to challenge the Western consensus perhaps we should have a club, who knows  I would say, though, more seriously, that I have been appearing on mainstream media news outlets for the last 20 years around the planet, and my perspective, my stance has remained absolutely resolute and absolutely the same  I have the same respective, same opinions on all sorts of different outlets  And it is only when I appear on RT that apparently I am now deemed to be a useful idiot  I would also say, as well, that RT is one of the very few TV channels that, when it invites me on to do an interview, they do not insist on a pre-interview to censor and vet what I might be about to say  Many other TV channels do, because they are scared and they want to make sure that they are in control of what their guests are saying  Yet, I still appear on many other TV channels  Perhaps what I am saying is not being Putin s useful idiot, perhaps it is just an alternative perspective that people need to hear  RT:The report says our guests ""undermine Western democracy"" and ""pollute the information space "" Is that what you're up to when you're on the air with us? AM:Absolutely not  I am trying to put forward my perspective, my opinions, based on 25 years of expertise within certain fields, and I feel I do that professionally  Obviously other news outlets feel I do it professionally too, because I get re-invited back to all of those, too  So, it is just a case of freedom of expression  Propaganda campaign by European Values :Paul Vallely, retired US army general RT:Your name is among those on the list  How do you feel about being described in the report as a useful idiot ? Paul Vallely:It seems like a propaganda campaign by European Values, whatever European values means today  I was with Fox News for eight years  I probably have done many thousands of shows and interviews on national security, military and so on, but I ve never been called a useful idiot  I am sure they wouldn t bring me back on if I was an idiot  It s ridiculous  The worst of Times: Establishment paper keeps up attack on RT over London tube ads httPS: //t co/6YyUcU8uHV RT:Why is there so much Western governmental pressure on RT right now? Paul Vallely:I think it goes back to this whole conundrum that s been developed in the US as the result of our election trying to blame Russia for everything, when there is nothing, no factual information that has come out at all  It is being reversed now whether they re looking at the Clinton Foundation and their collusion with the Iranian report, Uranium One  But I think all of this from the press standpoint it is a way for them to attack Russia all the time, always for the most case unfounded the same thing with US politicians attacking Russia  I have researched all of these cases, and I have seen no collusion; I have seen no developmental things by the Russian government or Putin to attack Europe, their leaders, or President Trump  All this is very unfounded and unnecessary  RT:The think tank that published the report is sponsored by, among others, the US Embassy in the Czech Republic  Does that expose it to the charge of bias? PV:It probably does  Especially if you put George Soros s name up there, which is very anti-American, very anti-Trump certainly not loved by anybody in Europe; but anything they fund seems to be targeted on bringing down governments and attacking even legitimate governments  ",https://www.rt.com/news/407424-rt-guests-report-intimidation/
"21 Oct, 2017", Useful idiots? George Soros Prague lobbyists direct their fire at RT guests,"A lobby group, funded by George Soros and EU and US governments, has smeared 2,327 prominent guests of RT as ""useful idiots "" This amounts to a McCarthyite assault on free speech in the media space  Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv What do Harrison Ford, Evander Holyfield, Mr T, Will I Am, Oliver Stone, Stephen Fry and Vivienne Westwood all have in common? Aside from being really famous, they are also united by the fact they ve appeared on RT  And Monika Richter, an obsessive at a Czech-based pressure group called European Values Think-Tank, purports to have compiled a list of all the leading western celebrities, journalists, commentators, academics and politicians who have featured on this network s programmes in recent years  Something which you might think would come in handy, going forward, for new RT producers looking for potential guests, as it contains 2,327 names  Except, alas, it s not really very accurate  The haphazard, careless and shoddy compilation makes some bizarre mistakes, such as confusing British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for an actor impersonating him  And, even more bizarrely, mistaking the legendary Larry King for the equally illustrious Larry David  Not once, but dozens of times Badly implemented smear campaigns from various anti-Russia lobbyists are nothing new  But this attempt is especially inept  Because it s so pockmarked with mistakes that it looks like it was knocked out in a weekend  Which makes its opening suggestion on how politicians and media organisations should publiclly (sic) commit to a higher degree of fact-checking rigour all the more remarkable in its speciousness  Before going further, let s be clear about who pays for the activities of European Values and whoseintereststhis faux-academic concern serves  In 2015, its biggest single source of private funding was the veteran billionairevulture-capitalistGeorge Soros (around 25% in total via two Open Society Foundation agencies)  In Russia, the organization is considered so toxic that it has been banned as a security threat  Furthermore, this viewpoint is not restricted to Moscow, as the government of his homeland, Hungary, has singled Soros out as an enemy of the state  Indeed, even Israel concurs with this view, with its Foreign Ministry saying he continuously undermines Israel s democratically elected governments  So, we know Soros is no friend of democracy  Instead, he uses his vast fortune to interfere in sovereign states and undermine administrations he dislikes  Which is ironically what Richter accuses RT of doing when she writes how RT s raison d Ãªtre is to denigrate the West at all costs and undermine public confidence in the viability of liberal democracy  Something which is completely untrue, given that the actual rationale behind RT is to present Russia s point of view  Also, as it happens, Moscow has excellent relations with many other democracies including South Korea, India and Israel  And is also on friendly terms with numerous individual European Union states even if, under pro-American leaders in Berlin and Paris, the collective has effectively outsourced its foreign policy to the United States in recent years, rendering it automatically anti-Russian  Incidentally, aside from Soros, the other big donors to the European Values lobby group are the European Commission and Parliament and the embassies of the United States and the United Kingdom  Thus, it doesn t take a genius to follow the money and see the agendas at play  And it s instructive that Richter is alsoconnectedto the Atlantic Council, a large US political action body,bankrolledby the Ukrainian World Congress, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Raytheon Company andthe US State Department  All entities that, of course, benefit from strained relations between Russia and the west  Most of Richter s key claims make little sense  She keeps accusing RT of disinformation but provides no evidence of it being deliberate, merely highlighting a few factual mistakes over the years which are no more extraordinary than those of rival outlets  Because there is no news organization that never gets it wrong  The author also cites the US intelligence report on Russian electoral interference,""a laughably misinformed document that has been dismissed by every credible western Russian expert  And she continuously refers to guests as useful idiots;""an incredible insult to fling at giants such as Kofi Annan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Peter Sutherland, Jeremy Corbyn and Wolfgang Ischinger, who have achieved far more in life than the author ever will, on this evidence  European Values other big reveal is that RT uses guest appearances by Western politicians, journalists and writers, academics, and other influential public personalities to boost its credibility  Which is actually not strictly true  In reality RT, like all other TV stations, mainly does it to boost ratings, because, quite obviously, viewers would rather watch, say, Noam Chomsky (listed as Noah here in yet another error) opine on world affairs than some nobody who thinks the US government is beyond criticism  Additionally, Richter accuses RT of anti-Westernism (particularly anti-Americanism)  Which makes one wonder how she d describe American media coverage of Russia, if she were being truly honest  The lobbyist then makes an astounding statement: RT never reports about Russia only about the failings and hypocrisies of Western society  Which is a complete lie, and if you doubt that, clickmy pictureon the top left of this page and you will see that the vast majority of my own writing on here is Russia-centric  Richter contradicts herself all over the shop  For instance, she claims RT s impact on western audiences is minimal to modest, yet, a few lines later she warns how RT's specific effects on its viewers should be a research priority for all organizations and governments interested in countering the Kremlin s disinformation campaign  And later she thunders that Russia s disinformation campaign, which allegedly includes RT s journalism, presents a security hazard that should not be taken lightly but then says it's imperative not to overinflate the threat of RT  Of course, the real agenda behind reports of this nature is often exposed by what they omit  And on Saturday, the Prague-based journalist Michael Colborne (who himself has written for Soros-backed blogs) pointed out that the 52-page slander fest was full of qualifiers and also some arbitrariness with only persons deemed of sufficient public significance and repute are(sic)included "" This might explain why there s a few names missing, including two friends of European Values, who themselves have been on RT! he added  Colborne wasreferringto Julia Davis and Eric Garland, who are today known as particularly determined anti-Russiaactivists, prominent on social media, with perspectives which conveniently mirror the lobby groups agenda  This is just intellectually dishonest horseshit  Framing every single person ever on RT as an idiot except your friends,

"20 Oct, 2017","NGO publishes names of 2,300+ RT guests, labels them useful idiots who undermine Western democracy ","An NGO called the European Values Think-Tank has published a report on RT featuring an extensive list of US and European public figures who have been accused of undermining western democracy just by appearing in RT shows  The report, claiming to be an overview of RT s editorial strategy and evidence of impact, comeswith an Excel list of 2,327 people who have appeared on RT over the last four years  The names are carefully arranged in seven categories, including US politicians, UK politicians, European politicians and so on, and are arranged in alphabetical order  The list mentions the shows the guests appeared on, the total number of their appearances, and gives hyperlinks to all the relevant episodes  The report states that appearing on the network is counterproductive and makes the guest a useful idiot to a hostile foreign power  Expressing one s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to complicity with the Russian propaganda machine  Although the list looks like a really thorough effort at cataloguing all of the RT guests, it s got a number of strikingly weird blunders  For example, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is there, but only the link attached leads to a satirical show featuring someone impersonating him  Meanwhile, US Senator John McCain s daughter is mistaken for the senator himself and Politicking with Larry King is unexpectedly referred to as Politicking with Larry David  Thereportgenerally claims that RT is an instrument of hostile foreign influence, which has the sole purpose of undermining public confidence in the viability of liberal democracy  It repeatedly discourages any public figures from potentially appearing on any of RT s shows in the future, as those on the list are accused of boosting RT s credibility as a legitimate news network  The report asserts the opposite in no uncertain terms  It constantly describes RT as the Kremlin s mouthpiece tasked with no less than destroying the western civilization and society from within  It does not mince words calling RT a second-rate news network with an abysmal reputation and dubious audience numbers as well as the Russian propaganda machine and a disinformation tool  However, it eventually gets so much enmeshed in its own allegations that it starts to contradict itself  The paper claims that RT s influence on its western audiences ranges from minimal to modest, yet almost immediately says that the news network s specific effects on its viewers should be a research priority for all organizations and governments interested in countering the Kremlin s disinformation campaign  It further says that Russia s disinformation campaign, which includes RT s activities, poses a security hazard that should not be taken lightly, and adds at the same time that it is imperative not to overinflate the threat of RT  The report was prepared by Monika Richter, who is described as an analyst at the European Values Think-Tank who works specifically for the Kremlin Watch Program a project aimed at exposing and confronting instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against Western democracies  Richter alsocooperateswith the Atlantic Council a US-based think tank, which is known for its staunch anti-Russian stance  The European Values Think-Tank was founded as an NGO in 2005 and is located in the Czech Republic  It claims to be a neutral, not-for-profit organization aimed at defending democracy and not linked to any political force  However, its annual reportrevealsthat one-quarter of its funding comes from various governmental actors, including the US and the UK embassies, the Czech government and several EU structures, such as the European Parliament and the European Commission as well as their subordinate bodies  According to the same report, the NGO receives most of its funding from a large number of private donors  Its biggest single donor are two George Soros Open Society Foundation agencies, which cover almost 25 percent of its funding  George Barda, an environmental activist and social justice campaigner, called the report disappointing and a piece of propaganda  The reality is that dissident voices in the UK only rarely get into the mainstream media and RT has been the only news network providing a regular platform for them  Much of this report is incredibly disappointing and it is clearly not even pretending to give any kind of serious consideration to the other side of the argument  It is a fairly standard piece of propaganda, he said  Do the author of this report and the politicians in the UK and the US really think that [such people] as Robert Kennedy Jr , Yanis Varoufakis, the former Foreign Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, or the former mayor of London are just idiots ? Afshin Rattansi, the host of RT s Going Underground show said  Of course, they are not and this is incredibly insulting, he said, calling the report a McCarthy atavism  He went on to say that the supporters of the anti-Russian campaign first criticize Moscow for allegedly censoring journalists and then suggest doing exactly the same in the West, thus revealing the inconsistency in their own views  Rattansi also drew attention to the fact that RT s activities have always been in line with the regulations of the UK media watchdog, Ofcom, as the news network has never been fined for any violations  So, it is only the politicians, who clearly do not want some voices being expressed publicly, who see some issues with RT, he added  Luzi Stamm, an MP from the Swiss People s Party, said that a smear campaign that the western elites wage against Russia and RT is just a part of a bigger crackdown against the dissenting voices inside Europe and the US  This recent development in Europe is relatively dangerous, he told RT, adding that the campaign against political dissent in Europe is becoming increasingly more aggressive and one of the games they [the western elites] are playing is destroying the reputation of the politicians they do not like  ",https://www.rt.com/news/407347-rt-guests-list-ngo/

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence-free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of color revolutions around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago  October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago  It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first color revolution, a technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones  According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed  There is just one problem  None of it is true  The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned from Communism and despoiled in the process  Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed  After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi-NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means  US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed the creation of the 'Democratic Opposition of Serbia' (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats  The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits  Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild-mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election  Meanwhile, a student movement called 'Otpor' (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US-trained activists, like Srda Popovic  Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience  ""Suitcases of cash smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t-shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo  Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self-appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission  After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5  Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election  After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum  As a result, Äindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist expediency  Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre- or post-electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority  Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re-branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things  None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned  They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere  Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 'Rose Revolution' in Georgia, installing in power the US-educated Mikhail Saakashvili  This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption  He later joined the US-backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story  In 2004, the US sponsored the 'Orange Revolution' in Kiev, backing a DOS-like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko  By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved  ""US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev,""ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus  The operation - engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience - is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people's elections,""wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000  A decade later, 'color revolution' techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass  The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp  But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world  In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target  A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s 'Arab Spring' uprisings  Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise  While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term  That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience  Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences - there is always the next revolution to plan and execute  And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom  They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator (there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems  Before the dust from the 'revolution' clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos  If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters  While the 'color revolutions' are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics  Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse  Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/
"5 Jun, 2017","If George Soros is the answer to the EU crisis, what on earth is the question?","Just as a stopped clock is right twice a day, George Soros, a man who s done more to destabilize countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis  Mr  Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1  It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet  He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars  Where Mr  Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent  Soros-funded groups are only network following mafia ways in Hungary OrbanhttPS: //t co/NPoXZlq4e3pic twitter com/CsQoLf1Sle The truth of the matter is that the Soviet Union liberated Europe from fascism, that without the inordinate tenacity and sacrifice of the Soviet Russian people and the Red Army, Hitler would have succeeded in colonizing the continent  As US historian Peter Kuznick writes, Up to [D-Day, June 1944], the Soviet Union had almost singlehandedly battled the German military  Until the invasion of Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten  Germany lost over 6 million men on the Eastern Front and approximately one million on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean  Returning to Mr  Soros speech we are regaled with the assertion that the EU is surrounded by hostile powers Putin s Russia, Erdogan s Turkey, Sisi s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can t  Here again, the billionaire investor is guilty of peddling a convenient inversion of the truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr  Soros, also happens to be a member  It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU  In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute  READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: 'Russia's surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr  Soros is right to point out that if the European Union carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement  That is why the European Union needs to be radically reinvented  The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades  It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self-evident detriment of millions of working people  It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period  George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process  European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with  However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens  It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short-term investment as and where the opportunity arises  It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08  The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti-politics or to be more specific anti-politics-as-usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year  European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron  It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991  Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e  Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them  George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU  On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem  Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward

Because the'rag'told us Russian lives are tough and thankless  The hypothesis appears to have been based on a short video clip, featuring one of the better writers on this beat  Let s be clear here, in post-Soviet Russia, some cities and regions have flourished, and others have languished  For instance, you couldn t venture to Tyumen, Krasnodar or Vladivostok and not be impressed by the scale of the improvements  However, a lot of places are standing still, or getting worse  And this is particularly problematic in eastern Siberia and the Far East, where remote geography leads to high prices and a lack of inward investment  Furthermore, the harsh climatic conditions lend themselves to exaggerated gloom  Thus, presenting a perfect backdrop to portray hardship  Nevertheless, to suggest folk are enduring tough and thankless lives is extraordinarily obnoxious  And you can only imagine the Guardian s outrage if a Russian newspaper ventured to bleak British northern outposts like Blackpool, Sunderland or Oldham and used the same language to describe their inhabitants? It'd be akin to the Olympics for offended, scandalized and infuriated liberal commentators  Yet, as it happens, London has far less of an excuse for its failure to tackle post-industrial decline than Moscow  The United Kingdom didn t suffer what Russia endured in the 1980 s and 1990 s when the entire economic and governmental system collapsed  Also, by comparison to the world's largest nation, England is a tiny country where residents of hollowed-out towns can commute to alternative employment centers  Correlatively, in the case of Irkutsk the nearest big city, Krasnoyarsk is 1,062 km away by road  Which is greater than the straight-line distance from Land's End to John o' Groats  This Guardian report was part of a series it is currently running called The Putin Paradox , which allegedly seeks to discover how someone so reviled in the West has been so successful at home  To find the answer, they ve engaged a lady who wrote a book aboutpost-SovietUkraine, another from a George Soroscut-out, and Ukraine sForeign Minister  Which is a bit like asking Manchester City supporters to evaluate the career of United legend Alex Ferguson  Yet, they do allow one voice semi-sympathetic to Putin s achievements, that ofAnne Garrels, a former National Public Radio correspondent, who has spent considerable time in Chelyabinsk  As it happens, the Guardian has so far failed to critique the""liberal opposition""the paper has championed for years  A strange bunch of activists who seem more focused on receiving positive mentions in the English-language press than winning the support of actual Russian voters  And who's central policy platform appears to be telling Russians that everything about their country is awful? Thus, seeing as the Guardian can t be bothered to offer much balance in its project, let s answer the question here  By briefly offering a few reasons why Vladimir Putin is broadly supported by Russians  READ MORE: Can Britain and Russia be friends again? For instance, Russian life expectancy, which had cratered in the late-Soviet period, and during the catastrophic liberal and democratic nineties, has rebounded impressively in the Putin-era  Men now live almost eight years longer than in 2005, and the overall average is close to 72 years  Meanwhile, over the same period, infant mortality has declined from 10 2 to 5 1, per 1,000 births  Incidentally, this is now lower than theUS rate  Meanwhile, the number of medical facilities that provide high-tech health care has jumped from 90 to 932 and,accordingto state statistics, over the past two years, in 2015 and 2016, the number of foreign patients coming to Russia for treatment at Russian clinics has surged by 87 percent to exceed 13,500 in 2016  Furthermore, despite the nasty recession of recent years, Russiawagesare far higher - by all measures - than in 1999, and unemployment remains low  Especially when compared to most of the rest of Europe  Putin has also overseen a restoration of national pride  From the successful Sochi Olympics to winning the right to host World Cup 2018  Also, despite Western anger at the annexation/reabsorption ofCrimea, it has gone down very well domestically, with 88 percent of Russians supporting the move, according to pollster s Levada  This is often cited as revenge for how the West took advantage of a crippled post-Soviet Russia to push its sphere of influence up to the country s borders  Does anything good ever happen in Russia?

"15 Feb, 2017",Munich Security Report: Here comes the apocalypse,"In advance of the 2017 Munich Security Conference (MSC) the organizers have published a report with the subheading Post Truth, Post West, Post Order? The question answers itself, though not for reasons Western liberals will likely accept  In the interests of accuracy let us be clear: it is not the West, it is Western liberalism that is in crisis  The two entities are distinct and indeed, as events have and continue to prove, completely antithetical to one another  The first paragraph of theMSC reportreads as if the end of the world is upon us  The world is facing an illiberal moment  Across the West and beyond, illiberal forces are gaining ground  From within, Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal-democratic status quo  From outside, Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order  And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises - with Syria as the prime example  #Assad: US-Russia cooperation could benefit Syria & wider worldhttPS: //t co/G8xOCEeI9B Implied in this statement is the assumption that liberalism, or liberal values, should be considered sacrosanct, the sine qua non of cultural, political, economic and moral virtue, and as such the values according to which every country, society, and people must exist, regardless of cultural, regional, or historical specificities  Therein lies the problem  Despite the carnage, chaos, instability, conflict without end, societal collapse, and economic dislocation that has been wrought in the name of those very sacrosanct liberal values and liberal democracy in recent times, its proponents continue to live in a state of abject denial  Try telling the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Africa, Latin America, who ve seen their countries and societies destroyed in service to liberal democracy, about this illiberal moment they are meant to fear  Try telling the ever and shamefully-increasing number of victims of poverty, lack of education, poor housing, bad or non-existent healthcare provision in Western countries, where liberal values predominate, about them also  And when it comes to Syria, cited in the report as evidence of a security crisis which Western states seem unwilling and unable to effectively tackle, have these people no shame? The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al-Qaeda against the US in 2001  In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al-Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification  Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi-jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself  The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term Western civilization   Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: Donald Trump s comments about NATO being obsolete have caused great uncertainty among America s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe  The European Union is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia  Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality  NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim  It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change i e  in the former Yugoslavia and Libya  It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal-democratic values and norms have wrought  In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests  As George Orwell wrote, War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength  No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe  How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest  But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem  What they describe as a revisionist Russia is really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony  Replace revisionist with strong, and you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017  They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society  Russia s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council  The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/377466-munich-security-trump-russia-eu/
"13 Feb, 2017",Merkel breaking German law & endangering the country OSCE Assembly ex-VP,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has been dominating the German and European political landscape for over a decade  But after years of economic and refugee crises, unpopular decisions, and a growing divide between EU members, Merkel is facing opposition inside her country and across the Atlantic as well  With anti-establishment forces strong across Europe and a new leader in America, how will the German political landscape shape up this year? And with the new president in Germany standing against confrontation with Russia should we be ready for a policy shift? We ask the former vice president of the OSCE Assembly, and former state secretary to Germany s defense minister Willy Wimmer  Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Willy Wimmer, former vice-head of OSCE Assembly, and former State Secretary to Germany's Defence Minister, welcome to the show, it's really great to have you with us  Now, The Federal election to determine the new Chancellor is coming up in September and Angela Merkel s top contender Martin Schulz has promised to turn the vote into a real thrill , positioning himself as a man of the people   With Merkel already under attack for her immigration policies, is Schulz going to destroy her chances for a fourth term? Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany  They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September  That's an inner German situation  There's another situation coming from our West European neighbors  We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade  It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September  SS: Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary - is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies  The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer  Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10-15 years, the Social-Democratic Party no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich  Therefore, it's normal to re-adjust the direction of the Social Democratic Party  SS: Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote   - even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia  Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool  I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it's so interesting that even the German Security Service - Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) - just told the public that there's no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation  So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation  Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse  SS: Germany s vice-chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S  should find common ground - but not at the expense of Europe - what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S -Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There's an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades  They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S -Russian condominium on Europe  When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him  This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War  SS: Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson - after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban  Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation  Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S  President  SS: Yeah  WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well  But, this time, it is unbelievable  In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps  For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S  government and this is not good for our relations with the U S  and not good for our relations with other European countries  You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain  Yes, they celebrate a special relationship - and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities  That is not in our German interest  SS: Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency  Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave - or go head-on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60-70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it - and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic    yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation  We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners  We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can't blame Germans for doing better business than themselves  It's up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such - and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin  That's the reality  SS: Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending - after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance - does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation  NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete  NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance  NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such  What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian-Western border  This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations  NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such - I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population  SS: Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake-up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours  Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders  To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South  When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it's not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it's under control of the U S  or whether it's under the control of the European Union  I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military  When we face today's situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S -led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us  That is the situation since '99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe  Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it    I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago - I think it depends on the U S  how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s  Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale  We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours  SS: Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti-Russian sanctions in place  At the same time, Trump hinted the U S  could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin  If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU - people and the population at all, the don't have any kind of understanding of the sanctions  The sanctions are in place because of the coup-d'etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West  Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There's no reason  We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public  I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment  SS: There s opposition to Russia tie-mending both in Brussels and in Washington  You ve mentioned in a recent interview the war establishment  of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia - and be in generally less hawkish than usual  Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It's what we see in this very moment in the U S   In my opinion, here's one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations - which are possible, and which are in our interests - with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin  That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party - senator McCain and senator Graham - to organise the outbreak of the WWIII  I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what's going on in the U S : it's a battle about war and peace  Trump is peace and McCain is war - and these are the words of the U S  President  SS: While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority-Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy - are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel  President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole  We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries  We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people  I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years  Therefore, we have to re-organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation  That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe  SS: Germany has experienced terrorism first-hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack  However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism - why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service - is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole  But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development - she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015  She didn't put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station  Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles - not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country  We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who's not acting on the basis of our own law  The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" - and this expresses all  SS: One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum - the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him  Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There's the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn't explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn't want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament  We live in a situation where we never lived in before - the German government has to be based on our own laws  When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don't know that they are in the country, of whom we don't know about their names, their background - I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid - we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws  Therefore we have all these security problems  SS: Alright  Mr  Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany's Defense minister, former vice-President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent's security issues and Germany's efforts to tackle them  That's it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough  The nation s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign-backed NGOs operating in the country  The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues  Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³  Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it's great to have you here on our program, welcome  Peter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³:My pleasure, thank you  SS: So, we'll start with the latest:   Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros    I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that  How dangerous are those organisations for your country? PS: Actually, there's a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country - which is a very dangerous approach, because it's not true  There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would've run, so there were no people voting for ""I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me""  People vote on politicians, on political parties  So it's the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous - number one  Number two, you know, there's a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it's not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent  So, that's why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments - then it should be known to the people  SS: Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with 'local groups' despite government's opposition  PS: What we say is that they have to be transparent  People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics - then these people have to know, whom these are representing  That's what we want to know  SS: Well, who are they? PS: We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary  He has a very clear, let's say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn't like our approach, doesn't like our policies  But, it's not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it's the Hungarian people  We find it very anti-democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for  SS: But when George Soros says that more than ever he's going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he's going to go against the government's will  How's that going to play out? PS: He has a very clear intention, that's definitely true, but I think it's an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence  This is what we have heard a lot from the U S , for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country    So, it's a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors - people, persons, businessmen - of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves  SS: If you're saying you're going after NGOs, you can't just go after Soros-funded NGOs, you'll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well  Are you ready to do that? PS: My position is that we have to ensure level-playing field  So, double standards - we don't like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by  Actually, it's    I wouldn't say 'funny' because it's too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non-Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter ""N"" is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations  As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S  foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family - so, actually, I don't think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non-governmental organisation is too much  SS: So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country's foreign policy? PS: I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life - social, political life - of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are  SS: But here's a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros-funded NGOs, before they came to power - so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? PS: Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad - in the U S  and in the UK  But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back - is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things  SS: Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe - do you think with him in the office it's going to be easier for Hungary to ""get rid"" of these Soros-foundation NGOs in your country? PS: What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S  and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points  There were very clear attempts from the U S  to interfere in our internal issues  Just to give you an example, I was given a two-page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S  as a foreign minister  This two-pager contained some measures which the U S  government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship - but, come on! I mean, it's too much, it's interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary  Although our economic and defence-military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad  So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve  SS: We're going to talk about U S -Hungary relationship in just a bit  Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary - how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? PS: What I understand from my colleagues, since I don't supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations  SS: What's the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? PS: Since I'm not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard  SS: I spoke to Ex-president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus   and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe    Why are they still so supportive of this open-door policy? What do you think? PS: I wouldn't speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries - Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015  I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there's no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees  They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there's war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia  So, why the EU carries out this open-door policy? You should ask the high-ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy  It's harming the EU, it's dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe  Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU - we don't even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not   - but if you speak like this, you're going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that 'migration equals terrorism', which you've never said  But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe  SS: I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter-argument - for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested - if I'm correct - a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren't refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy  So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it's a homegrown thing  PS: It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there's a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are - with opening green borders to them, saying 'please come on in', without controlling them - does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome  So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe - but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been 'double societies' or 'parallel societies' constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies  We have to speak about this openly  We think that this 'solution' based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it's totally against common sense  We have to be able to protect ourselves  We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that  SS: So let's talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey  Luxembourg's Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that  Aren't you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? PS: No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior  If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end  So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary - we are a Schengen member-state, so if there's a decision that a number of ex-migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country - number one  Number two it's against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they're going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx  And, number three, it's breaking European regulations  These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling  SS: Just because this ""open door"" policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr  Orban, comes out and says ""bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide"" - I'm thinking, maybe, it's a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a ""national suicide""? PS: There are tricks in that  First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary  Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory  Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand  Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don't oblige    So,   these are tricks, and it's very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don't want it  SS: You've turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren't the only one - there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls    Is this the only way, to put up fences? PS: We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there's a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders - according to regulation  But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally  So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations  We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you're located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours - it even said, 'during opening hours'! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia - so no Schengen member states    There's no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations  You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said ""No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations!"" - then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly  So, it's tragic, I'll say  SS: Are you pro-Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures  What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? PS: We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it's a suicide for the European economy  European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting-sequence and adjusting-type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products  If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses  So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone  That's what we have been working on, and that's why we don't like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you're accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming  SS: You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe's security, especially Germany - is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? PS: Very minimum  The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border - you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it's not true, because we have border-crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country   - of course, respecting the regulations  When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries - Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower  Only three countries  SS: Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary  PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really ""goes against all European"", but he's still willing to take the risk  How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? PS: There's a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not  So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately  Because of European regulations   you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our   perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal  SS: I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump  EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington - do you think Orban's friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary's relations with the EU? PS: I don't think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he's the President of the U S , and I see that there's a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it's not them, it's not liberal Western media, it's not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who's going to be the President of the U S   I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him ""as such a progressive, such a   wonderful, such a smart guy""!, but because it's Donald Trump, now he's bashed in every sentence, which I don't think would be fair and correct  Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it's American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow - but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar   to his position  SS: And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and    I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti-establishment forces, may not win this elections - do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? PS: There's a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it's no wonder - these are challenging times  There's a kind of fight or debate between two camps - sovereignists and federalists  We say - we belong to the sovereignists, of course -that European Union can only be strong if the member-states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels  If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU  All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union  The only question is - how to get there? Our position is that only strong member-states can lead to a strong European Union  SS: My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions - the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy - they don't want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that  Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S , these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe    PS: We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions  We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy  So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn't want to break the European unity - but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re-evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions  So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S  and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well  SS: Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview  Good luck with everything  PS: Thank you  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/
"25 Jan, 2017",RT critics admit promotion of Russian media threat is a money racket,"Regular readers of RT Editorial will know this column has provided evidence of how think tanks, which are increasingly indivisible from lobby groups, faithfully promote the specific agendas of their paymasters regardless of their stated high-minded missions  When it comes to Russia, most of these faux-academic concerns have primarily concerned themselves with whipping up hysteria about a supposed imminent military danger to Eastern Europe  Shocker: almost all of them arefundedby weapon manufacturers and entities like the US Department of Defense  In other words, the very people who need a bogeyman to justify heightened armed forces spending  However, convincing the general public that Moscow is going to overrun Europe has always been a hard sell  Mainly because Russia is not the USSR and its military spending is much smaller compared to NATO  For example, the Kremlin s 2017defense budgetis around $45 billion  This compares to the $622 billion Washington hasprojectedfor the coming year  That does not include all the other NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, which recentlysigneda $125 billion contract with General Atomics, just for the supply of drones  Probably aware they needed a new schtick, in recent years, bodies like The Atlantic Council and the Center For European Policy Analysis have expanded messaging about the supposed Russian threat to the long-reigning mainstream media consensus  RT is, of course, the favorite target and scary monster  As a result, we see a kind of schizophrenic discourse where the network oscillates from being a huge danger to something nobody watches (but still is a cause for a cash call), depending on which agenda they are pushing on a given day  With this in mind, it was interesting to note Monday s Guardianpiece, headlined EU escalates its campaign against Russian propaganda, for two reasons  Firstly, because the newspaper apparently couldn t think of an example of Russian propaganda in an article about Russian propaganda and instead used a story promoted by an American website, to illustrate the purported Russian threat: In recent weeks the unit (Stratcom East, an EU outfit dedicated to watching Russian news services) has been correcting a widely shared and entirely false story that claimed that a 1,000-strong mob chanting Allahu Akbar burned down Germany s oldest church, they wrote  This storyappearedon Breitbart, which is based in Los Angeles and is 100 percent American owned  Then they followed up, with EU officials estimate that Russia spends $1bn ( £801m) on state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik   Quite why the EU needs to guess is beyond rational understanding, given how RT is transparent about its financing, which amounts to around $300 million this year, or less than a third of that appraisal  Not just that, but all media funding by the Russian state is widely publicized every year, and even adding up the RT and Sputnik budgets still amount to much less than half of the reported figure  So much for the MSM s war on fake news  Just as the EU increased the strength of its Stratcom East annex from eleven staff to 19, and lobbed another ¬800,000 in its direction (because nearly $800 million for BBG and £289 million supplementary Defense & Security funding for BBC World Service clearly weren t enough, not to mention the financial support for the likes of DW, France24, and Euronews to continue fighting the good fight), came a most enlightening conversation between a group of media experts, specializing in the post-Soviet space  The event washostedby n-ost, a German advocacy group, funded by Washington s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which has earned a bit of a reputation forpromoting regime change in countries independent of US foreign policy  The chat concerned whether articles about Russian propaganda now are more widely read than Russian 'propaganda itself  Right now, you can take Russian propaganda to mean anything which offers an alternative view to the mainstream media consensus  At the roundtable were an interesting bunch of folk  Alexey Kovalev, formerly of RIA Novosti, was joined by Vladimir Soloviev of Moldova s Newsmaker, which gets its cash from the European Endowment For Democracy (the EU s version of NED) and Gemma PÃ¶rzgen, a board member of Reporters Without Borders, a concern funded by George Soros, NED and the EU Commission  As they spoke, our heroes seemed to realize how ridiculous the whole hysteria against Russian media has become  PÃ¶rzgen admitted that in the case of Germany, for example, I think the problem is grossly exaggerated  Some so-called 'experts' have blown it up out of all proportion  There s a lack of proper research on the subject that could provide an objective view  There s a lot of propaganda around propaganda if you see what I mean  Meanwhile, Kovalev conceded that (in Russia) state TV channel budgets, both domestic and international, are being cut, projects are being wound down and so on  It was toward the end of the discussion when things got fascinating when in this warm, relaxed echo-chamber atmosphere the brave info-warriors let it slip that their entire mission is essentially a money racket  Take Kovalev: the battle with Russian propaganda has already turned into a fully-fledged industry in which many people, including myself, have had successful careers  It would be stupid to give them up because of the negligibility of our field of study  That s one reason  Soloviev: I also see it as an industry, with budgets that need to be spent  In Moldova, the subject is a best seller on the internal political market  In 2015 the current Mayor of Chisinau (and deputy chair of the right-wing Liberal Party) won his third election thanks to the fact that he spent most of his election campaign fighting Russian tanks  But there s nothing new about the city looking like the site of some kind of urban warfare  PÃ¶rzgen: You re right there, Alexey  There are so many people in the market who used to cover security issues and have now lost their jobs  But now they ve seen the chance to get back into business  There are also lobbying groups such as the Atlantic Council, who have started running conferences all over Europe on the same subject: The rising influence of Russian propaganda  And with that, you could have dropped the metaphorical mic  Because the same people who benefit, via funding for their projects, from stoking the fears of Russian domination of the information space, are acknowledging that it's fundamentally a gravy train  All aboard!

"22 Jan, 2017",Trump s old friends become allies goal refers to Russia Virginia state senator,"Trump s intention is to end the provocative actions that the US took against Russia and normalize relations, Virginia State Senator Richard Black said, adding that this is a great time to draw back from war, unnecessary conflict, and regime change  Donald Trump's first full day as US president saw thousands marching in Washington, DC as a part ofthe Women s March  So-called sister events were held across the globe  Organizers said they wanted to send Trump a message that women's rights are human rights  This followed violent and destructive protests that erupted across the US after Trump s inauguration  In Portland, Oregon, demonstrators burned American flags  Other major cities saw violent clashes with police  RT:Were you surprised by these pretty much unprecedented protests? Richard Black:I am not surprised at all  There are people like George Soros who pay a great deal of money; I understand that many of these protesters have been paid $1,500 to $2,500 to attend  Most of the ones that I saw at the inauguration lacked energy, lacked passion    This is all just theatrics and it doesn t mean anything  RT:Why do you think people are feeling anger that Donald Trump is now the president? RB:The Trump administration may bring about more dramatic change than we have ever seen in our lifetimes  And a great deal of that is going to be in the area of foreign policy  And I think that you are seeing some Republicans who are very nervous about what is going to happen, because he will fundamentally alter our foreign policy  RT:Do you think Trump can unify the country? In his speech, he certainly thought he could  RB:He will do that  We are still transitioning from the campaign, but there s sort of a majesty that surrounds the presidency and very shortly you ll see some of these other things fading away  They can only pay the protesters to be out there for so long  Interestingly, I looked at all of the protesters, almost all of them were white  There were very few Hispanics, Blacks  A very narrow group of people, and somehow they didn t strike me as very genuine  Gilbert Doctorow, the European Coordinator of The American Committee for East-West Accord, commented on the post-inauguration protests in the US: I d like to put this into context; the opposition to Trump is of two varieties: one is what you are seeing in the streets  I would call that opposition from below kind of film extras they are making a lot of noise and catching the TV cameras, but they are not really any threat to Trump s presidency  But there is another type of opposition which is coming from above, which is of vital importance and existential threat to the Trump presidency    In Capitol Hill, there is a different type of opposition, and they are the ones to watch  RT:Donald Trump set himself a big task; hesaidhe wants to do a certain amount of things within 100 days  Do you think the expectations will be too great to start producing results quickly? RB:I don t think so  I think he can move quickly  He has already changed the presidential website  And he has changed the priorities for foreign affairs  It is interesting looking at some of the words: he said he wants more peace for the world, less conflict  He wants to find more common ground  His top priority is fighting ISIS and other terrorist groups  And he talked about joint military operations which, I presume, would mean alongside Russia  He wants to cut off funding for terrorist groups  Interestingly, he says he wants to embrace diplomacy  He says we do not go abroad in search of enemies  He said we are happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies  When he makes that reference to old friends becoming allies, I think he is referring specifically to Russia, which was our ally in the Second World War  And I think if you look at everything that he has said, I think it is his intention to end the provocative actions that we have been taking towards Russia, to normalize relations  I think this is a tremendous time  It is a time when we can draw back from war and unnecessary conflict, from regime change  He obviously has contempt for the old policy of regime change  So, I think it is a very hopeful time  RT:Can Trump create alliances with Iran and China? Because the rhetoric has been different from that [regarding] Russia    RB:It has been, and I think to some extent, we are going have to see how that plays out  I hope that there can be some normalization  The relations with China relate a great deal to our trading balance  And I think we are going to see a very tough position with China dealing with the trading balance  He is determined to return jobs to the US that have been sent overseas  So, there will be some inevitable tensions there  Iran is very much a mystery because there are some signals that perhaps we can cooperate at some level  But I think that remains to be seen exactly where we head with Iran  Obviously, he wants to stabilize Syria, he wants the Assad regime to remain in power  He wants the terrorists out    ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/374694-trump-president-policies-protests-russia/
"19 Jan, 2017", Stop Operation Soros movement begins in Macedonia,"A new initiative, Stop Operation Soros (SOS), dedicated to countering the influence of American billionaire activist George Soros, has been launched in Macedonia  In a press conference on Tuesday, the founders of the group called on all free-minded citizens, regardless of ethnicity or religion, to join them in the fight against one-mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by George Soros, the Vecer newspaper reported  The movement says it will first focus on uncovering subversive activities by Soros-funded NGOs  According to Nikola Srbov, a columnist for pro-government news portal Kurir and co-founder of SOS, Soros-funded NGOs have monopolized civil society in Macedonia and used their position to suppress dissenting views  We've witnessed the takeover of the entire civil sector and its abuse and instrumentalization to meet the goals of one political party  That is unacceptable and goes beyond the principles of civic organizing, Srbovsaidat the press conference  The Open Society Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, used its funding and personnel to support violent processes in Macedonia  It has monopolized the civil society sector, pushing outside any organization which disagrees with the Soros ideology, he stated  Another co-founder, Cvetin Cilimanov, editor-in-chief of the state-run MIA news agency, accused Soros s Open Society Foundations of undermining Macedonian sovereignty by working not only with the opposition center-left SDSM party, but also with outside interests  By cooperating with foreign embassies and organizations such as USAID, Cilimanov believes Soros-backed groups have interfered in the political process of Macedonia  This is unacceptable and has largely contributed to a feeling in the public that the traditional relations of partnership Macedonia enjoyed with some countries are being undermined, Cilimanovtoldjournalists  A third founder of the initiative and editor-in-chief of the Republika news portal, Nenad Mircevski, declared that the group would work towards the de-Soros-ization of Macedonia, echoing a speech made by former prime minister and leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party Nikola Gruevski in December  In the speech, Gruevski accused foreign powers and Soros-backed organizations of meddling in Macedonian politics  Opposition figures have expressed concern at the rhetoric used by Gruevski, fearing the start of a crackdown on dissent and advocacy groups  The Open Society Foundation (OSF) was set up by Hungarian-born Soros between the mid-1980s to early 1990s with the stated aim of helping former Eastern bloc countries transition from communism  However, aside from its support for progressive causes such as drug policy reform, the OSF has also been involved in political activities and Soros publically supported the violent overthrow of the legitimately-elected government in Ukraine during the Euromaidan revolution  This has earned him the ire of Russian authorities, which in 2015 banned Soros and his foundations as a threat to national security  Soros and his foundations have come under scrutiny elsewhere as well  In an interview with the internet portal 888 hu in December, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that 2017 would bring about the extrusion of George Soros and the forces symbolized by him  Orban has accused Soros of undermining European borders and values by helping facilitate the flow of refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere  During a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), WikiLeaks Julian Assange also blasted the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, funded by Soros, for focusing exclusively on negative stories about Russia and former Soviet states  ",https://www.rt.com/news/374241-stop-operation-soros-movement-macedonia/

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US-Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia  If there were a 'hero of the year' list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders  Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian-led airstrikes  One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists  When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself - a decision that also took out the approaching enemy  John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko's single act of heroism when he wrote:""I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko  I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future  But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one    Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism  Ð£ Ð²ÑÐ·Ð²Ð°Ð²ÑÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´ ÐÐ°Ð»ÑÐ¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð¹ Ð¾Ð³Ð¾Ð½Ñ Ð½Ð° ÑÐµ Ñ ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÐ° ÐÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ½ÐºÐ¾ Ð´Ð¾Ð¼Ð° Ð¾ÑÑÐ°Ð»Ð°ÑÑ ÐµÑÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð°httPS: //t co/vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that""NATO does not seek confrontation,""and that it is""everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race,""the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever-closer to Russia's borders  However, as Pepe Escobarexplained,""The real measure is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018  This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s "" Putin emphasized that NATO's inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to""respond adequately""to any threat to its national interests  On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue  In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, 'Jamala' (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin  Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II  Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision's rules  Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors:""The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles  We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 - an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them    ""For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!,""Clark concluded  via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is,""In God We Trust "" Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as 'The Satanic Temple (TST) ' ""Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics,""Thranholm wrote ""TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000  One of the group's objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan     Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC  The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ,according to a promotional video  Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from 'God Country':""Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives  A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God   "" Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US-led countries continued with their regime-change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from   war-torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria  Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe's welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms  In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, 'Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants,' that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration  Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad  Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families  Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros' plan will reap positive benefits  via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the""forced migration""caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it:""If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros-funded organizations "" This is cultural- and ethnic-cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi-purpose war one designed to destroy oil-rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states,""Gerrans concluded  The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber - if not outright disastrous - outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance  Following news that Germany's Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy  Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded:""Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it  A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems  And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it  In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII "" His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice  The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign  No more  In a highly controversial move, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping  Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted  In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete  This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness  During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19-year-old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver  However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat  As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony  ""Let s deal with some facts here,""Cunningham continued ""Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years  So much then for claims of Russian state-sponsored doping   Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances  ""Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium    The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance-enhancing drug only in January of this year "" In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances  The US anti-doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims  As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara  Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add 'insult to injury ' As Bryan MacDonaldexplained:""Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov    two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency  The reader will be able to discern the line of 'reasoning' in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone:""Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes  In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov's murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs,""Whitmore tells us ""So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime  It could also turn out to be a harbinger  As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places""all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination  For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries "" In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump's landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back-door machinations  Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania  The idea didn't seem so wild at the time for a ""Clinton coup"" as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306-232), he failed to win the popular vote - reportedly by 2 5 million votes  Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton - in similar fashion to George W  Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court - could steal the White House from Trump  ""This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes,""Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place  And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle - of so-called ""faithless electors""tipping this contest in Clinton s favor  Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton - an unlikely yet possible scenario - Trump went on to formally secure the vote - and the presidency - on December 19  via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything - from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election - on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire  Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor:""Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee  According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times     The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially-designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still-ongoing hacking operations from the air  Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough  It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers  On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war  Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace  Happy New Year!

"19 Dec, 2016",POTUS-picking: Electoral College under intense focus in controversial election year,"The 538 select Americans that will gather at state capitols across the US on Monday, who are expected to officially pick Donald Trump as the 45th US president, are now facing calls by Trump s opponents to disregard the election results  The arcane and often ceremonial institution has received more attention than usual in this controversial presidential election year, when every election process from closed primaries to recounts has received extra scrutiny  The electors are nominated by the political parties in each state and in Washington, DC  Each presidential candidate has their own unique set of potential electors in each of the states  When Americans voted on November 8, they weren t directly voting for the candidates whose names appeared on the ballot, but rather for an elector to go to the Electoral College on December 19 and vote for their candidate  Currently, 306 electors are pledged to vote for Republican President-elect Donald Trump and 232 are pledged to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  Voting is conducted between 9am and 3pm, with the vote expected to be called shortly before 6 pm  There has been much discussion over whether Electoral College members could decline to vote, vote for another candidate, or switch party allegiance after Donald Trump, a Republican candidate who was critically denounced by leading members of his own party throughout the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious  There was also the suggestion that Hillary Clinton s remarkable lead of 2 8 million in the popular vote might affect the outcome of the Electoral College vote  'If Electoral College votes against Trump, US will get worst constitutional crisis in its history' (Op-Edge)httPS: //t co/zXrUFFDmD9pic twitter com/Dg2x7cKlPf There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote according to the results in their states  However, 29 states do have laws stating just that  Despite that fact, no elector has ever been prosecuted for what is referred to as faithless voting  Refusal or failure to vote for the candidates for president and vice-president appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party which nominated the elector constitutes a resignation from the office of elector, his vote shall not be recorded and the remaining electors shall forthwith fill the vacancy, the Michigan law reads  Apart from the state laws, Democrats and others hoping to encourage Republican dissenters to switch their vote or decline to vote have been intensely focused on the Electoral College voters  Here are the top three: In a video lasting just two minutes and 23 seconds, a roster of Hollywood actors that includes Martin Sheen, who played a president in the popular TV series West Wing, appealed to Republican Electoral College members, asking 37 of them not to vote for President-elect Donald Trump  Thirty-seven is the new magic number, as if 37 of Trump s 306 electors do not vote for him, he would have only 269 electoral votes one short of a majority  If that happens, and it is a long shot, and neither Trump nor Clinton receives a majority of the electoral votes then the House of Representatives would decide who becomes president Unite for America, which sponsored the video, appears to be a new Super PAC   a type of independent political action committee that can raise unlimited sums of money, but can t contribute directly to a candidate  Although it has yet to send an account of its disbursement to the Federal Elections Commission, early indicators show that the fund is somehow tied to MoveON org, a Soros-backed Democratic-friendly political fund  According toHarvard professor Larry Lessig, there may be as many as 20 members who are least considering not voting for Trump  The one member who has gone public is Christopher Suprun of Texas, who has said that, since his announcement, he has received email in support, but also death threats  He said he will vote for another Republican because Trump chose to stoke fear and create outrage  Hillary Clinton Has Grounds To Challenge Constitutionality Of Electoral College- Become POTUS, Harvard Expert SayshttPS: //t co/PKLDZIp8Io He also admits there s a chance he could be wrong about Trump  If Donald Trump turns out to be the next Ronald Reagan, great  Maybe history will prove me wrong  I would welcome that  But we won t know if I was right to do this or not until 20 years from now, hetoldHouston Press  I ve made a decision, and it s not necessarily a popular one, but I have to do what I think is right  Several Electoral College electors resigned to avoid casting their votes for Trump, and at least seven more   Democrats in Colorado and Washington State who call themselves the Hamilton Electors will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and cast protest votes for a candidate not named  These Hamilton Electors are planning to try to convince Republican electors to vote for a third candidate in the hope that this may put the Electoral College into deadlock or result a different candidate being elected  Here to elect a president, not a king : Rep  Electoral College voter refuses to back TrumphttPS: //t co/JQiEAQIYbspic twitter com/3BZNdHv6hD Another Texas elector, Art Sisneros, stepped down from his position rather than vote for Trump, but all that did was promote another Trump elector to vote in his place  Electors who are to cast their votes for Trump say that they are being harassed  Michigan Electoral College member Michael Banerian told  RT that he has received hundreds and hundreds of e-mails, Facebook messages, and letters to my home about four or five a day, tweets  And in some messages, unfortunately, there were death wishes and generally angry messages from people who can t accept the results of the US election, he said  Earlier, in interviews with the US media, Banerian claimed that he had received death threats saying I m going to put a bullet in the back of your mouth, and other ill wishes, such as I hope you die or do society a favor and throw yourself in front of a bus  Texas elector Alex Kim, who also says he has received threats, told the US media that he responds with a simple message: You may all go to hell, and I shall go to Texas  Clay Pell, a Democrat Electoral College member from Rhode Island, has led the charge with nine other electors, including one   Republican, who say that the election process has been tarnished by Russian interference and are asking for more information before casting their votes on Monday  This week, he sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper demanding a briefing  The letter has now received 20 signatures  We as electors have a narrow role, but nonetheless it s a role in protecting the integrity of the election, Pell told reporters this week, according to AP  During his year-end press conference at the White House, President Obama blamed the highest levels of the Russian government for hacking the Democratic National Committee and the emails of its chair, John Podesta  Obama said that he had confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin directly""about the matter when meeting with him in China in September  The US leader reportedly told Moscow to cut it out, and apparently, since then, Washington didn t see further tampering of the election process  However, by then, WikiLeaks had already begun publishing the DNC leaks, Obama added, saying that the media wrote about it every day  However, the majority of Americans voters said inlast week s pollthat the leaked information that the Obama administration claims came from cyber-attacks conducted by Russia had no real effect on the election s outcome  ",https://www.rt.com/usa/370702-electoral-college-extreme-focus-trump/

And we could probably just look it online and find who funds them and so on  I imagine they ve got some corporate sponsorship of some kind  What is very interesting is that all the different media outlets in the West pick up each other s stories  When you ask them what are the sources, they say: Well, it came from somebody else  We got it from them, they ve got it from somebody else What they are doing is they are feeding into the 24-hours news feed with these tidbits of political propaganda  The idea that President Putin is sitting down orchestrating refugees sex-attacks in Germany I think that rates a Hmm, don t you?

MS:Well because of his intelligence service background of course he is the KGB man  George H  W  Bush was ex-head of the CIA, nobody said anything about that  The fact is that Vladimir Putin is being presented as this kind of evil Svengali like Fu Manchu, but manipulating everything in Western politics  The fact of the matter is: the Russian President has got an awful a lot to do just managing and running Russia and managing various affairs he needs to deal with  Trying to stick his finger into a US presidential election even if it was possible - is not really a very sensible thing to be claiming  It is just doesn t have any credibility to my mind at all  Clinton blames FBI director &#Russiafor her defeathttPS: //t co/6Rc6dFKxQTpic twitter com/jGoIzbNXgT RT:Nigel Farage had this to say about another recent allegation against Russia - of involvement in Brexit  Is it really hysteria or are these accusations actually based on something?

Jon Gaunt:It s called propaganda simple as that  It would appear that the EU is very unhappy about the fact that Britain democratically decided to get out of the EU  They are unhappy that people in America decided to vote for Trump and not Hillary Clinton  So they start off with these ridiculous stories that Vladimir Putin and the Russians tried to steer the American election  Now we ve got an MP standing up in the mother of all parliaments Ben Bradshaw in London and saying the Russians affected the Brexit decision  Next they will telling us that the Russians are going to come and eat our babies  It s completely and utterly ridiculous  It s stupid, it s base propaganda  And the majority of people in Britain from what I m hearing, when I listen to my listeners on Talk2Me Radio and on other phone-in shows here in the UK the British population is seeing straight through this  This is pure propaganda  The EU needed a new enemy  They ve decided that new enemy is Vladimir Putin and so they are poking him with the biggest stick they can find  And it is frankly ridiculous  #Obama: Reagan would roll over in his grave at GOP support of#PutinhttPS: //t co/1AJHptEKatpic twitter com/MzbqXwzXNf RT:In the UK, it's being reported Vladimir Putin's spies have launched a campaign to target Britain with cyber-attacks  The Russian president is being portrayed as quite the spymaster these days  What do you make of it?

"18 Dec, 2016",Facebook s 'anti-fake news' plan looks like effort to curb alternative media,"There are serious concerns over a social media giant's plans to debunk spurious news stories  And many are puzzled about the real agenda at play  Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv You don t need to worship at the altar of George Orwell to see where this is going  Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as fake news on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content  While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it's proposed to implement it merits many questions  Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country s popular press  But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering  Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook  In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg s firm is an effective monopoly  CIA meddled in hundreds of elections: Ron Paul talks Russia-blaming, fake news and more on RThttPS: //t co/qxttAcpYSmpic twitter com/1kd44g8AVH Whereas papers have always been curated by editors, their power was limited by the sheer number of competitors in every national market  And the more different they were, the better for society in general  However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary  Of course, another big problem here is that one person s fake news could be another s truth  And that s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves  To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self-proclaimed international fact-checking network, which presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity  Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing  They include Pierre Omidyar,George Sorosand Washington s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft-power cutout  As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine s Maidan coup in 2014  Thus, it s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of ministry of truth with only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook s primary news feeds  And this is very dangerous  Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact-checkers to sort out fake news httPS: //t co/jZmZXrpl06pic twitter com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling  Because it s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices  That said, nobody is disputing whether fake news is a problem  It s just hard to find agreement on its definition  For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it's often a different story  Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non-mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked bynumerouscrediblesources  And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging thatVladimir Putinwas using kompromat to destroy the reputations of his political opponents  For'proof'they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography  German politicians want ¬500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrshttPS: //t co/VSGNiA2M98pic twitter com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper's readers were greeted with this soft-soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins: His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K G B  and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K  Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride  And to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes  Yet, sadly for Higgins - and Bukovsky, of course - his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child pornimageshimself, as""research "" Then there s theGuardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth  A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune - without any explanation - suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the sameWashington Post  These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source  And we can t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times  Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of alove childand Moscow developing a Star Trek-esqueteleportation device  Are all these not examples of fake news?

"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro-Clinton supporter  In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton's particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats  Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4-8 years of US-led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms  The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton's War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes,""What's the point of having this superb military    if we can't use it?""And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq - which was half a million dead Iraqi children - was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded,""We think the price is worth it "" Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball:""Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government  But it is already clear that Russia's intervention in our election on Trump's side is the real scandal of 2016    "" Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia's (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the""real scandal""of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange's torturous, slow-drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind-boggling list of 'poor decision-making ' ""The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics,""Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans 'nothing to look at here, please move on ' Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails  This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal  The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton's chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them  Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump's victory chances on Nov 8th  And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous  But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do  With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders  That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC  chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz  The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that  Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton-Trump CNN-hosted debate  The jaw-dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate-style investigation  By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either  But that's mere child's play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group  US Ambassador to Libya J  Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack  In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad  Clinton's leaky emails point to""the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of  ISIS  of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including  ISIS, that s there in those emails,""the WikiLeaks co-founder said ""There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone,""he added  Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration  So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of 'collateral damage' in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked  Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents  Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We'll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr  Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony  In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub  Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body  Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers  Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich - as opposed to Russia - was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr  Rich  ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich  Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as""yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered at dawn as he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails "" Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild ""conspiracy theories,"" yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about""Russian involvement""in the WikiLeaks  Although it may be perfectly true that Mr  Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower  Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence  Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this    Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government the Russians "" When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America's global military footprint if elected president, neo-conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party  Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American-style fascism  Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election  What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals - like George W  Bush and, yes, Barack Obama - who pledge to continue America's wars of expansion and empire  Clinton's past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to""Make America Great Again ""Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools  Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures  Assange sorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t co/6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A  Mussomeli - in the Washington Post, of all places - really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump:""Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al-Assad in Syria, are frightened    But what really troubles them is [Trump's] generally level-headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs     Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep s clothing  just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf s clothing "" Anne Applebaum, perennial anti-Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange's work with groundless accusations:""Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen  Philip Breedlove  and probably others  The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U S  democratic process and, again, the elite who supposedly run it "" Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton  Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum's diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess  Albright claimed that Russia seeks to""undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious ""The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr  Assange, the value of that statement for themselves  So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton's rat-infested ship once and for all  We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again  @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365545-madeleine-albright-clinton-neocon/

America is not some kind of   banana republic , after all, but is a  great power  Do correct me if I  am wrong  Reality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency  Anthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream mediaacknowledginghow Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of philantro-capitalism (actually a money laundering pay to play racket), a practice by no means confined to the Clintons   And the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary beingperfectly awarethat prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh  Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations - all three of them  Exhibit A is  thisWikiLeaks bombshell; Peter Kadzik, who s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton s right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset  Process has begun :#FBIscouring 650k emails on#Clintonaide s laptop in reopened casehttPS: //t co/l6cThxdWv1pic twitter com/oPmgO2WJzI Not only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta as also revealed by WikiLeaks - thanked Kadzik for keeping him out of jail ; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secretheads upon the Clinton email investigation  The Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business  Huma and her family s close connections to Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi)  Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that s part of the Clinton Foundation connection  Yet now, with Huma in the spotlight still maintaining she didn t know all those emails were in her and Wiener s laptop - it s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to one of my aides  She used to beHillary s ersatz daughter ; now she s being framed as The Fall Princess  And that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener s sexting of minors  The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now  Let s try to cut a long story short  Last July, the DOJ under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate  And yet FBI director Comey who nonetheless stressed Hillary s extreme carelessness turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe  Soon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation  The East District of New York refused it  Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch  Enter an extra layer of legalese  Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements  But then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner s sexting of a 15-year-old girl  Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts fromHumaabedin@yahoo comto the crucialhuma@clintonemail com   This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept  emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the secret clintonemail com to Huma at yahoo com  No one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements  What s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined  Now picture both teams of FBI investigators Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener comparing notes  And then they decide Huma s emails are relevant   BREAKING:#PodestaEmails25: WikiLeaks releases latest batch of Clinton emailshttPS: //t co/5Xe0ziOAdFpic twitter com/D8R12iQUFX Key questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed relevant if the investigators could only examine the metadata  What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails a potential game-changer  That s why one of my sourcesinsistshis decision to go public came from above  The other key question now is whether the DOJ via Kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation  Senior, serious FBI agents won t take that massive euphemism kindly  The FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year  Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence and they won t quit  Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton s Bonfire of Scandals problems  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365204-clinton-us-investigation-justice/

co/sqWeSwjg48#UNHR#SaudiArabia#humanrights The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia  Perhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats  That Saudi Arabia widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat,according todocuments released last year by WikiLeaks  A Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes  Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen  It is also welldocumentedthat US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes  That makes these Western states fully complicit  Moscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F-16s bombing of Syrian civilianshttPS: //t co/WzwvworaZdpic twitter com/cHlKvzaeUD Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years,according toa report last week  Britain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, hassoldover $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015  Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots tohelp trainSaudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law  There is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC  The hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void  Importantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications  The information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources  Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by activist groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported rescue workers of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center  BREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into#Aleppo war crimes httPS: //t co/xrdojTxO3vpic twitter com/2gKhTiMovH In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called Free Syria broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat  Free Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy  It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks  Free Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS  Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans  Another regular contributor to the images and reports on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center  Thus, on this publicly available Free Syria channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam  What is even more damning is that the same information is disseminated albeit in a more polished form through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian  It s an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted  Russia s military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state  That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies  And to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies  The utter insanity of it all  But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT

"24 Aug, 2016","Modern Ukraine is 25 yrs old, but is it actually independent?","Ukraine celebrates the 25th anniversary of its succession from the Soviet Union this week  But, after years of struggle and division is it truly independent? Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv March 2014 was arguably the most dramatic and pivotal month in Kiev since Ukraine seceded from the USSR  The country s democratically elected government had been overthrown in a violent coup (considered to be a revolution in the West) and the new regime was struggling for legitimacy  Especially after a leaked phone callbetweenthe US Ambassador Geoff Pyatt, and State Department representative Victoria Nuland, seemed to suggest external actors had dictated its make-up  Adding to the tumult, Crimea had just voted to separate and re-unite with Russia in a hastily organized referendum, (which is regarded as an annexation by much of the West) and Donbass witnessed clashes between pro-Maidan protestors and others who opposed the movement  At this moment, Ukraine was on fire and needed all the support it could muster  Except that backing never came, despite gaggles of Western politicians showing up in Kiev in early 2014 pledging solidarity with activists who sought to remove President Yanukovich  Two and a half years later, Ukraine has received minimal aid from Western countries and is no closer to EU membership than it was then  In fact, even the promised visa-free travel arrangement with Schengen countries has yet to materialize  Sharp analysts have long suggested that Western power brokers aren t that dedicated to helping Ukraine  Instead, the argument goes, the priority seems to be hurting Russia  This week, via a DC Leaks dump of billionaire Hungarian investor George Soros communications; we havenew evidenceto support that argument  What s also interesting is that when Russia ejected Soros NGOs, Western reaction was apoplectic  DC Leaks' revelationssuggestPresident Putin s move to block these groups might have been soundstrategy  On the last day of March in 2014, according to the files, Ambassador Pyatt sat down for breakfast with billionaire Soros and a group of lobbyists he employs to push his agenda inEastern Europe  What is most startling about the conversation is the total lack of regard for Ukrainian interests and the obsessive focus on Russia  It s also instructive as to how Western influencers regard Ukraine  More as a buffer against Moscow than as a country with rightful aspirations of its own  At one stage Pyatt asks Soros, what (the) USG (US government) should be doing and what the USG is currently doing (sic)? The reply is Obama has been too soft on Putin, and he goes on to suggest a division of labor between the US and the EU with the US playing the bad cop role in dealing with the Kremlin  It s all Putin, Putin, Putin and continues in this vein  The only mention of Ukraine is when Pyatt and Soros agree to remove Yulia Timoshenko from the equation  Timoshenko is associated with everything undignified, the ambassador states  Now, we are all entitled to an opinion on Timoshenko  But her political party Fatherland is currently themost popularin Ukraine and it s up to Ukrainians to decide whether she is fit for office, not a bunch of foreigners who have no democratic mandate in the country  After all, Ukraine is supposed to be a sovereign state  But a quarter of a century after modern Ukraine was established, how independent is it really? If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous  What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro-western reformers and pro-Russian kleptocrats  This is hogwash  The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov)  What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power  And for the past two years, they ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory  Something even America s influential Foreign Policy journal nowadmits  There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich  But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West  Furthermore, he's enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse-trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal  That said, Poroshenko is described as pro-Europe and his predecessor as pro-Russia   However, in reality, both men are pro-themselves and pro-money  Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success  The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt  Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems  The central Asians - with the exception of Kazakhstan - have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated  The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova  Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates  They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era  Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago  Let s just look at Ukraine s figures  In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller - in real terms - than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off  After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now  To add insult to injury, it is also the world s mostunequal country  When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling  The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet s most extensive rail systems  A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world s largest plane, the An-225  This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons  Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland  Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now  With that in mind, you d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of Marshall Plan to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming  Because they know the funds would be stolen  Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia  As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States  Thus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money  For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow  As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine s economic collapse is the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor  In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two-thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent  Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal, Petro recently wrote  However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev You see, Ukraine doesn t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia  Except it s not Slovakia s gas, because that country doesn t have any of its own  Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re-sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium  Ukraine's - completely insane - economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs pic twitter com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn t want to admit that it s Russian gas  This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers  Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow  To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an independence day military parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all  Aside from all this, what Poroshenko's regime can t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is  Currently, it s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country  To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world  If Back to the Future s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again, how many would jump right in?

"25 Jun, 2016",More Brussels bureaucracy: Brexit may take up to 10 years to implement ,"The Tory party will drag its heels to leave the EU, says geopolitical analyst Patrick Henningsen  It has already announced that Brexit is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October, followed by a change of leadership as well, he added  US President Barack Obama, who paid a visit to Britain in April urging the country to stay in the EU, was one of the most vocal leaders against Brexit  The White House says it doesn't welcome the results of the UK referendum, but will accept the choice of the British people  RT:Does the US actually lose out in any way because of Brexit? Patrick Henningsen:They do  If you look back at the history of the European Union, the United States in a sort of covert fashion - initially anyway, post WWII - was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the European Union  And that has been learned through declassified documents and those are now publicly available  It is easier for the US to wield its foreign policy agenda by dealing with one central point of contact, rather than 28 odd different states on any major issue  So, certainly Washington would like to see the EU together and its special relationship with Britain makes that process all the easier when Britain has a major seat in Brussels  RT:The US State Department says John Kerry wants to be part of the talks between London and Brussels  But is the Brexit process really any of Washington's business? PH:That is very interesting if that is the case  The reality right now is that the Tory conservative party is dragging its heels on invoking Article 50, which once it is invoked would set in motion a two-year period of exits and then renegotiating Britain s terms and conditions of that exit  They have already announced that it is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October and then the change of leadership as well  David Cameron has already hinted this is something for the next conservative leader to do - be that Boris Johnson or Theresa May  So, they ve already kicked the can down an additional six months  So, we are looking at an exit of a possibly five-year window  Some legal experts say it might be even longer than five years; it could be up to 10 years  We ll see  Remainers now grasping every piece of economic bad news like shipwrecked mariners reaching for flotsam RT:An EU without Britain would arguably make the Union weaker  So would that actually make Europe more dependent on the US? PH:That is an interesting point  I think from the US point of view, militarily this will be a big issue  NATO has already announced that they stand firm with the current set up and current relationship that includes Britain being at a center of NATO  However, talks of an EU military force, which have been going on behind the scenes for quite long time now, these agreements are already in place between many countries, this system of interdependency between various European militaries  So, it would be very interesting to see how that plays out  Certainly, that is something Washington would like to see in the future - an EU defense force deployed in countries  Also, Washington would like to see Turkey possibly as a member of the EU and that would extend the territory right down to the Middle East  So, from the military point of view, from the Pentagon point of view, from defense contracting profit point of view this could be a fantastic market for arms- and defense-related industries  So, that is one of Washington s main interests  Plus, being able to wield its foreign policy through Brussels for sanctions against Russia, for instance, is very important for Washington  Thorsten Polleit, economist and investor, Polleit & Riechert Investment Management told RT: Given the market reaction following the publication of the decision most investors were caught off guard  Most people wouldn t have expected the Brits to leave the EU and that explains a lot why stock markets - and particularly the pound - has gone down so substantially  Overtime there will be a reassessment and in particular the prospects for Great Britain are much brighter than what market reaction tells us   RT:The euro and the pound took big hits  But does that help or hinder the dollar? PH:What we saw is a flight of capital into what they call a perceived safety  People perceive the dollar as a stable haven for investments  So, what you saw the markets reflected exactly that  You saw money transferred into dollar markets and also into gold, into hard money  So, that s expected  In terms of the pound devaluation of the pound at some point is not a bad thing for the British economy  There are a lot of benefits in tourism and also the export benefits as well  Fear mongering before the vote was: The pound is going to free fall   George Soros even laid a veiled threat against the Brexit voters  But that is not altogether a bad thing for Britain  And a devalued pound doesn t hurt its balance of payments at home, paying for domestic services and benefits, which are done domestically anyway  So, I don t think there are major shock waves there  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/348350-uk-eu-us-exit/

Abayomi Azikiwe:Because stations like RT and other media sources outside of the US are getting hundreds of millions of viewers and readers; even inside the US many people are looking outside to get more objective information and analysis  The US media is not a free press; it is a corporate-controlled media  Even the so-called National Public media in the US if you look most of the people who speak in that media come from the corporate sector  They are very concerned about controlling information  It is not unusual that Victoria Nuland would come with a pack of lies  She is quite accustomed to doing that  Remember, this is the same Mrs  Nuland who was    giving away cookies to extremist Ukrainians during the so-called revolt in Ukraine, which had been financed and had been supported by the forces and the money of George Soros and others in order to pull Ukraine away from Russia and create really a pre-war situation in the East    It is not true what Nuland said they have tried for 20 years to get a good relationship with Russia  -William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT RT:US officials continue to talk about so-called Russian aggression    Where is this aggression that Russia poses such a threat to the US AA:They don t clearly spell it out because the US and NATO have Russia surrounded on many fronts: In Europe, in Eastern Europe  That continuing encirclement is spreading to other parts of the world, including Asia and Africa  They have the US-Africa Command  So, it is the US, the State Department, the CIA, NATO these are the military alliances that have more bases than any other country throughout the world and they are in fact escalating aggression against Russia and other countries that don t toe the line of the State Department  RT:Do all these hearings and discussions between American officials on propaganda mean that they are losing this battle? AA:I believe they are  Because particularly among a lot of young people inside the US they are looking for information outside the corporate media  Most of them do not get their news from the major media outlets that are promoted by the corporate interests and by the government  So, they are concerned that you don t have this type of anti-Russian, anti-Chinese, anti-Iranian type of slant to the media orientation  So, when you have people inside the US that are watching RT, and are watching other stations outside the US, this poses a challenge to their control of information and how people view the world  Mrs  Nuland is one of the real perpetrators of this because she has been in it from the get go  And she is taking a personal responsibility in trying to really destroy Russia as a powerful nation  And that is why there is an obsession here that President Putin has reacted and has reacted strongly because he wants to defend the sovereignty of Russia  And therefore the US and people like Nuland - not the entire US, but some of the leadership - are reacting very strongly to this    ""-William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT  RT:Is it possible to repair ties with another country if you are always claiming them to be a threat to you?

"11 May, 2016"," Trump, Clinton equally right-wing warmongering shields of big business ","Americans have to choose between two equally right-wing pro-war candidates, says Jerome White, presidential candidate for the Socialist Equality Party  He says Trump promotes xenophobic, anti-immigrant lines while Clinton s a complete tool of Wall Street  A new report by the Wall Street Journalshowsthat US Democratic Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton received millions of dollars for her campaign from Wall Street  RT:Why does Clinton seem to be the preferred candidate for Wall Street? Jerome White:She has a long record, as did her husband Bill Clinton with very, very close connections to the most powerful financial institutions in the US on Wall Street  Under her husband s administration they deregulated Wall Street; they lifted the Glass Steagall Act, and allowed the immense building-up of the financial bubble that produced the financial collapse of 2008  As the Obama administration carried out the bailout of Wall Street, the Clintons maintained very, very close ties  As we all know, she received hundreds of thousands of dollars - in fact millions of dollars and speaking fees - in the aftermath of the crash  RT:Clinton is also likely to get more contributions now that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have dropped out of the race  Will this have an impact on her stances on issues and, perhaps, presidency? JW:After an entire primary process in which for the first the anger of millions of workers over the social inequality, over the domination of the entire political system by the financial elites was expressed  In the end essentially, what the American people have is a choice between two equally right-wing candidates, two pro-war candidates  On the one hand, a billionaire, who is Donald Trump, who seeks to tap into the social anxiety and channel it along xenophobic and anti-immigrant lines; on the other, complete tool of Wall Street and of the Pentagon  In the end, the [Bernie] Sanders campaign, which tapped into this enormous anger he is now committed to support Hillary Clinton, who he openly criticizes as a tool of Wall Street  But he as a Democrat now is supporting that very same tool of Wall Street  RT:The fact she is supported by big corporations doesn't seem to be harming Clinton's ratings  Don't people care about this?

"8 May, 2016",Russia: The new baddie again,"Each leader the West wants to take down is really the same stock character brought back in slightly different attire after the commercial break; Saddam, Gaddafi and Assad are all the same guy: the archetypal Darth Vader to our Luke Skywalker  Within this simplistic, childlike meta-narrative nothing the baddies do can be good  As those in charge of our propaganda know, the vague, malevolent force which characterizes all our baddies is a much better reason to attack them than anything based in reality  Thus, baddies have no convincing backstory  They are evil because well, just because  And that is precisely why they must be overcome  While the West had other countries to trash, it let Russia slide in and out of various tenuous sub-plots  But now that Western enemies in the Middle East are burning nicely, the script has space for the development of a new central baddie as the prelude to Well, we all know what  One struggles to remember a time when Russia could do anything right in the eyes of Western media  It liked the end of the Cold War and the Yeltsin era when Russia was handing over the nation s wealth to non-Russian interests; a people elbowing each other out of the way in a fight for shiny trinkets that was acceptable  The pre-story to that drama was the deal Gorbachev cut with the US  Under Gorbachev, the USpromisednot to encroach on Russia s sphere of influence a fact now denied by the US, naturally  But at the time it was true, and it gave Russia the confidence it needed to let Communism go and allow personal initiative to find a level  Fast-forward thirty years and NATO is busy fillingPolandwith troops, and claims outrage when Russia monitors its activities in theBaltics  However, when the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to re-join Russia, this result was rejected by Western media as lacking any legitimacy  Russians now get it that in the post-Soviet stage play called 'international politics' anyone with traditional values who doesn t clap wildly when his own side takes a hit will be hissed at while the piano clangs away menacingly in the corner  They understand that talk about fairness, democracy, choice and equality is just that: talk  They have seen how globalism works  And unsurprisingly they aren t interested in much more of it  In a BBC piece purporting to measure attitudes towards what it calls global citizenship , Russia isidentifiedas the most backward country on earth  Feeling like a global citizen (i e  having abandoned all the values your grandfather would have laid his life down to uphold) is assumed by the BBC to be the very definition of virtue  Spain is found to be the country most wholeheartedly throwing itself over the cliff-edge, with what the piece calls an eye-catching majority of 84 percent believing that they should take in more of those fleeing the five-year civil war in Syria  The fallacies are instantly obvious to anyone with a functioning brain: Syria s civil war is entirely the result of sustained attacks by western money and mercenaries, and four out of five refugees arenot from Syria  Syria was slated by the US for what it calls regime change i e  unilaterally going into a country which had done it no harm and committing mass murder in order to hand that country over to the same central-banking system which runs everywhere else  The source for this plan was disclosed by none other than General Wesley Clark  But none of that matters  The main thing is that globalism is super fab, and if you don t want more of it, you re backward and probably deserve theeconomic warwaged against you because you don t roll over in the face of NATO - or Soros-backed aggression  Zbigniew BrzeziÅski that master of how things actually are rather than how we are told to think about them famously said: Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves  They ll only be able to parrot the information they ve been given on the previous night s news  He was right  Western publics are nothing if not malleable  Not only is the ability to reason independently largely absent, people also have little or no memory  And their attitudes towards Russia are no exception  Having spent the last few years in Europe, I am constantly impressed by how immune to either facts or reason the general population is  People will say in all seriousness that Putin is behind the current invasion of Europe repeating theclaimput out there by former NATO chief US General Philip Breedlove, who has been replaced by General Curtis M  Scaparrotti, a man who is busy moving all his pieces into the very spaces on Russia s border the US promised never to occupy  'Resurgent Russia': New hardline#NATOEurope commander raises hackles in MoscowhttPS: //t co/DDNNywPuPHpic twitter com/wrSAxrUwG8 Under Yelstin, Russia was nothing but an economic target; weak and failing, and selling off the family silver for pennies on the dollar while signing wholesale into law legislation handed to it by US NGOs with agendas entirely inimical to those of the Russian people  Yet in the bed-time-story version of events for popular western consumption, Yeltsin was a goodie  Had his successor continued in the same vein allowing foreign interests to asset-strip the country the narrative today, doubtless, would be that Russia is free   I have seen enough of how realpolitik works not to expect anything from any government ever beyond intrusion into my life and the appropriation of a proportion of what I generate  I regard belief in government per se as a sort of weakness  So while I understand westerners who rightly disillusioned by their own countries choose to see Putin as a lone hero fighting a rear-guard action against globalism, I don t exactly share their sentiments  One can t help but have a twinge of envy when looking at Russia s Putin  Firstly, he is both bright and sober  When a journalist asks him a question, he has the ability to answer it well and often with humor  Even given the hopeless translations into English in the media, at least some of what is in the original Russian comes across  Secondly, he is professional  He demonstrates an appropriate CEO-level grasp on his responsibilities  Thirdly, he describes the world and acts within it like a man who regards people in his own country as his principle stakeholders  Whether this is in fact the case is at least in my opinion impossible to tell  But it makes for a refreshing and enjoyable narrative  In the West, we are simply not used to this type of presentation  Given the controlled demolition of Europe, it is clear now to those who retain their natural instincts that those who make the big decisions in Europe are simply acting liketraitors  Thus, at the level of narrative, the Western propaganda machine is left with a thorny plot point to resolve  Since relative to Putin the goodies have made themselves look decidedly Darth-Vadery around the gills, the implication is obvious to anyone who knows how stories work: the Force is now with Putin  This is highly problematic; a narrative meltdown  The confusion and dilution of the villain archetype mid-drama as anyone who has followed Star Wars will know can mean only one thing: that a brand new, conflict-heavy storyline is on its way  @SamGerrans ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/342285-russia-new-baddie-again/
"5 May, 2016",'US spending millions on 'Aleppo is burning' PR campaign to create no bombing zone',"The Syrian conflict involves a public relations war with a level of sophistication we ve never seen before, geopolitical analyst Patrick Henningsen told RT  Russia and the US agreed Wednesday to extend the ceasefire in Syria to Aleppo, the country's second largest city  The Syrian government has accepted the terms of the agreement, with the Syrian Army saying the ceasefire will come into effect on Thursday night and will last for 48 hours  There has been reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] has a so-called Plan B that if the ceasefire fails, if the Geneva talks fail they will dramatically increase their arms supplies to the moderate opposition  That is obviously not a good incentive  It means some moderate opposition people will say: Why do we have this ceasefire? Why do we have these talks? Because we will get better weapons, if everything breaks down  Guardian columnist Jonathan Steele told RT  RT:How much of an effect could the ceasefire, agreed by Moscow and Washington, have on the situation in Aleppo? Patrick Henningsen:I don t think it is really going to change the situation on the ground  I think what you have is a situation where extremist groups call it moderate rebels, or call it terrorist groups they are going to use the ceasefire to buy time to get reinforcements lined up to establish new supply lines that have been damaged by Russian airstrikes over the last couple of months  The problem is that Al-Nusra Front, or Ahrar ash-Sham, or all these terrorist groups that are operating freely in Syria in these rebel held areas they are ubiquitous with the so-called opposition  You can t separate them; this is just a game, this is being played  The US knows this quite well  Meanwhile, the diplomats have to play the diplomatic due process  So they are doing their job, but behind the scenes there is whole other agenda playing out  RT:US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently accused Russia of fueling the civil war by supporting Assad  Could such statements make it more difficult for Russia and the US to work together on the peace effort? PH:Firstly, the US Defense Secretary is using language that doesn t actually apply to this conflict  He is doing this to try to re-frame the narrative  He is calling it a civil war  This is not a civil war by any stretch of the imagination  It ceased being a civil war back in 2011, maybe early 2012, but after that it is anything but a civil war  This is a conflict, it is a proxy war  What you have is the US will do what is called a strategy of confusion in terms of public relations  So John Kerry is the good cop, he is there with Sergey Lavrov trying to hammer out a peace deal in Geneva  And Ash Carter is playing the bad cop he is making inflammatory statements that are trying to characterize Russia as a bad guy  And then President Obama might have another statement that he does, and the State Department spokesman will say something else  This is what the US does constantly; this is their strategy of PR confusion, so that no-one knows exactly where they stand on any of the issues  This is used to basically obscure and cover up what is essentially a dirty war going on the ground in Syria right now  RT:Russia, meanwhile, has said it is not supporting the Assad government  Why would the US object to what Russia is doing? PH:I think it s out of frustration  Russia came in with a very clear objective back in October, 2015 and they achieved that objective by a lot of people s estimation  Then they receded their operation, and they packed up and left a large portion of their military footprint there  This upset everybody because the US was saying that Russia was being dragged into a quagmire  At every turn the narratives that are being conjured up by the State Department are getting knocked down and disintegrating  This is just I believe frustration; this is a PR war  We re looking at a public relations war  The US and George Soros have spent millions of dollars over the last couple of weeks launching Aleppo is burning it is a PR campaign, designed to get people behind a no bombing zone  So the no-fly zone became the safe zone , and now it is a no bombing zone   This is a public relations war with a level of sophistication we ve never seen before  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/341934-syria-tuce-agreement-carter/

"9 Apr, 2016",Why Sitting Bull was right about Washington s lack of integrity,"That integrity is a foreign land where Washington is concerned is an inarguable fact  In the latest example, the failure to complete the construction of a nuclear disposal plant agreed with Russia once again leaves Washington s credibility in tatters  Underlying this issue is the attempt by the US federal government to alter the terms of theagreementit signed with Russia in 2000 for the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium, with each country building industrial plants with this specific objective in mind  Russia has kept its side of the bargain and, at no small cost, built the facility required to dispose of its excess nuclear material in the manner agreed  The US on the other hand is now looking at an alternative method of disposal, which amounts to storing said material in a process that allows it to retain its breakout potential i e  its ability to be converted back into weapons grade plutonium  Not what we agreed on : Processing method swap violates US-Russian plutonium dealhttPS: //t co/kePBWpIv3qpic twitter com/EA3MiCeGWl Given the record of subterfuge and double-dealing on the part of successive US governments when it comes to its failure to honour treaties and agreements, nobody should be surprised  Indeed, this subterfuge is so common where Washington is concerned that you could be forgiven for considering it a quintessentially American trait  Since 2000 alone, the record in this regard makes stark reading  The willfully false assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of WMD, for example, was used as justification for one of the most disastrous wars ever unleashed, certainly in modern times, which only succeeded in plunging Iraq and the wider entire region into a dark night of terrorism and sectarian bloodletting  It is a state of affairs that shows no evidence of abating anytime soon, 13 years later  Following on from that, when Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, he did so as the supposed antidote to the arrogance and mendacity that typified the Bush years before him  One of his very first pledges upon taking office was that he would close of the controversial US prison facility, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, during his first term in office  It was a pledge and an announcement that met with support across the world, given that along with rendition, waterboarding and torture, the very name Guantanamo conjured up his predecessor s war on terror, which replaced international law with might is right as the cornerstone of global affairs  Yet despite Obama s pledge, 15 years later Guantanamo remains in operation  Behind its bars 37 inmates, denied the right to due process, continue to be held in a state of legal limbo  Compounding the scandal of this US military prison facility is the fact it exists on Cuba s sovereign territory despite repeated demands by the Cuban government for it to be returned  More recently, we have had the scandal of thePanama Papers, containing evidence of mass and wholesale financial and tax impropriety by leading politicians, corporate executives and the super-rich  However, an even bigger story has been the politicization of the information contained within these papers throughout the Western media, involving a transparent attempt to smear Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, even though neither his name nor the name of any member of his family appears anywhere in them  This is no surprise considering that the misnamed International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), based in Washington, is the body responsible for leaking the information to the media  The ICIJ is the international arm of the US Center for Public Integrity, an organization that counts among its major donors George Soros s Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and the Carnegie Endowment, among others  This has to explain why out of all the people whose names have been leaked thus far there are conspicuously few American citizens among them  Do they really expect us to believe that the US is immune to financial corruption? Really? Wall Street, the global financial crisis, the land of corporate greed and malfeasance, yet up to now not one major name from the world of politics, business, or banking is included within the Panama Papers? With this in mind, it really doesn t take a genius to discern the agenda being pursued here  This brings us back to this latest example of US bad faith and lack of integrity when it comes to fulfilling its agreements and international obligations vis-Ã -vis Russia  By now, Moscow should be accustomed to being lied to by Washington  Whether it is the assurances given to the last Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev that upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union there would be no eastward expansion of NATO, which were not kept, or the manipulation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 to effect regime change in Libya by NATO, time and again the US government, either unilaterally or via Washington-controlled international bodies, has proved that not only its word but its official stamp on treaties and agreements is meaningless  In this regard, the words of none other than Sitting Bull have proved eerily prescient over the generations since the great Indian warrior-chief uttered them  ""There are things they tell us that sound good to hear, but when they have accomplished their purpose they will go home and will not try to fulfill our agreements with them "" Sitting Bull s analysis of Washington and its integrity has stood the test of time  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/339039-plutonium-us-russia-deal-panama/

ironically given the ICIJ and the OCCRP s funding it s billionaire global capitalists like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash  Here s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super-rich as elite-friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II  In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005  Last October, Oxfamrevealedthat half the world s wealth was in the hands of just one percent of the population  The Panama leaks, described by whistleblower Edward Snowden as the biggest leak in the history of data journalism, show us how the global super-rich exploit the current system still further to keep their wealth away from the taxman - and get even richer at our expense  And what the revelations make clear is that the super-rich wouldn t be able to do this without the help of banks, lawyers, accountants and other intermediaries who most clearly do not act in the public interest  British neocons and Sorosian liberals who no doubt gloated over Monday s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes out smelling of roses, it s Washington s most obedient ally- Britain -

As opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn correctly stated: This is money that s taken from our health service, our local services  At a time of plenty, tax-dodging by the super-rich might lead to a shrug of the shoulders, but at a time of cuts which are havingdisastrous consequenceson individuals and communities,it s enough to turn the mildest, most politically moderate person into a pitchfork-carrying revolutionary  One name you know you'll never find in the#PanamaPapers: Jeremy Bernard Corbyn#OurCorbynpic twitter com/VLlxuK4pui In Britain the #PanamaPapers revelations are likely to provide a boost for Jeremy Corbyn ahead of important local elections next month  And in America, Bernie Sanders could be the beneficiary  An article in Wednesday s Independent newspaper in Britainarguesthat The Panama Papers could hand Bernie Sanders the White House  Nobody is going to be under more pressure than Hillary Clinton, argues Matthew Turner  For some Americans, she is the embodiment of a 'global elite;' while Bernie Sanders is its antithesis The huge leak exposes governments across the globe willfully ignoring tax avoidance by the rich  Although Clinton has not been linked to any malfeasance in the leak, there is a sense that she is among the elite rich, some of whose members have benefited from such schemes  Well, if the #PanamaPapers do help Bernie to the White House - and indeed Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 in Britain - we can only imagine what George Soros s reaction would be  After all this is a man who hasdonated$7m to a Hillary Clinton super PAC  For all his progressive talk, the very last thing the liberal George Soros would like to see is a return of socialistic economies in the West and across the world  He has after all spent decades helping to topple and destabilize governments which put their people before the interests of predatory global capitalists and hedge funders like himself  Is his anti-Putin obsession so great he d risk bringing the whole system down with him?

Trump on Putin s compliment: Great honor httPS: //t co/WPsiSWKYQApic twitter com/2WmfxnGvsn Last week, for example, demonstrations in Chicago organized by the Soros-funded MoveOn org group forced Trump to cancel a speaking engagement  Later, on March 20, members of the same subversive outfitblocked trafficnear a Trump event in Arizona, while police in New York City the same day pepper-sprayed demonstrators, some of whom are affiliated with violent anarchist groups  And then there s the corporate-owned media, which, instead of impartially and dispassionately reporting on Trump s rising star, is working on behalf of its owners to knock it out of the sky  Here is a random CNN smearpiece, which opens with the angst-ridden line: Anti-Trump Republicans desperate to stop the billionaire from being their nominee are discussing creative ways to halt his momentum  So the story now is not about the millions of Americans who support Trump's political ideas, nor even discussing what those ideas might be, but rather about how the""racist, misogynist, sexist""outsider must be stopped  Consider these two competing lines from another CNNarticle, and how they work to manipulate the mind of the reader regarding the boastful Trump and the proud Clinton: Trump repeatedly boasts about the failure of millions of dollars in attack aids to wound his campaign, and insists he is on pace to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination  While the very next about Clinton reads: Clinton said she was ""very proud"" to have won Arizona and hit Republican candidates who she said were literally inciting bigotry and violence  But it is not just the Democrats and the liberal media working to sabotage Trump s campaign  Incredibly, even the Republican Party is""plotting against their own frontrunner,""as Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox Newsexplained  But why would the GOP work against Trump if he represents the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? #HillaryClintonspeaks at#AIPAC2016conference [VIDEO]httPS: //t co/X1yGaBHOvM Pirro nails it with this answer to herself: The Republican establishment are in bed with the Democrats  So if Hillary wins, nothing is lost for them  It s business as usual  The lobbyists keep their offices on K Street, the pharmaceutical companies keep paying them and the lawmakers get their re-election bribes - I mean, contributions  Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, when asked to explain the elite s refusal to support Trump, perhaps gave away a bit too much information when hesaid: Well, because he s an outsider, he s not them, he s not part of the club, he s uncontrollable, he hasn t been through the initiation rites, he didn t belong to the secret society  Initiation rites? Secret societies? Secret handshakes? Did Newt just join ranks with the conspiracy theorists? Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra-wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers  One of his regular claims - aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico  Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him  Although it is a delicious sight watching America's movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold-hearted wretchedness of the dual-party, borderline-fascist system  Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega-wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks  The Establishment would continue unmolested with its'too-big-to-jail'banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power  Trump's ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized  Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they'd work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors  Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril  This polarizing issue largely explains Trump's huge popularity among voters today  The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back  In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump's political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it  Amazing comments from the Pope- considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor  But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens  Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank-you-very-much  Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good-paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff-raff  According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year  So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US-Mexican border  But the crazy is just beginning  Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance  FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall  He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing  Only the government could script such a narrative  But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag-saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings  The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, said Garza  This right here is border insecurity at its best  Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities  If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right-wing parties, I really can t imagine it  And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political-correct-speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from  No, sending a message to other would-be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago  Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico  After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors  Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W  Bush s reckless 8-year war on terror  Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze  Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it  ""He never explained that decision to the public A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be  All Americans knew    is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job  Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump  Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies  Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non-consequential 8-year intermission by America s first black president)  Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex-president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree)  I think this is a       great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, she told C-Span early last year  I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that  But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber  There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America's former shine  @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/

Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I'm confused  Very confused  Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately'weaponizing the migration/refugee crisis to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve'  According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe  How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute  I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives  If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia s intervention in Syria-on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011  Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011- so surely it s more accurate to accuse them of weaponising the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded  Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return ""Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government  We want people to come back to Syria,""hesaidin February  Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria  ""I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back,""he said, asreportedby Telesur  And this is the man who - along with Putin- we are told is deliberately weaponising migration by the NATO commander? I m confused  Can anyone help me? I m also confused - very confused in fact- by the portrayal of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as a 'progressive' who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be 'the lesser of two evils'  Now, from what I ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and regime changer' whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place  Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton s foreign policy record in this 2015article  Among Hillary s boasts are that she urged her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia  The innocent civilians killed in the illegal 'humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton urged included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy - an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces  Four years later, Hillary sided with hard-right Republican Party hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq  Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa  But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS  You don t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny  ""We came  We saw  He died!"" Last week on George Galloway s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party s Dr Jill Stein told us Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support   How does Clinton s record make her 'progressive'? Or has the word progressive today been redefined to mean an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge-fund billionaire GeorgeSoros  I m confused  Can anyone help me?  The EU referendum  Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo  But I m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for Brexit in June s Referendum  We'retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for national security and in order todealwith Russian aggression   ""Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn't support""@DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic twitter com/evltbtGyuo We re told a Brexit would shock the world economy  And the UK itself wouldbreak up But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn't in the EEC/EU  And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well  In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of £550m  As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: The public finances were also in rude health - a borrowing requirement of £1 96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of £600m by the end of 1969  And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969  Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre-EEC accession era, but the UK wasn t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv)  So our national security clearly didn t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU  Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it s a different world today  But Norway and Switzerland aren't in the EU and didn t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited  Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation  The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people  Leading bankers  City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders  Tony Blair  They can t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I m confused  Can anyone help me? I m confused- still confused- about the ongoing investigation into the MH-17 plane disaster  After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong evidence that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air- missile  We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot-down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft,""said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014  But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data  Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators  Now if it was so clear cut that rebels supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago  I m confused  Can anyone help me? I m also confused about what we ve been told by western political figures about Russia s intervention in Syria  When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and 'moderate Syria opposition forces   ""You have a strong propaganda message that says you re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October  But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a warning shot for Russia  But if Russia hadn t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we've seen renewed allegations that Russia isn t hitting IS  But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals  Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January:""It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary  This is no longer the case "" How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS s air force'  Surely IS would be advancing if Russia s campaign was really aiding the group? I m confused  Can anyone help me? Finally I m confused about Turkey and British support for democratic values   British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a long-standing goal for Britain  His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons  When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an""important ally""  Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper  A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court  ""By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan s government is steamrolling over human rights, says Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International  Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid:""The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly  The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated    Impunity for human rights abuses persisted  The independence of the judiciary was further eroded "" Now, neocons always tell us that they re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy- so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes  So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond? Instead of condemning Turkey s undemocratic crackdowns, Hammond tweets about extending sanctions on Russia  Agreed at#AmiensFGBon need to keep EU sanctions against Russia until full#Minskagreement implementation#Ukrainepic twitter com/RqAooF4UPV The accessioncriteriafor membership of the EU includes:""stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities "" Why are neocons so keen on Turkey joining the EU when its clear that these conditions are not met?I m confused  Can anyone help me?

"4 Mar, 2016","EU s refusal to accept Ukraine exposes Kiev s deceit of its own people, says Russian MP","The Ukrainian people remain hostage to the deceitful Kiev regime, but no one is ready to welcome them into Europe, the head of the State Duma s Committee for Security and Countering Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, has told reporters  The comments came soon after the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said in a speech in The Hague that he does not expect Ukraine to join the European Union or NATO in the nearest 20 or even 25 years  Ukraine will definitely not be able to become a member of the EU in the next 20-25 years, and not of NATO either, Juncker said, as quoted by German news agency DPA  Yarovaya gave her comments on the matter to RIA Novosti: The EU and NATO do not value the sacrifice of the Ukrainian elite  The deceived and dispossessed Ukrainian people remain hostages of the mad and cynical instigators of Maidan, she said  Euromaidan activists have already packed their bags, but it turned out that they still have nowhere to go no one expects them anywhere, Yarovaya added, using the Euromaidan term coined by mass media two years ago to describe the protests against the cancelation of Ukraine s association agreement with the European Union  The discontent eventually resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovich, and led to the establishment of the current Kiev regime  READ MORE: Ukraine-EU agreement a George Soros road to nowhere - Keiser The association agreement went into force provisionally on January 1 this year, but it still requires support from all 28 members of the European Union  A public opinion poll conducted by the Russian state-owned agency VTSIOM in late February this year showed that many Russians now see the Ukrainian political crisis as anarchy and banditry caused by the policies of the Kiev authorities and provoked from Washington  When researchers asked the respondents to describe the Maidan events, 34 percent said they saw them as anarchy and banditry, 18 percent called them a coup d Ã©tat and 12 percent said that the events can be described as civil war  READ MORE: Ukraine turmoil triggered by US provocations, majority of Russians maintain When asked about their ideas on the reasons behind the Ukrainian crisis, 20 percent of Russians named the wrong political course chosen by the Kiev authorities, 19 percent said it was the result of a deliberate provocation on the part of the United States, and 13 percent answered that the crisis stemmed from the typical struggle between politicians and businessmen for power and resources  ",https://www.rt.com/russia/334532-eus-refusal-to-accept-ukraine/
"26 Feb, 2016","Pentagon update: US, not Russia, responsible for breaking Islamic State","The Pentagon has a lot of money to spend on propaganda  But its white-washing Russia out of progress in Syria has an increasingly propaganda-savvy audience howling, and is a poor use of resources  This week, the Pentagon information machine made some pronouncements which saw the light of day in media outlets which includedAOLand theDaily Mail  In materially identical pieces, US Army propagandist Colonel Steve Warren fires off several rounds of bullet points to the effect that Islamic State is beginning to crack under the onslaught of air strikes and counter-terror measures , and that would-be jihadis are realising that""this caliphate isn't all unicorns and rainbows"" whatever that means  His main bombardment consists of the notion that we have the US to thank for this progress  He says: We see them having lost about 40% of the territory that they held at the pinnacle of their strength in Iraq, and they have lost about 10% of the territory they once held in Syria  We believe this failure is due to several factors, the first and foremost I believe is the presence of devastating Coalition air power  ""Second is the increasing capability of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq  ""And third is the increasing cohesion, strength and unity of the 65-nation coalition that has come together to defeat Daesh  The problem with the colonel s presentation from a propaganda point of view is that it is not very good  It is too blunt  People are more sophisticated than this even people who spend a lot of time on the Daily Mail website  Whether you like Putin or not, his decisiveness in Syria was a game-changer  After years of pretending to chase ISIS, the US was suddenly shown to have been merely simulating activity for entirely different ends  Russia, on the other hand, went in to clean house and has worked effectively with the army of Syria to that end  Any grown-up apportioning of credit which leaves out the key players discredits itself before it begins  It s like trying to discuss 'Gone with the Wind' without reference to either Scarlett or Rhett  Yet this is Colonel Warren s approach  He simply disregards everything which doesn t suit him: the fact that the US-led coalition has no legal mandate in Syria; that Assad is the democratically elected head of that country; that the US is engaged in destroying arbitrarily and unilaterally (in fact, if not in name) yet another foreign state which has done it no harm; that finally and emphatically if the resolve of this group of US-sponsored terrorists is beginning to crack , it is thanks entirely to the efforts of the Syrian Army and the air support provided by the only outside country to have a legitimate role in Syria: Russia  #ISISeasy to defeat if#Turkeyand#SaudiArabiadid not support it Assad s adviser to RThttPS: //t co/JY5GJCdSCZpic twitter com/ND8VdtlBrO The colonel has a tough job on his hands  Too many people now understand that what is needed for the defeat of so-called Islamic State, is for the US government to cease providing it with arms and funding  They know that this chameleon-like organization only makes any sense when seen as an arm of US-Israeli policy; to Balkanise the Middle East and make it easier to control, and to facilitate the theft of their wealth by corporations; its secondary purpose in combination with the efforts of men likeGeorge Soros is to create the blowback needed to justify an invasion of Europe by an army of aggressive, unskilled young men in order to asset-strip it, drag it into chaos, and prevent what the US fears most: a new union built around afreer Germany co-joined with Russia  Agents of US military ambitions such as the CIA have always created media outlets - or subverted existing ones as part of propaganda wars against foreign countries  But two thorns appeared in the side of this policy in recent years  Firstly, in a world connected by the internet, propaganda intended for foreign consumption routinely feeds back into the US arena, thereby falling foul of laws against the use of US tax dollars to conduct informational war against the taxpayers themselves  Secondly, again in a world connected by the internet, US citizens are increasingly discovering uncomfortable truths about everything from 9/11 to banking and medical cartels  Thus, distrust of government internally is a growing problem for those tasked with managing the population  As ForeignPolicy comnotes, the philosophical foundation for the policy of not using US tax dollars to propagandize US citizens was to maintain a distinction between the US and the Soviet Union  Happily for those burdened by such concerns, the Soviet Union is no more, and in 2013 the US removed the last fig leaf of pretense that the US government did not engage in propaganda internally  This makes everything simpler  The war propaganda machine can lump the US citizenry together with everyone else and get on with the job of bringing or keeping everyone on board with whatever the Pentagon s masters wish it to do  In a war scenario and the US is almost always making war on someone budgets extend and keep themilitary industrial complexmaking more for its shareholders  The guiding principle of those who get the government contracts which collectively make wars happen is to ensure that the last penny gets spent so that the same amount or preferably more will be forthcoming in the next financial period  The US military, then, is a huge state-run business in the form of a bureaucratic and accounting machine tasked with blowing things up as a function of securing funding  It manages to kill a lot of people, but it is a blunt if heavy instrument  It was described to me by a friend then himself serving in US Army Intelligence as the Post Office with bombs   Like any large organization it works on a system of protocols  There will be a manual somewhere which tells you what a nail is, what a hammer is, and how the two are to be used together  Then in the context of the US military there will be a Halliburton contract for huge numbers of hammers and nails, and a general somewhere with shares in Halliburton who will find a use for both  In the view of military planners, then, propaganda is just another hammer  Recent figures are conspicuously hard to find, but Fox Newsreportedback in 2009 that the Pentagon was spending $4 7 billion annually on what it calls""the human terrain""of world public opinion, employing an army of 27,000 whose sole mission was the promotion of US military objectives via media  What the numbers are today, we can only guess  But it won t be less because it never is  Planners of military propaganda will allocate their budgets the same as any public relations company  That is, they will focus on predetermined demographics and opinion leaders endlessly testing and measuring to see what is working, what not and using the data thus generated to provide the engine for new, expensive proposals to the client  The delivery method or tactic to use public-relations speak which Colonel Warren employed this week has become almost hackneyed through over-use  It is to claim the narrative as fully owned; to assume the conclusions one wishes to see as given; to deny the existence of either the legitimate claims or participation of any party or view but those which suit one s agenda  While many consumers of propaganda may not understand this model intellectually, increasing numbers recognize it viscerally  They have an intuitive appreciation of the genre, having been exposed to it many thousands of times  The state of Israel uses it to exclude the Palestinians from any debate about their own land; corporations use it to achieve and maintain monopolies; governments use it to keep people paying income tax  Subconsciously, the model is associated with various forms of oppression and tyranny  This hammer-and-nail school of propaganda has its roots in a vertical and uniform, pre-internet informational model  The model today is broad and disparate; people can shop for opinions  The colonel s activities this week will have helped eat some small part of the budget, but I would argue that this particular assault was a bad use of resources  It is too on-the-nose  It looks too much like what it is: a hammer  And as people rumble the type of tactic employed above by the Pentagon, they tend to regard the source thereafter as unreliable on point of principle not a good outcome if your goal is to cultivate""the human terrain""of world public opinion to your advantage  @SamGerrans LISTEN MORE: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333700-pentagon-propaganda-us-russia/
"25 Feb, 2016",Ukraine's 'Song for Europe' violates the spirit of Eurovision,"The propaganda war against Russia is waged on many fronts  Even, I regret to say, in an international song contest which is supposed to be above politics  is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger  His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspot com  He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Ukraine has chose for its entry to this year s Eurovision Song Contest, 1944 , a song all about the forced deportation of 240,000 Crimean Tatars ordered by the dictator Joseph Stalin in the 1940s  Never mind the contest s rules which bans songs of an overtly political nature; never mind the fact that Stalin was not the leader of Russia but the Soviet Union, and that he was a Georgian and not a Russian  Despite all that, let s use Eurovision to engage in some crude Russia-bashing, shall we? I m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily  1944 opens with the chilling description:""When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we re not guilty  ""I had to write it  It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it, saysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar-Armenian family  I m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier  ""There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow,""went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry 'Ding-a-dong,' performed by Teach-In back in 1975  But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead-singer of Teach-In  Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia  There s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done - especially if, like me, you are a long-standing Eurovision fan who s been watching the event since the 1970s  The provocative, politically-motivated decision to chose 1944 as their Song for Europe goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision  The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows  Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory  But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward  When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons  When Johnny Logan performed What s Another Year , the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn t singing about the Anglo-Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest  Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking  The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision  Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of 1944 ? Believe it or not, it s not just Ukrainians - or Crimean Tatars - who have had some very bad things done to them in the past  The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999  The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars  Russia could sing about the 5 7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France s invasion of 1812  The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica  The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe  Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings  And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years  And so on  Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities - and even genocides  Few countries in Europe haven t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point - and on top of that there s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on - and singing about - today  It s not the first time those with an anti-Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign  In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: We don t Wanna Put In   The artists did not deny their song was a""protest against Russian policies""  The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so  Therulesof Eurovision state that""No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest  Ukraine s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March  Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There s method in Kiev s apparent madness  If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she ""just had to write"", in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent  We ll all be under pressure to give the song Douze Points to show our solidarity with Ukraine  If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote  Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that 'free speech' is under threat in Europe because we can't hear '1944'  I m sure we ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself  Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala  The West s free speech crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites  They didn't say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year s Eurovision - not for the lyrics of their song, which was called Wars for nothing' but because one of the captions in the song s videocontainedthe words: 2014 Gaza two-thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children   Israel wasn't mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war  But that didn t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary s broadcasting authority, with the result that the offending words in the video were removed  While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting Israel who s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests Hungary s Eurovision entry there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting Wars for nothing   Already the sort of media outlets you d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and 1944   Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) ""Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them I would not want to see history repeat itself,"" Jamalatoldthe US Congress-funded station  ""RFE/RL is smart power  Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for,""saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009  Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics!

"18 Feb, 2016",What matters most: Human rights or the rights of Western governments?,"It seemed unthinkable that after the Iraq tragedy and the ensuing chaos that followed the 2003 US-led war there would ever be any support for another attack on an Arab country  And yet eight years after the invasion of Iraq, international opinion almost unanimously supported NATO operations in Libya  Conveniently labeled'no fly zone'at inception, the idea was to wage war against Muammar Gaddafi and force him out of office, like Saddam Hussein before him  The escalation from simply stopping Libyan planes from flying to bombing raids would not have been acceptable to an ever increasingly skeptical public without the much needed support of the'human rights'industry  This prosperous sector operates the easily marketable commodity that is'humanity   The idea is that some organizations, based in Western capitals, have a moral imperative to decide what humanity is and how it should be dispensed  Their'respectability'should derive from their fairness, objectivity and commitment to justice  That of course is in principle, in reality their objectives are shaped by those who fund them and allow them to operate  In the case of Human Rights Watch, one of the most high profile NGOs today, its connection to the US government was so intimate that notable academics and scholars penned a letter in 2014 criticizing its executive director's close links or'revolving door'policy with the US State Department  That relationship is so cozy that while many grassroots activist have denounced the US over police brutality or the disproportionate number of black victims as well as the number of inmates currently held in custody without trial it begs the question of why would a human rights organization which aims to dispense its values to numerous governments across the world appear so blind to the very abuses committed on its own doorstep  The answer is that HRW, today viewed as one of the two major human rights organizations alongside Amnesty, only looks at the errors committed by countries whose politics the US disapproves of  HRW favors an interventionist agenda and as a result supports almost all wars waged by the US under the cover of'humanitarian responsibility,'even when the consequences of these military operations would always lead to increased human suffering  In the case of the conflict in Syria, HRW's Ken Roth, at the helm of the organization far longer than the average Arab president remains in power, was pushing the now debunked story of Assad forces using chemical weapons against civilians in Ghouta His public statementsthrough social media contradicted even UN reports carried out on the ground in a bid to pursue what he qualifies as a responsibility to protect  However, that responsibility is often carried out through bombing operations The approach in the US is that a Western response is always best and that ultimately only Westerners know best  Despite boasting'divisions'for each region of the world (Africa division/Middle East division etc ) the staff manning these sections are almost all exclusively American with only local researchers appointed to junior or mid-ranking positions  With all the intellectual competence in these various geographies, it should have seemed reasonable to expect senior figures in an organization with an international outlook to have a more international team and yet that is far from the case to this day  When even its largest donor, multi-billionaire George Soros argues that HRW has to be more effective and be seen as more international, less an American organization, something is clearly wrong  But when Soros donates a staggering$100 millionto an outfit with such proven ties to the US government what does he expect in exchange? In these times of war and climatic instability, feeding the hungry and providing health care to the ill would take priority over offering a huge sum of money to an organization that already operates on a very comfortablebudgetof around $50 million per year  George Soros is no ordinary man; he is one of the wealthiest financiers on the planet who has made no secret of where his politics lie  Earlier this month, hewrotein the UK's Guardian that Russia sPresident Putinwas one of the greatest threats to Europe  While appearing to be critical of both sides on the Ukraine-Russia tension, HRW continues to portray Russia as a brutal dictatorship that allows no dissent feeding into the now deeply ingrained perception across much of the West that Russia constitutes a major threat to Europe, another one-sided view that is in accordance with US policy and not internationally, where Russia enjoys far greater support outside Europe and North America  Another interesting appointment was that of Tom Malinowski in 2001  He was Senior Director on the National Security Council at the White House, before becoming Washington Director for Human Rights Watch  Since he left HRW he has returned to a US government position where he nowservesas Assistant Secretary in the Bureau for Democracy in the State Department  Because of its close ties to US officials as well as donors with very clear agendas, HRW has seen its credibility suffer a major blow  More nuanced organizations such as Amnesty International operate far more effectively due in great part to their astute politics  Avoiding all the pitfalls, HRW fell into, AI has in recent years been the respectable face of the now discredited human rights industry and yet its support for avoidable wars has been just as serious if not worse  While present in the early days of the Libyan uprisings, AI teams were able to witness the absence of massacres reported across the Western media  Keen to'sell'a necessary war to Western audiences some'rebels'were courting Western outfitsspeaking of10,000 protesters slaughtered in a matter of days later proven to be false  AI hadissuedstatements with headlines pointing almost exclusively to government forces attacks before stating, some paragraphs below, that both sides were committing atrocities  The attention grabbing headlines were enough to make the casus-belli stronger and analysts and observers, incapable of questioning the motives behind the misleading headlines, would later be unable to challenge such subversive descriptions of the conflict, a conflict that would eventually leave Libya a failed state in the hands of various terrorist groups  As with most if not all NGOs, AIfocusesalmost exclusively on violations of human rights committed in third world countries therefore giving the impression that violations are only committed outside the West  While its members continuously campaign for African leaders to be handed over to The Hague to face prosecutions for war crimes, it is yet to make any public pronouncement on the former British prime minister's role in the war in Iraq, despite Britain being a signatory to the International Criminal Court of justice  It has therefore become a comforting short-cut to denounce government politics while turning to'human rights'organizations representing a moral compass, albeit in accordance with Western opinion  While some projects are at times commendable, it appears that these operations' close relationships with Western authority points to a sinister agenda that simply sugar-coats the horrors of war  Human rights should be about ensuring people live in dignity and sheltered from unnecessary violence  What the human rights industry has provided is a new narrative: if you die as a result of a Western bomb than you've been responsibly protected  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332877-human-rights-watch-soros/
"16 Feb, 2016",Soros (seriously) underestimates his audience by blaming Putin for EU refugee crisis,"George Soros, the billionaire investor whose own native country of Hungary accused him of betraying Europe by supporting refugees escaping war-torn regions of the Middle East has turned around and blamed Vladimir Putin for the humanitarian crisis  Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In anopinion piecereleased last week, Soros seeks to prove that President Putin was working to foster the EU s disintegration by flooding the continent with refugees, allegedly as a result of the Russian military s foray into Syria where it has dealt a lethal blow to Islamic State forces  George Soros is no fool, of course  He will go down in the history books as the man who broke the Bank of England an achievement that, while conspicuously lacking a moral chromosome and ethical outlook, took no small amount of mental finesse to pull off  And that s why Soros s anti-Putin rant is so strange: it is so illogical and blatantly wrong-headed - to the point where a sense of desperation oozes between the lines  Soros s argument comes down to this: Putin s decision to launch a military offensive in Syria was not to halt the encroachment of Islamic State, the most despicable gang of terrorist thugs to step foot on the world stage, but primarily as a means of dividing Europe  And I quote: An EU that is coming apart at the seams will not be able to maintain the sanctions it imposed on Russia following its incursion into Ukraine, he wrote  On the contrary, Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti-European parties that he has carefully cultivated  Unsurprisingly, this line of rubbish failed to hoodwink the overwhelming majority of readers which Soros apparently believes are too ignorant to connect the dots between Syria, Russia and Europe  Indeed, it was sheer entertainment perusing the Guardian sreader commentsection following the article, which proves Soros seriously underestimates his audience s grasp of geopolitical issues  My personal favorite anti-Soros jibe came courtesy of Peter Whitelaw, who wrote: We ve been bombing the Middle East off and on for the past 30 years   Russia does it for two months and they are the biggest threat ever   If we re not bombing Middle Eastern countries then we re selling arms to them so they can do the bombing instead of us  To that succinct comment I would add the question: If Soros really thinks it such a horrible thing that refugees from the Middle East and beyond are storming the gates of Europe, why has he been advocating on behalf of just such a scenario for many years now? In October,  Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, whose country finally halted the flow of refugees by installing a razor-tipped fence along the length of its southern border,called out Sorosby name when he said the schemes of well organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation-states and leader who have never been elected could come to fruition  Europe has been betrayed, Orban continued  If we don t stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here  Orban s public chastisement of Soros behavior is not without foundation  One month before the Hungarian leader voiced his concerns, Soros had published yet another opinionmasterpiece, this one entitled, Rebuilding the Asylum System  In it, he expressed bewilderment that each  member state [of the EU] has selfishly focused on its own interests to the point where the asylum seekers have been the main victims (Incidentally, I ve yet to hear Soros come out and defend the hundreds of German women  who were sexuallyassaultedby refugee men during the course of New Year s Eve celebrations)  With an arrogance that almost defies belief, Soros goes on to argue as if the European people have absolutely no say in the matter whatsoever that since the origin of the current crisis is Syria, the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority therefore the European Union has an obligation to distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states  Blood and Tears: Chaotic scenes at Hungarian border as#refugeescome under tear gashttPS: //t co/TXvLxfdfoDpic twitter com/mgBnHDKXwD This breathtaking comment is followed by a 6-point plan  for the EU to follow  It should suffice for our purpose to just quote Soros first point, which alone probably launched 1,000 right-wing parties in Europe: The EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future and  provide ¬15,000 ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs  As my colleague Lionel would say, let that comment marinate for a moment: ""The EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future?"" Really? Now take a second and perform a simple reality check and ask, Which individual is really seeking the disintegration of Europe: George Soros, with his Open invitation to every asylum seeker in the Middle East and beyond (it has already been exposed in the German media that the majority of asylum seekers entering Europe do not come from Syria, but are predominantly from other countries that were previously torn asunder by US-backed military offensives/adventures, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) or Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was formally invited by Damascus to initiate a military offensive against ISIS forces, which up to that point had not been noticeably weakened despite Western claims that it was fighting the terrorist organization? Furthermore, what would Russia stand to gain by flooding the European continent of which it is a geographical part of with desperate asylum seekers, many of whom may actually be card-carrying members of lethal terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and Islamic State? Finally, Russia s economy would hardly recover anytime soon if Europe - its largest trading partner - is somehow reduced to violence, sectarian strife and chaos as Soros somehow asserts  Given Soros powerful influence and clout among some European bureaucrats, it seems his outrageous anti-Russia position has gained some traction among some predictable circles  This is especially the case with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is desperately in need of a scapegoat for the refugee crisis as far-right nationalist groups, likePegida, are enjoying a groundswell of public enthusiasm not just in Germany but also across Europe  Exactly one day before Soros anti-Putin piece hit the newsstands, Merkel was paying a visit to Turkey, of all places, where she Well, let s just let George Soros explain what she was doing there: Angela  Merkel flew to Ankara on February 9 to make last-minute arrangements with the Turkish government to induce the refugees already in Turkey to prolong their stay there  She offered to airlift 200,000-300,000 Syrian refugees annually directly to Europe on the condition that Turkey prevent them from going to Greece and will accept them back if they do so  Yes! With a wave of Merkel's magic wand, no more unsightly photo opportunities from nosy journalists featuring throngs of unwashed hordes storming the EU gates  Why, that would have derailed George Soros oops, I mean Vladimir Putin s plan to overrun Europe with a future low-wage labor pool and a divide-and-conquer carnival  Just what Europe needs as their venal leaders in reality, nothing more than mindless technocrats enforce harsh austerity measures on young and old alike  Merkel just cut through all the unsightly mess and awarded the refugees frequent flier mileage points right smack into the heart of Europe where they will be paid ¬15,000 ($16,800) each  if Soros gets his way courtesy of European taxpayers that is, those who are still employed and can pay taxes  Meanwhile, last but not least, Soros rarely spouts venom at Turkey, Saudi Arabia and all of the other usual suspects who are in some way complicit in the extremely curious rise of Islamic State, a group of savages, we are led to believe, that possessed enough business savvy to become the owners and operators of a lucrative oil business, exporting vast amounts of Syria s finest right past the Turkish border and into European gas tanks  Nor did Soros have any harsh words of condemnation for Turkish President Erdogan, who extended his thanks to Russia for cleaning up Syria s terrorist infestation problem by shooting a Russian fighter jet out of a clear blue sky in November, thereby ratcheting up tensions in the Syrian theater to unprecedented levels  Unfortunately, individuals like George Soros, who certainly have the funds and the brains to make a positive difference in places like Europe and Syria, have chosen instead to spread vicious anti-Russia propaganda so thin and conspicuous it actually flies back and damages their own misguided cause, as opposed to the purposeful actions of their purported enemies  @Robert_Bridge This article first appeared in a slightly altered form inRethinking Russia  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332655-soros-says-putin-blame-syria/
"13 Feb, 2016",George Soros: A psychopath s psychopath,"According to Soros, Russia s strategy is to avoid collapse by making the EU implode first by exacerbating the migration crisis and stoking Islamophobia   On February 11,the Guardianran anarticleby George Soros which had run a day earlierhereentitled Putin is a bigger threat to Europe s existence than Isis  After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion  Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order  I have met a few psychopaths in my life a pernicious but small-time example is a real-estate salesman in Spain who cost my family a great deal of time and money  The real problem with psychopaths big-time and small-time is not primarily that they do bad things, but that we non-psychopaths are ill-prepared to deal with the fundamental difference between us and them  We people with operational consciences think (wrongly) that everyone is like us  We are shackled to the assumption that just because we would not do unspeakably evil things or would be unable to live with ourselves if we did all other people work the same way  They do not  When a psychopath lies, or steals, or manipulates or does whatever he thinks is required to get what he wants he has no greater emotional connection with his actions than you or I have with yesterday s lunch  We, the non-psychopaths, tell little lies and do little wrongs  But we have a limit beyond which we will not go  For the psychopath, scale makes no difference  Stealing a family s savings, or crashing an economy, or destroying a country is of no more consequence to the psychopath than deciding not to return ten bucks to a cashier who had made a mistake  And no matter what evil the psychopath meticulously plotted and practiced against you, to him, what happens is your fault  Always  Which brings me back to George Soros  Inthe Guardian sarticle, then, Soros claims the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State  The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood  My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writerGearÃ³id Ã ColmÃ¡in, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so-called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what Ã ColmÃ¡in rightly calls a tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite   In an interview withRT, Ã ColmÃ¡in said, There is no War on Terror  There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony  And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe  In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies  There is no such thing as ISIS  ISIS is a creation of the United States  Soros and his ilk created and benefit from what Soros calls Islamic State, yet his argument not only disregards that fact, it kicks blame in the direction of the one major power Russia which has taken steps to deal with this US creation  Soros goes on to make a number of other accusations against Russia, failing at any time to note that Russia alone has a mandate from the legitimate government of Syria, or that Russia is seriously engaged in cleaning house in Syria, a job the US was only simulating  Acknowledgement of Russia s successes in Syria comes from many quarters, includingSeymour Hersh  Hersh is a high-profile American journalist, but one incapable of understanding the reasons for US policy towards Syria, bless him  Soros next point is that Putin s aim is to foster the EU s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees  The truth is that Russia s natural ally is Germany and preventing that alliance is the primary aim of the US government at least according toStratfor, a US intelligence agency  Germany s efficiency and organizational abilities combined with Russia s raw materials, inventive genius, and good relations with China, is the combination those funding and directing ISIS least want to see  By occupying Germany with an army of aggressive, unskilled, culturally insoluble economic migrants from Africa and elsewhere, the chess-players at the board of realpolitik are attempting to head off that natural outcome  Soros part in destabilizing Europe is well attested The Daily Mailreported back in November 2015 that Soros was busy telling the EU to take at least a million refugees every year  In the same article, Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is quoted as saying, This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state  Orban went on, This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros  Soros described in the article as a funder of pro-migration groups all over the world responded to Orban s comments by arguing that his beliefs uphold European values   I don t know what Soros means by European values, but I assume it includes lots more immigration for us unilaterally decided upon by Mr  Soros  As prime minister of Hungary, Orban is a man with, perhaps, better access than most to the truth about George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary the source for which information is his own father s book Masquerade Dancing Around Death in Nazi-Occupied Hungary  Thus, Soros has moved effortlessly from collaborating with the Nazis against his fellow Jews an occupation (if you will excuse the pun) he makes little effort to hide totellingindigenous European peoples what the ethnic make-up of their countries should be  He was also instrumental in the destruction of Ukraine  As reported byNew American, Soros has a giant footprint in Ukraine  Similar to his operations in dozens of other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens ofmillions of dollarsinto Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into a more open and democratic society  We have good reason to take George Soros seriously  Soros article downplays Putin s strategic prowess before going on to anticipate regime change in Russia in 2017 as a result of bankruptcy forced upon it by Western sanctions and crushed oil prices  He then appears to credit Putin with masterminding a collapse in Europe and of anticipating benefits for Russia in the aftermath  He notes, As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy it  If you find yourself asking here: Why then did she create that crisis? that is because you are not a psychopath  Soros article begins its descent with metaphysical and social observations, which from someone without billions of dollars behind them would be seen as merely subjective musings, before landing squarely on the runway of identifying Putin s Russia as the real threat  This is not simplychutzpah  The traits Soros exhibits are those of textbook psychopathy: blaming others for his own actions and attacking the victim is what the psychopath does  Here, Soros disregards entirely his own extensive role in creating the problem he purports to seek to solve; meanwhile, he accuses Russia, the only country to man-up to the war on Syria, of being behind the migration Soros has spent millions engineering  Soros is part of a cabal which plans the overthrow of countries at dinner  Psychopathy is the baseline requirement for membership  So if you think conscience will make him and his friends stop at some point before you and your family reach conditions materially identical to those experienced by the inhabitants of the Donbass region or if you think that Western Europe is beyond the scope of their plans for engineered collapse just because you wouldn t do something like that you will find that you are wrong  When Europe is in tatters, and its men (whom Soros money helped turn in one lifetime from actual men into effeminized liberal cultural lemmings) are squawking in disbelief as their pampered delusions are shattered in the collapse Soros envisages, Soros will not care  No matter that this is Europe and it is your life under attack this time, and not that of brown people or Eastern Europeans  It won t make any difference  For a psychopath it s simple: you let him do it

"2 Feb, 2016","Gangs, populism, and conspiracy theory overshadow West s role in refugee crisis","In the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, Europe continues to lurch to the right, both in the visible form of neo-Nazi gangs terrorizing the streets, and also with politicians playing to right wing populism  From Stockholm to Dover, gangs have been terrorizing refugees or anyone they perceive to look like one, while also attacking anti-fascist protestors  These gangs by their own admission are reacting to what they perceive to be their own government s failure in responding to the crisis    The fact their governments caused the crisis is a fact which is apparently lost on them  In reality, all these gangs are achieving is to simply play into the hands of the very same governments who happily pipe up about the problems associated with the refugee crisis, while at the same time continue to cause it, with the bombs they drop, and the terror groups and regimes they prop up  Nobody in their right mind wants to see any of the crimes associated with the refugee crisis take place, whether we are taking about wars which cause people to leave their homes, or the problems associated with Europe s inability to deal with the crisis  States in Europe have laws in place to deal with murder, rape, assault, and any other crimes which take place    All of us want to see an end to misogyny and murder wherever it manifests, whether it is committed by groups or individuals, or committed by states on an industrial scale  However, in the current climate, any crime committed by anyone perceived to be a refugee, is immediately brandished in the headlines as proof that all refugees are bad    The same yardstick or measure is not applied to other ethnicities or faiths    If it were, it would probably offer some uncomfortable truths, or reveal the many holes in such pseudo-scientific thinking  The phenomena of street gangs and politicians playing to the right, is a result of Europe and the West reacting to the crisis, rather than taking an honest look at its causes  The way of life many of these groups (and politicians) are talking about protecting , is less to with any Christian values, and is in reality, grounded in propping up the failed economic model of neo-colonial capitalism, which itself is predicated on the continuation of illegal wars and subversion of the Middle East and Africa  In the same way this model has fooled many of the working classes in Britain, themselves victim of this model, into voting for a political party of the ruling class offering them more of the same economic safety ultimately causing their misery under austerity , this thinking has also caused a dangerous form of reactionary nationalism in Europe to resurface  Rather than look at the root cause of the crisis, imperialism, and understand the relationship between war and Western economies, the masses have been duped into believing that the refugee crisis starts and ends with the actual refugees themselves, despite the obvious reasons as to why they have arrived in Europe  This thinking is completely westernized and Eurocentric, and provides a convenient scapegoat for the architects of war: Rather than lay the blame for the crisis at the hands of governments and the neo-colonial institutions which support their interests, the refugees are blamed    Women, children, it makes no difference as newspaper headlines last week show  Or worse still, as we are seeing, more and more people are buying into the idea that a shadowy cabal is behind the crisis, or George Soros and Rothschild Zionists, all intent of course, on destroying Europe s way of life by causing a mass exodus from Africa and the Middle East, to Europe s green pastures  Apart from being untrue, this thinking also reeks of anti-Semitism, and the sort of racism which should remain dead and buried and which needs no revival    It also is very damaging to the left, because it delegitimizes actual progressive thought    The more this thinking occupies the centre ground helped by the media, the further away from a solution we drift  This simplistic scapegoating also diverts away from the fact that it is developed Western economies and the policy which underpins and drives them, which has led to this crisis  There is no conspiracy    It s more like business as usual    The refugee crisis is a direct result of both colonialism and in the modern era, neo-colonialism, the more sophisticated incarnation of modern capitalism, implementing its own barbarism under the perverse justification of humanitarian intervention  In other words, as Europe s thinking goes, It s not enough that we used to occupy and colonize you, you clearly remain incapable of governing yourselves, and so therefore, it is our job to come and do it for you, and to democratize you in the form of bombs and McDonalds    When you come to our shores fleeing our bombs, we will do anything and everything to avoid blaming those who should be blamed including politicians, the wars they advocate, and the consumerism we worship  It is this psychology, or psychological deficiency depending on your view, which underpins the origin of the refugee crisis, and also which now, rather than seeking to diagnose it, will do anything to explain away what is happening-except of course look at the actual cause  No shadowy cabal or conspiracy theory is needed to explain what is happening here    People are fleeing their homelands because there is a very real conspiracy by Western governments and its proxies to destabilize and destroy them  German police should have right to shoot refugees illegally crossing border AfD leaderhttPS: //t co/yrqa1EUDNXpic twitter com/SfYnobWCtO The relationships between Africa, China, and the Middle East are still developing  Russia and China at least, while far from having a perfect relationship with Africa, are at least offering a functional one, and more importantly are perfectly distinguishable one from the West s imperial relationship with Africa and the Middle East  The West s strategy in Africa the Middle East, in the Wake of the Arab Sting , is simply one of divide and ruin , meaning that if we (Western governments) can t control your resources, then no one can  The West would rather destroy whole countries, and turn them into failed states and torch their resources, than allow states to have a functional relationship with each other with indigenous populations benefiting from the wealth  This is how the problem manifests internationally  At home, Europe and the West would rather blame a shadowy cabal, or delude themselves that the others Arabs, Muslims or Africans are the problem rather than their own governments  This is the problem Europe is failing to recognize, which is giving the US also complicit in wars of aggression, a free pass   Until we start to diagnose the problem, rather than engage in right-wing populism and neo-liberal denialism, ugly scenes like those we have seen in Britain, France, and Germany will continue  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/331040-europe-policy-migrants-crisis/

The fact is that Russia s intervention in Syria has blocked the regime-change plans of the Western elite, which is exactly why the likes of George Soros are so angry  Soros wasn t the only George talking twaddle in the Swiss Alps  British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborneaddressed British business leaders at the CBI s lunch, where he hailed the economic achievements of the UK government, and called the UK economy""a chink of light cutting through the global gloom ""Of course Osborne failed to mention the fact that as Chancellor he presided over thelongest drop in real wagesfor over 50 years  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls made headlines when he told the BBC at Davos the quite stunning news that the refugee crisis was destabilizing Europe  He did not of course mention France s role in destabilizing Syria and Libya - and that this destabilization (together with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003) was the major cause of the refugee crisis  Refugees are not destabilising Europe  Europe is destabilising themhttPS: //t co/YMiz7i3h2Ovia@MiddleEastEye Wherever we look at Davos, we see hypocrisy and double standards Oh look, there s the millionaire rock star Bono, the anti-poverty campaigner whose band U2 moved part of their business from Ireland to the Netherlands in order to pay less tax  And who s that giving an interview about the current refugee crisis-triggered by western interventionist policies in the Middle East - why it s the serial interventionist Tony Blair! And who s this impartial observer saying that ""the best result you might be able to get"" in Syria was ""benign Balkanization, benign cantonization""  Why it s Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu!

A: All go to a luxury Swiss resort very yearpic twitter com/0cm9PJSFOj It's worth reflecting on how well the world was doing before Professor Klaus Schwab had his bright idea for a European Management Forum   The 1960s was an era of great economic, social and cultural advances for ordinary people across the globe  These advances continued into the 1970s  The world had never before been so democratic and never before had its wealth been so evenly shared  But starting with the coup which toppled the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and saw him replaced with the capital-friendly dictator and human rights oppressor Augusto Pinochet, the global economic order was restructured in the interests of a tiny but very greedy elite who were unhappy that their share of the cake had shrunk in the genuinely progressive period following World War Two  A hallmark of this neoliberal era has been the way states have been captured to serve the interests of international finance capital and giant global corporations  Publicly owned assets have been privatized, providing rich pickings for the banks and financial institutions who handle the sales  Meanwhile, the very rich have enjoyed generous tax cuts - if they even pay tax at all  Meanwhile, austerity is imposed on the majority  Davos has played a key role in this process  If the World Economic Forum has a habit of coming up with big-business-friendly solutions it s no surprise, as itsmembers""comprise 1,000 of the world s top corporations, global enterprises usually with more than US$5 billion in turnover "" Last week, as the well-heeled attendees arrived in Davos in their private jets, Oxfamreleasedits latest report on global inequality  The report revealed that the richest 1% now own more than the rest of the people in the world combined  A more shocking indictment of forty-odd years of neoliberalism would be hard to find  ""It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super-rich - so few, you could fit them all on a single coach,""says Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB s chief executive  He might also have said we could fit the small group of the global super-rich in one hotel in Davos, which is where most of them probably were last week  We won t get any meaningful change arising from anything proposed at Davos because the iniquitous status quo is in the interest of those who fund the World Economic Forum  To solve the problems of today we need to do away with elite gatherings attended by everyone who matters and re-democratize our politics and our economies  In short, we need to take power away from the billionaires who meet each year at Davos, and return it to the people  Follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005â2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/330046-davos-problem-global-economy-elite/

Yet, when it comes to finding fault with the Russian broadcaster s reporting, the EU s Disinformation Review seems to be coming up short  In their first report, RT gets two bizarre and unrefuted mentions and in the 2nd, the network isn t cited at all  Russian foreign media services are a drop in the ocean compared to their Western competitors  There are literally thousands of them across NATO s 28 member nations  State-funded and their private equivalents  Available on TV, in print, on radio and online  They are broadcasters, think tanks, bloggers, NGOs and so-called citizen journalists  Some of them are extremely well-paid and others do it voluntarily  All of them united in a desire to expose propaganda - the catch-all phrase used to describe anything that contradicts the NATO narrative  This dastardly Russian propaganda is usually defined as content from RT, Sputnik and if Westernmainstream mediais to believed about 50 online trolls   Nevertheless, when forced to actually locate some tangible examples of alleged false reportage or disinformation, they can t find very much  Of course, all media has lapses and bloopers  Especially in a fast-paced 24-hour news environment  It happens to RT, just as it happens toThe New York Timesand theBBCand many others who on occasion might carry a story that turns out not to be 100 percent accurate  The difference, however, is that when RT commits a blooper, it s Russian propaganda - and replayed for years to come - but when American or European outlets bungle, it s a mistake even if it s ever acknowledged, it s forgotten about almost immediately  First announced in March, the EU s Mythbusters team is now publishing weekly updates of its disinformation review  The introductionpromises to show the European public the high amount of such disinformation attacks that target European audience (sic) every single day   This presentation turns out to be a six-page spreadsheet with lots of blank spaces  RT is mentioned twice in Stratcom East s first report  With no explanation as to why the mythbusters find either article offensive  Indeed, the disproof section, which is supposed to explain what s offensive about the piece, and supply facts instead of presumed fiction, is totally blank  In the first article, RTreportedthat the head of Russia s Security Council (Nikolay Patrushev) has warned of a real problem posed by the growing number of US-controlled laboratories that produce biological weapons  Yes, RT reports Patrushev s words  There is no spin on his comments  No opinion whatsoever  It s just a normal news story  Who, what, where and why  Basic journalism  Ivana Smolenova, who highlighted the article, has provided no explanation for why it offends her sensibilities  Maybe she was having a bad day and didn t like the content?

 certain organizations as undesirable must happen only after
 serious joint work of several state agencies, and such moves

 say that we are on the threshold of a third world war,""

 external conflict to distract its population  To avoid disaster, Washington needs to strengthen its economic
 ties with Beijing, according to Soros  The former US diplomat and advisor to the Republican Party, James

 war is possible, but not because of the economy or China s
 currency  Potential conflict could only come from the United
 States poor geopolitical choices that do not benefit the

 is this danger This has nothing to do with the economy, nothing
 to do with currency, and everything to do with very bad American
 geopolitical policy that has alienated the Russians, it is
 alienating the Chinese and pushing the Russian and Chinese closer
 together  This is not in the American interest, Jatras
 said  The idea that the China will deliberately provoke a confrontation
 with an American ally to distract its population if its economy
 has problems in the future is an absurd suggestion, he
 said  The main problem is the US expanding its security presence right
 alongside the vital interest of another rising power for the
 reasons that clearly do not benefit the US  What we really need to do and what Mr  Soros is not talking
 about at all is to reevaluate what our strategic presence in some
 of these regions that are far from the US, but very close to
 China  There is a possibility of confrontation there  The US is strengthening its relationships with certain countries
 not based on what is best for its own economy, but what will best
 contain China  What kind of argument is that? We should be doing things
 that benefit our own country, our own people, our own workers 
 Not because it is going to somehow bottle up China, which I think
 is a dangerous thing to try to do, Jatras said  In some ways I think we are doing in the South China Sea

"23 Mar, 2015", Ruble unstable for artificial reasons ,"The US has created a belief that money would leave Russia, but money doesn t flow out of countries that have extremely low debt and strong export earnings, Paul Craig Roberts, former US Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, told RT  RT:Bloomberg'sarticleindicates that there's investor
 optimism about the future of the Russian economy  What are the
 reasons for that? Paul Craig Roberts:Russia s economy is
 essentially debt-free  Russia has strong export earnings from
 energy  So because of sanctions, these earnings will now be used
 to develop the Russian economy instead of being wasted on imports
 of Western goods  RT:Is it fair to say that, although
 sanctions have hit the Russian economy hard, that they have
 inadvertently helped some Russian firms? PCR:I don t think the sanctions did hurt or hit
 the Russian economy hard; they hit the financial markets because
 they are subject to disruption by Western speculators  The
 sanctions have helped Russian confidence, and more generally, the
 sanctions have helped the overall economy by creating import
 substitution in a process so that the Russians now are starting
 to make more of their own goods rather than use their earnings
 from energy sales to purchase Western goods  This is a very good
 development  Sanctions have helped to develop the Russian
 economy  RT:So are the sanctions doing the damage
 intended by Washington? PCR:Washington said that the purpose of the
 sanctions was to hurt the Russian economy  However, the real
 purpose is to break up the Russian- European political and
 economic relationships  Washington is concerned that those
 developing relationships would eventually pull Europe out of
 Washington s orbit and Washington would lose control  In other
 words its vassal states would become independent because of their
 developing relationships with Russia  So that is the main reason
 for the sanctions  RT:What role has Central Bank policies such
 as amending interest rates and dealing with currency supply
 played in investors' optimistic outlook? PCR:The ruble can be stabilized by Western
 currency speculators  Remember how George Soros destabilized the
 British pound? So what stabilizes the ruble is not the Central
 Bank but its Russia s internal development and Russia s
 disengagement from the West, its economic disengagement from the
 West  The best way to stabilize the ruble is to demand payment in
 rubles for energy exports  As Russia develops its trade with
 China and the BRICS nations the ruble will automatically
 stabilize  As long as you are connected to the Western dollar
 payment system you are subject to destabilization  READ MORE: Russian economy revives despite
 sanctions media RT:How did the rubble decrease affect the
 Russian economy? PCR:The speculators knocking the ruble down
 have raised the price of imports  Therefore this has helped the
 Russia economy  So Russian firms themselves can step in and fill
 more of the Russian demand for goods and services Russia has
 still the smallest ratio of debt to gross domestic product [GDP]
 of any Western country  That is far below anything in Europe or
 the US  So that automatically means a stable ruble  Russia has
 very strong export earnings from natural gas and oil  The only
 reason the ruble is destabilized is because of Washington and the
 currency speculators [Ruble] is a stable currency and has very
 reason to be: very low debt, very strong export earnings, that is
 the mark of stable currency  RT:In your opinion, who is to blame for the
 ruble destabilization? PCR:I don t think the ruble is unstable for
 real economic reasons  It was unstable for artificial reasons  It
 was an environment created by Washington and propaganda  And it
 was created by the belief that all this money would flow out of
 Russia and leave Russia  Generally speaking, money doesn t flow

"1 Feb, 2015", Obama openly admits 'brokering power transition' in Ukraine,"In an interview with CNN s Fareed Zakaria, Barack Obama acknowledged that the United States had ""brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine,"" thus admitting to a high level of democratic impropriety  Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist  He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Before we consider Obama s revealing remarks, and how the
 Ukrainian people sold their country for a song, let s rewind to
 November 2013, when then-President Viktor Yanukovich had shocked
 western capitals - and, more importantly, western markets - by
 suspending plans for an association agreement with the European
 Union  Video:
 /files/opinionpost/37/c1/b0/00/2530092_obana_new mp4 As if on command, thousands of Ukrainians suddenly poured into
 the streets of Kiev to protest the decision  Such a rapid
 reaction should not have come as a surprise  After all, a
 multitude of US government agencies most notably, USAID - had
 been operating in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
 investing billions on its latest""democratic""pet
 project  This is no conspiracy theory  On December 13, 2013, Assistant
 Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, following her third trip to
 Ukraine in five weeks, told the National Press Club:""Since
 Ukraine's independence in 1991 the United States has invested
 over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in needs and other goals "" Exactly what those""other goals""may have been, and who
 helped underwrite them, seem rather obvious today  Although many are tempted to believe otherwise, governments don't
 normally spend such prodigious sums of money in a foreign land
 unless it expects to get something hefty - in this case, Kiev s
 loyalty - in return  Governments are by nature political
 opportunists, not philanthropists, which is precisely why Russia
 gave USAID the boot in 2012  Ukraine did not, and was forced to
 pay the piper, so to speak  We should note here that it was not just US taxpayer dollars that
 unwittingly provided the funds to support the coup d etat in
 Ukraine  In another softball interview with CNN s Zakaria,
 billionaireGeorge Soroslast May coolly admitted: I
 set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent
 of Russia  And the foundation has been functioning ever since and
 played an important part in events now  Certainly those billions of dollars weren t spent just on
 humanitarian work, like distributing pastries to the Ukrainian
 rabble gathered on Independence Square  After all, the crucial
 question as to who would lend Ukraine a multi-billion dollar
 rescue package was the elephant parked on Maidan that few talked
 about  Once upon a time, western financial institutions had the
 market cornered on the lucrative task of bailing out
 cash-strapped countries  Today, however, other economic agencies
 - BRICS for example - are able to compete with the IMF  But after
 Kiev exploded in chaos and violence, the regular lender of last
 resort bagged itself another national trophy for above its
 fireplace  Michael Hudson, of Counterpunch,summed upthe IMF victory:""In April
 2014, fresh from riots in Maidan Square and the February 22 coup,
 and less than a month before the May 2 massacre in Odessa, the
 IMF approved a $17 billion loan program to Ukraine s junta 
 Normal IMF practice is to lend only up to twice a country s quote
 in one year  This was eight times as high "" Hudson said the loan,
 given at a time of civil war, proved that the Washington-based
 financial institution functions as""an arm of US Cold War
 politics "" ""Kiev used the loan for military expenses to attack the
 Eastern provinces, and the loan terms imposed the usual budget
 austerity, as if this would stabilize the country s
 finances "" For anybody who still believes those billions of dollars were
 spent just to prop up democratic institutions need only consider
 the harsh historical lessons from places as diverse and distant
 as South America and the Middle East  Time and again, from Chile
 to Iran, Washington propped up puppet dictatorships to serve its
 purpose  Proving this charge is as simple as eavesdropping on a telephone
 call conversation between Nuland and the US Ambassador to
 Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt  Almost one year ago to the day, Nuland was heard outlining
 Washington s vision of Kiev s future""democratic""structure  Nothing terribly ironic about that, right? While much
 of the amused media focused its attention on Nuland s F*ck
 the EU verbal bomb, that was mere child s play compared to
 the meat of the conversation, which spelled out exactly who
 Washington wanted in power in Kiev  Nuland: I don't think Klitsch
 [Vitaly Klitschko, one of the opposition leaders] should go into
 the government  I don't think it's necessary, I don't think it's
 a good idea  Pyatt:Yeah  I guess    in terms of
 him not going into the government, just let him stay out and do
 his political homework and stuff   Nuland:I think Yats
 [Arseniy Yatseniuk, current prime minister of
 Ukraine]is the
 guy who's got the economic experience, the governing experience 
 He's the    what he needs is Klitsch and Tyagnibok [Oleg
 Tyagnibok, the other opposition leader] on the outside  He needs
 to be talking to them four times a week, you know  I just think
 Klitsch going in    he's going to be at that level working for
 Yatseniuk, it's just not going to work  Pyatt:Yeah, no, I think that's
 right  OK  Good  Do you want us to set up a call with him as the
 next step? Or, instead of enduring the obscenities of a Nuland conversation,
 one could simply wait for Barack Obama to sum it all up in an
 interview with CNN all-star softball pitcher Fareed Zakaria  Instead of challenging Obama on the question as to whether
 US-NATO policies in Eastern Europe - which, aside from moving
 inexorably eastward to Russia s border, also excludes Russian
 participation in the US missile defense shield - have in some
 substantial way contributed to the deterioration of relations
 between Russia and the US, Zakaria merely dangles the Russian aggressor carrot before Obama, who of course
 blames the entire mess on Putin, while admitting to something
 incredible, yet entirely believable  READ MORE: US envoy to Ukraine caught posting
 fake images on Twitter Obama told CNN's Zakaria that Washington had brokered a deal
 to transition power in Ukraine""following on the heels of
 the deadly protests on Maidan and Yanukovich then
 fleeing  [Interview segment available in above
 video]  While Nuland s colorful conversation one year ago told us
 everything we needed to know about Ukraine s so-called democratic
 transition, it s a completely different thing when the deal is admitted to by none other than the American
 president  Washington power brokers, desensitized to the concept of
 brokering political deals due to their so-called
 democratic work in faraway war zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
 Libya, think it normal operating procedure to employ the strategy
 inside of sovereign states that are experiencing internal
 discord  The real tragedy of such a scenario is not so much that it is
 happening, but that the United States, and the Ukrainian people,
 it seems, believe that a foreign invasion of political
 opportunists on their territory constitutes democracy or will
 somehow lead to democracy  I'd wager to bet that Ukraine will
 very soon resemble Greece, where the people had firsthand
 experience with foreign-enforced austerity measures and,
 employing real democratic procedure as opposed to backroom
 brokered deals, introduced real democracy to elect politicians of
 the people, for the people and by the people  But then again, the United States expected no less from the $5
 billion, and a few cakes, it paid for Kiev s pledge of
 allegiance  Now the Ukrainian people must dutifully follow that
 foreign-built road wherever it may lead them  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/228379-obama-power-transition-ukraine/

"31 Oct, 2014", Moscow ends up at risk with Ukraine gas agreement ,"It is not clear what Moscow gets out of a deal with Ukraine by selling gas below market price, and guaranteeing supplies to Europe while there are still sanctions and anti-Russian propaganda, Paul Roberts, former Assistant US Treasury Secretary, told RT  RT:How important is thisdealfor Ukraine and Europe? Paul Roberts: It is not clear what the Russian government gets
 out of it  They have agreed to sell gas to Ukraine at a
 subsidized price, far below the market price  And yet Ukraine
 continues to carry on propaganda against Russia, continues to
 attack the Russian population in eastern and southern Ukraine  Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU-Russia-Ukraine gas agreement: I don t think [the IMF] had
 any choice  They didn t want to get down this road  But the
 alternative would have been absolutely awful: it would have
 been large parts of Europe without gas come the middle of
 winter, and that would have been utter and complete disaster  RT:But getting away from those attacks how
 significant is this deal for Europe and for Ukraine, did they
 walk away winners in this? PR:Of course Europe and Ukraine walks away and
 Russia is a loser  Here you have Russia subsidizing the countries
 that are imposing sanctions on it, trying to destroy Russia  RT:Some experts say that Russia is a winner
 in this situation? Do you agree with that? Is this a good price
 for gas? PR:Why is a hundred dollars below the market
 price a good price? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
 Russia will ever be paid  If they are not going to be paid, what
 are they going to do? They are going to cut off the gas in the
 middle of the winter so that Washington propaganda can say: Look at these evil Russians, they are starving, freezing
 Ukrainians, the gas is cut off! I don t think Russians
 understand what they are dealing with  Washington is far more
 devious and sophisticated then Russia can comprehend  This is not
 that Russia has a chance  Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU-Russia-Ukraine gas agreement: Ukraine is broken largely
 because the EU broke it through the policies it has followed
 over the last year, and now Europe has to pay for that I don t
 think financially they are very happy about it, but
 realistically, what choice did they have  RT:But it is not Ukraine that is going to
 pay this money to Russia  The EU and IMF have said they're ready
 to finance Kiev's debt to Russia  But the Ukrainian economy is in
 tatters  Can they expect to get the money back? PR:If the IMF pays the Ukrainian bills it takes
 it back out of Ukraine  This is not a gift to Ukraine  If the
 Ukrainian economy blows up - which is likely to be the case the
 IMF sees it is not going to be paid because Ukraine can t pay 
 Russians won t be paying  RT:Russia is having economic problems of
 its own  Is this agreement a positive step for Moscow too? PR:I think Moscow ends up at risk with this
 agreement  Washington is very interested in doing all the damage
 it possibly can to Russia because Russia is a potential check on
 Washington s hegemony over the world  So for all the prices
 falling is good as far as Washington is concerned  I think it is
 foolish for the Russians to let their currency be traded at
 foreign exchange markets because Washington can attack the ruble
 and the exchange markets and drive it down  Just as George Soros
 did  One person was able to destroy the British pound  Washington
 can easily destroy the ruble  I still don t think Russians
 understand what they are up against; they are not really in the
 game  Vladimir Putin is a good leader and he gives good speeches,
 but he doesn't seem to be able to prevent the continuing assaults
 on Russia  Despite giving Ukraine a subsidized gas price, despite
 Russia guaranteeing energy supplies to Europe in the winter,
 there is no reduction in sanctions, there is no stop in the
 propaganda against Russia  In fact the propaganda has increased
 because Washington is afraid that Russia might gain some
 advantage from treating Ukraine in such a kind way  What is
 Russia gaining out of this? It is not getting anything  Here is
 Russia with a power to turn energy off in Europe  It doesn t use
 it, it doesn t say to these countries in Europe: Look, if
 you are going to put sanctions on us, if you are not going to
 have an independent foreign policy, if you are going to follow
 Washington s orders - we don t sell gas to NATO members  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/201135-gas-ukraine-russia-eu-price/
"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev-controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta's desperate quest for legitimacy  Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military final solution for the east  In 2001, the Austrian
 economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled Democracy:
 The God that Failed , in which he among other things 
 compared the process of voting to a religious ritual  Just as the
 ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
 ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
 kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity  In his
 study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
 monarchies actually safeguarded peoples' lives and liberty far
 more than democracy has before making a case for outright
 anarchy  Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
 democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
 home  Western leaders routinely speak of democracy as a
 virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as rooted in the sanctity of the individual (BH Obama in
 Talinn, September 2014)  In actuality, democracy is simply a
 decision-making process in which the majority gets its way  The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they liberate , however, democracy means whatever the
 liberators say it means  Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
 independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not democratic 
 because the High Priesthood in the West says so while the
 violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was midwifed by Washington (per V Nuland's famous phone
 call)  Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
 junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
 against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem  Its prime
 minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
 Americans ( Yats is our guy, to quote Nuland again) 
 Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
 presidential vote in May  By the time it was held, Donetsk and
 Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
 their separation  Even so, the junta's Western backers proclaimed
 Petro Poroshenko elected on May 25 as the legitimate leader
 of Ukraine  Quite unlike the aggressor and invader it was
 accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
 Poroshenko launched an all-out war against the two eastern
 regions  That war was lost  Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
 lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
 battalions such as Azov have terrorized any civilians
 they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
 have failed  Hence all the crying about Russian
 invasion to the Western press, but also the coming general
 election  That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
 sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
 they are democratic , and thus worth backing  More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
 nine months, this weekend's vote will showcase the absurdity of democracy as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic 
 What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
 procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
 up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
 acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
 between the Nationalist-Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
 boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko  And with
 every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis 
 not the neo variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind 
 that triangle keeps getting smaller  Recent polls - by the Western-funded Democratic Initiatives
 Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post suggest a significant
 lead for President Poroshenko's party, followed by Lyashko's
 Radicals and Yatsenyuk's People's Front  Meanwhile, the
 formerly-ruling Party of Regions and the Communists 
 intimidated, brutalized and all-but-banned are polling in
 single digits  However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
 they were undecided , which suggests they are either
 afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven't yet decided on the
 lesser of evils  Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
 under Kiev's control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
 their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
 Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open
 for business  But the liberators themselves won't get
 to vote; for whatever reason, the junta's legislature failed to
 pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front  Meanwhile, the civil society organizations funded for
 years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy
 lists OPORA as one of its aid recipients in 2009) to create
 fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
 violations of campaign rules  Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
 already reported over 527 violations, including at least 80
 cases of alleged voter bribery  They either haven't got the
 memo about how this election should be a showcase of democratic 
 Ukraine versus the authoritarian Russia, or they did
 get the memo, and are significantly under-reporting voter
 intimidation and manipulation  For their part, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics are refusing to
 go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
 November 7  They may not have a chance to hold them  There isn't
 much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
 artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by  A
 renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
 idea, but the junta's generals have certainly demonstrated
 greater stupidity over the course of the campaign  When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several
 Serb-majority areas refused to accept Zagreb's rule  The Croatian
 government, backed by Germany, initially failed to conquer these
 areas, and accepted a UN-guaranteed armistice (Vance Plan)  Four
 years later, backed by the US, Zagreb launched an all-out assault
 and reintegrated the territories by force, expelling
 some 200,000 Serbs that lived there  Poroshenko's adviser Yury
 Lutsenko openly stated back in September that Kiev ought to
 follow Croatia's example in regard to the Donbass  The democratic West said nothing  After all, what
 Croatia did was a democracy too  Because in the eyes of Western
 governments, the word means whatever they say it means, nothing
 more and nothing less  To borrow from Lewis Carrol's description
 of logic in Behind the Looking Glass , The question is

 morning news served up to strike fear and loathing  A thousand

 Europe, of gleaming scimitars slicing the air, and a rerun of
 those twin towers plummeting, down, down, down  But this is a
 time of WikiLeaks, the NSA spies, lies, deceit, and misdirect 
 You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
 blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
 brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
 greed, graft, and mediocre leaders  The fact is ISIS, the Arab
 Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
 Washington policy under Obama  This cannot be repudiated, but it
 can be reasoned  In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr  Ahmed Bensaada
 assembles a body of evidence that the so-called Arab Spring was a
 destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
 the US State Department and historically CIA-funded foundations
 for so-called freedom  No, you c1985annot use the he s one
 of them excuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
 Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
 Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
 Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
 Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
 reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
 Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
 Development (USAID)  and George Soros Open Society Institute
 (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce  Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
 that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary  The hierarchy
 and system behind him might be the anti-Christ  As proof the system of thought in the west it corrupted, let s look
 at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment  McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
 industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime s Senatorial
 superhero  While some of us would like to classify his brand of
 Neo-conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
 presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
 witness to systematic abuses  Case in point, McCain is head of an
 organization known as the International Republican Institute
 (IRI)  That institution s stated goal is to; advance
 democracy worldwide but the how, the spread,
 and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us  The
 good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
 analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
 Department  Recently IRI worked with the U S  Middle East Partnership
 Initiative (MEPI)  The point here is, in many instances where
 Arab Spring or seeming anti-Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
 organizations like McCain s IRI are somehow present  This quote
 from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute s
 (IRI) Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership project 
 This project supports independent democratic political activists
 and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
 dialogue  IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
 Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
 research to key partners, stakeholders, civil society
 representatives and influential decision makers  But still further inside American geo-strategizing, the
 aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
 utter decay of thinking  Thisreportentitled, On Strategic
 Non-Violent Change, by one of the world s leading
 insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
 blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
 corporations  Helvey s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
 into insurrectionists are well known  But his recent coming out
 over Ukraine s recent coup d Ã©tat, this is lesser
 known  Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
 wrong is with us  While most of us know we love peace, the rest
 of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
 killers  It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
 guide for a kind of governing  This guide has been in practice in
 Washington for some decades now  Much has been written about
 Machiavelli s The Prince, but this quote reveals the
 essence of Machiavellian intent: The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
 world consists chiefly of the vulgar  - Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
 belief  Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
 Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
 by untimely anti-Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
 from the west Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
 Peace and Prosperity calls the West s subversion of the Ukraine
 peace process by NATO a grand deception  But beyond
 just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
 of editorials for peace  There simply is no anti-war sentiment, not in the press  To sum up here, you don t have to have a PhD in political science
 to understand Machiavellian intentions  The Italian philosopher
 outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
 congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a prince or dictator  Power, as such, was outlined as
 ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise 
 The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
 mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
 makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
 us today  Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
 of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize  The continual
 stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
 Machiavelli s principles, as do Obama s grand schemes for health
 care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare  In a
 nutshell, Obama s advisers are political scientists of the first
 order  To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey s Einstein Institute piece
 again; A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
 obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
 public  Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
 huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli  London, Berlin and
 Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
 reason  But in studying NiccolÃ² di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
 you ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
 practice the kingly game  What s important for us all is the
 purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism  Has America
 acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
 intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
 leave to you  As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
 Shelley s modern Prometheus is upon us  We have this passage from
 Frankenstein: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
 make peace with all  I have love in me the likes of which you can
 scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not
 believe  If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the

"16 Sep, 2014"," Carl Bildt - slavish supporter of US, not European values ","Sweden s Foreign Minister Carl Bildt - whether it is for personal self-benefit or because of general ideology -100 percent supports American policies almost without question, journalist Bryan MacDonald told RT  Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia  He has written for RT since 2014  Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail  Follow him on Twitter@27khv The Parliamentaryelectionsin Sweden, which took place on
 September 14, signaled the return of a left-leaning government
 after eight years in opposition  The change of government in
 Sweden also means an end of the mandate of one of the well-known
 lawmakers in the European political arena - Foreign Minister Carl
 Bildt  Bildt has been a fierce critic of Russia over its politics
 in Ukraine  RT:Bildt was one of the people behind the
 Eastern partnership - the initiative governing the EU's relations
 with post-soviet states  Some argue, this policy is partly to
 blame for the current chaos in Ukraine, would you agree? Bryan MacDonald:It definitely played a large
 part, but it wouldn t exclusively have led to this of course 
 There are other factors such as Ukrainian internal politics,
 movements and of course interference of the US, NATO and
 non-government bodies such as George Soros and Pierre Omidyar 
 But certainly the Eastern Partnership is one of the bulwarks, and
 of course Carl Bildt was one of the main supporters of it  A
 partnership that has completely transformed the EU from a core
 group of 15 relatively rich West European countries to a group of
 27 where most of the group are poor  RT:He served on the Board of Directors of
 Lundin Oil, during the Civil war in Sudan  The company was
 accused of providing resources to government forces that
 committed crimes against humanity  How did that affect his
 reputation in Sweden? BM:I don t think people in Europe are really
 aware of that  I think Bildt in Europe was mainly famous for his
 behavior in the Balkans and Ukraine this year, and his general
 support of what we call eurocratic politics, which is
 where the elite within Europe, every country almost, with a few
 exceptions of course, seem to care more about the European
 project then the actual people who live in Europe at the moment 
 That is one of the reasons he has been in the news here, I don t
 think Sudan is such a big issue in Europe itself amongst the
 normal voting public  RT:Bildt worked with the Committee for the
 liberation of Iraq pushing for the invasion of the country  How
 big of a role did the organization play in the conflict? BM:Again, like with the Ukraine situation, it s
 one of many groups that played a role in conflict  Obviously the
 biggest role in the conflict was played by George Bush and Tony
 Blair by their bombing of Iraq  Of course it played a role and
 Bildt is a notorious neo-con, but the real question here is that
 Bildt is a slavish supporter of what we call American values
 which are not necessarily in train with what we call European
 values  Most Europeans, not all, but especially countries like
 France, in the Nordic countries and Ireland, would be suspicious
 of America s actions and would have a very different world view
 to the US  Bildt is not; Bildt is for whatever reason, maybe his
 personal self-benefit or general ideology, 100 percent supports
 American policies without almost any question  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/188136-bildt-sweden-eastern-partnership/
"12 Aug, 2014", Sovereign debt for territory: A new global elite swap strategy,"In recent decades, dozens of sovereign nations have fallen into ever-deepening trouble by becoming indebted with the private megabank over-world for amounts far, far in excess of what they can ever pay back  Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant  Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op-ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda RepÃºblica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda RepÃºblica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant  Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op-ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda RepÃºblica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda RepÃºblica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Is this due to bankers professional malpractice coupled with
 government mismanagement on a truly grand scale? Or are we seeing
 global power elite long-term planners slowly achieving their
 goals? Recurrent sovereign debt crises reflect neither over-lending
 mistakes by bankers and investors, nor innocence on the part of successive governments in deeply indebted nations  Rather, it all ties in with a global model for domination driven
 by a system of perpetual national debt which Ihave called The Shylock Model   As with the tango which requires rhythm and bravado, Argentina is
 again dancing centre-stage to global mega-bankers financial
 tunes after falling into a new technical default   Not
 just because the country is unable to pay off its massive public
 debt by heeding the rules of the game as written and
 continuously re-vamped by global usurers, but now with added
 legal immorality and judicial indecency on the part of New York s
 Second District Manhattan Court presided by Judge Daniel Griesa  Griesa has shown no qualms in putting US law at the service of
 immoral parasitic bankers and investors such as Paul
 Singer of the Elliott/NML Fund and Mark Brodsky of the Aurelius
 Fund  The mainstream media inside and outside Argentina refer to these
 parasitic money sloshers as vulture funds ;
 a conceptual mistake because one might then be led to believe
 that other funds and bankers - Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citigroup,
 JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, George Soros, Rothschild, Warburg
 - are not vultures when, in fact, the very foundations
 of today s global banking system lie on parasitic pro-vulture
 rules and laws coupled with an overpowering lack of moral values  Sovereign debts are a major problem in just about every country
 in the world, including the US, UK and EU nations  So much so,
 those debts have become a Damocles Swords threatening the
 livelihood of untold billions of workers around the world  One often wonders why governments indebt themselves for so much
 more than they can ever hope to pay Here, Western economists,
 bankers, traders, Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel
 laureates and the mainstream media have a quick and monolithic
 reply: because all nations need investment and
 investors if they wish to build highways, power plants,
 schools, airports, hospitals, raise armies, service
 infrastructures and a long list of et ceteras, economic and
 national activities are all about  But more and more people are starting to ask a fundamental
 common-sense question: why should governments indebt themselves
 in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
 mega-bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
 and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their
 own local sovereign currency instead? Here is where all the above experts go berserk &
 ballistic, shouting back: Issue currency? Are you crazy??
 That s against the rules & laws of economics!!! Issuing
 national sovereign currency to finance the real economy s
 monetary needs leads to inflation and lost jobs and chaos and 
 (puts us nice mega-bankers out of a job )!!  That s when
 they all gang-up into noisy The sky is falling! The sky is
 falling!! mode  Then you ask them: What happens when countries default on their
 unpayable sovereign debts - as they invariably and repeatedly do
 - not just in Argentina, but in Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, France,
 Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Portugal, Russia, Bolivia,
 Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and
 Indonesia? Again the voice of the experts : Then countries
 must restructure their debts kicking them forwards 20, 40 or
 more years into the future, so that your great, great, great
 grandchildren can continue paying them   Oh, I see! The truth is that countries need public spending to maintain
 their economies resilient and buoyant, their citizens working,
 prospering and happy; their nation-states sovereign, strong and
 secure  OK: happy, secure and working populations cannot be defined as a
 formula that can be readily integrated into expert economists spreadsheets  However, there s a basic truth that
 should be obvious by now: Finance (which is the virtual world of
 bankers, investments, speculation and usury) should always be
 fully subordinated to the Real Economy (which is the world of
 work, production, buildings, milk & bread and services)  All this begs the obvious question: Since governments have a
 natural tendency to overspend and end up getting themselves into
 too much debt, which is the better option then: - that their red numbers (aka sovereign debt) should
 be owed to themselves; their own nation-states (debt in local
 currency that in the last instance can be written off, even if a
 bad bout of inflation cannot be stopped, countries can always
 revamp their currencies as Argentina repeatedly did over the past
 forty years), whereby the whole debt crisis basically
 becomes a short-term internal affair (albeit painful!), or - to convert those red numbers into foreign currency
 debt (US Dollars or Euro) fully controlled by powerful far-away,
 well-organized creditor-technocrats and global mega-bankers
 sitting at the FED and IMF in Washington DC; the European Central
 Bank in Frankfurt; or perched in eager expectation in their Wall
 Street vulture nests? This tongue-twister, which famously proved too much for Baby Bush
 to muster, is a fitting description of how the hellish sovereign
 debt system really works in the long-term  Argentina s recurrent defaults and debt restructuring go back
 many decades  For brevity s sake, let s just point to 1956 right
 after President Juan Domingo PerÃ³n was ousted by a very bloody
 1955 US-UK (and mega-banker) sponsored military coup  PerÃ³n was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina
 with the mega-bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all
 of Argentina s sovereign debt  So, once the mega-bankers got rid
 of him in 1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created
 the Paris Club to engineer decades-worth of sovereign
 debt for vanquished Argentina, something they ve been doing until
 today  But each sovereign-debt crisis cycle became shorter, more
 virulent and more toxic  By December 2001, Argentina had collapsed financially sinking
 into the largest sovereign debt default in history  Immediately,
 the IMF s deputy manager Anne Krueger proposed some new and
 creative ideas on what to do about Argentina  She published them in 2002 in an article on the IMF s website: Should Countries like Argentina be able to declare
 themselves bankrupt? , in which she said that the
 lesson is clear: we need better incentives to bring debtors and
 creditors together before manageable problems turn into
 full-blown crises , adding that the IMF believes this
 could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy regimes like
 Chapter 11 in the US   She pointed this out as a possible new approach ,
 adding that of course many practical and political obstacles
 to getting such an approach up and running needed to be
 overcome, the key features would need the force of law
 throughout the world , creating a predictable (global)
 legal framework   From the stance of global mega-bankers geopolitical long-term
 planners, Ms Krueger s proposal consisted of first gradually
 driving countries into receivership, and then sequentially into
 full-fledged bankruptcy  Then as if nations were private corporations like Enron or
 WorldCom - they could be broken up into as many digestible pieces as possible, to be gobbled up by
 international creditors in some global vulture-fest banquet  These ideas were developed in greater detail in her IMF essay, A New Approach to Debt Restructuring , and in a Foreign Affairs (mouthpiece of the powerful New
 York-Based Elite think-tank, Council on Foreign Relations)
 article published in July/August 2002 by Harvard professor
 Richard N Cooper: Chapter 11 for Countries   Here, Cooper very matter-of-factly recommends that only if
 the debtor nation cannot restore its financial health are its
 assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed to its creditors 
 again under the guidance of a (global) court (!)  During those turbulent years, the global press Time and The New
 York Times, for example even suggested that the immensely rich
 Patagonia southern region should secede from Argentina as a
 defaulted debt payment mechanism  In June 2005, however, a new sovereign debt bond mega-swap was
 instrumented by Argentina s new president, Nestor Kirchner, and
 his Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna  However, as Argentina became more and more structurally mired in
 debt, its sovereign debt crisis cycle grew shorter and shorter so
 that by 2010 a new debt crisis was in the books involving yet
 more debt reengineering, this time by President Cristina Kirchner
 and her Economy Minister (and today prosecuted Vice President)
 Amado Boudou  But that too failed to hold for long, and today Singer s
 NML/Elliot Fund and Brodsky s Aurelius Fund have pushed Argentina
 again into default, this time with the legal backing of local
 Manhattan Federal Judge Griesa and the US Supreme Court  The very fact that today the fate of Argentina s sovereign debt
 lies with the US Judiciary is an eloquent sign of things to come  Surprisingly, Ms Krueger recently came out in defense of Argentina recommending Judge Griesa and his Vulture
 Nest boys should not act hastily killing off the Argentine
 hen that lays golden eggs  In an article published July 2014, she warns that the US
 Supreme Court s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle, and may
 very well further increase the risk attached to holding sovereign
 debt and this, to the cost of issuing it  The specialized and mainstream media - Financial Times, New York
 Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist - are also recommending
 Judge Griesa and his vulture chicks to show more restraint
 because in today s delicate post-2008 banking system, a new and
 less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart the global
 elite s plans for an orderly transition towards a new global
 legal architecture that will allow orderly liquidation of
 financially-failed states like Argentina  Especially if such debt
 were to be collateralized by its national territory (what else is
 left!?) Will yet another sovereign debt bond mega-swap be imposed upon
 Argentina, this time with large swathes of its national territory
 especially Patagonia being used as collateral guarantee? That would mean that in a few years time the Shylocks in Wall
 Street and London will do everything they can to yet again push
 Argentina into default, since that would pave the way for them to legally take over its territory cashing in on their
 collateral as compensation   Remember: usurer Shylock drooled at the mouth whilst sharpening
 his knife preparing to cut deep into Merchant Antonio s heart  He
 didn t give a damn about the 3000 ducats owed him: he just wanted
 the pound of flesh legally his  Is this what the coming Sovereign Debt Model will look
 like? If we tie this all in with what the unfolding of Act
 III in the on-goingIsrael-Palestine crisiswhereby re-settling
 millions of Israeli civilians into southern Argentina might be on
 the drawing board, we can then begin to understand how nicely
 Argentina s next debt crisis will tie in: The global
 Rothschild s, Warburg s, Lazard s, Soros, Rockefellers will be
 able to legally take over Patagonia, and then legally hand it over to whomever they wish without a
 single shot being fired! If this is what s really happening behind-the-curtains regarding
 Argentina, does anybody believe it will stop there? Beware Greece, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Korea,
 Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa the world government is
 marching in!

"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to voluntarily commit suicide ,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT s Truthseeker  RT:Could you
 summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
 IMF loans, to Ukraine's best assets ending up in private Western
 hands - the IMF's 'knee-breaker' role as you memorably described
 it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
 mind is that finance today is war by non-military means  The aim
 of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
 ending up with its property  The main property to obtain is that
 which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange  For
 Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
 companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
 oligarchs  For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
 these assets and their revenue into foreign hands in an economy
 whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
 of the failed post-1991 restructuring  That is where the IMF
 comes in  The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
 deficits  Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
 mainly to maintain a country s exchange rate  The effect usually
 is to subsidize flight capital out of the country at a high
 exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
 dollars or euro  In Ukraine s case, foreign creditors would
 include Gazprom, which already has been paid something  The IMF
 transfers a credit to its Ukraine account, which then
 pays foreign creditors  The money never really gets to Ukraine or
 to other IMF borrowers  It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
 including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
 Greece  Such loans come with conditionalities that
 impose austerity  This in turn drives the economy even further
 into debt forcing the government to tighten the budget even
 more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
 assets  RT:Can Ukraine expect the so-called'IMF
 effect'of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
 to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
 to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants 
 remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP  (About $10 billion a
 year ) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
 Western Europe  The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
 more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work  They will send
 some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
 Ukrainian currency vis-Ã -vis the ruble and euro  RT:How are the IMF's tools in reality
 weapons of mass destruction as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
 austerity and unemployment  The result is a downward economic
 spiral  Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues  So governments are
 told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets 
 mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
 extract economic rent  The effect is to turn the economy into a
 renting tollbooth economy  Hitherto free public roads
 are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
 sewer systems also are privatized  This raises the cost of
 living, and hence the cost of labor while overall wage levels
 are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
 raises unemployment  RT:The IMF's perhaps also a weapon of mass
 destruction in a more literal sense  The organization has
 publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
 're-design' its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
 Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting 
 Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
 instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF s conditionality is that
 it pacify the East  Pacification may occur violently
 in today s Orwellian rhetoric  The only way in which actual
 political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
 federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
 kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West  As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
 the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
 prosecuted the IMF  All that voters can do is reject governments
 submitting to IMF conditionalities  Many voters who are able will vote with their feet and simply leave the sinking
 economy  So the IMF s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
 are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered 
 Austerity is ultimately a policy nobody is holding gun to their
 head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
 in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it  In this
 sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago  RT:Everyone knows austerity's effects on
 Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don't want it;
 even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn't work  Why will
 Ukraine's leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
 job in the West when they've voted out or something? MH:Ukraine s leaders are mainly kleptocrats 
 Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
 their own power  George Soros has written that their best way to
 do this is to find Western partners  This will provide US and
 European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
 economy  Western support will provide more IMF and European
 lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
 can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
 banks  RT:Do you think that the EU isn't stupid
 enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one-sided
 association agreement, member states will just strip the country
 of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
 Ukraine's 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
 member  One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
 German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)  Ukraine has rich Western land,
 and that part of the country is largely still rural  Foreign
 investors would like to buy it out and re-feudalize it, creating large business farms  But the EU is unlikely to
 provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
 investment in Western European agriculture  The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
 benefit from its inexpensive labor  Wrecking the economy
 Greek-style or Irish-style or Latvian-style is sufficient to send
 its workers to the West  And the most mobile traditionally are
 the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
 languages and with skills in demand in the West  RT:You noted Ukraine 'must have asked the
 US first' before blowing up that gas pipeline  Do you think NATO
 will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
 less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
 waging a big PR campaign in Europe  MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
 economy much more high-cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
 in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange  The NATO
 rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
 Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine won t continue
 subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
 Russia can arm itself against us [with this money]  The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
 manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
 defend itself  And without purchasing foreign technology and
 without large state subsidy as US and European governments
 provide their own economies Russia cannot create a
 manufacturing economy  So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
 earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
 that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
 military power my potentially be used to achieve political
 independence from the US sphere  RT:Anything else you would like to
 add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
 throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
 power of elected governments, and hence of democracy  Governments
 are sovereign  No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
 or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
 state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
 war  At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
 financial oligarchy, or elected governments  The two sets of aims
 are antithetical: rising living standards and national
 independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international
 dependency  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/170960-economy-imf-ukraine-oligarchs/
"20 Jun, 2014",Intl Energy Forum head - EU's energy independence dreams won't be realized anytime soon,"Ukraine is refusing to pay its energy bills, and Moscow turns off the taps there is now a real concern another gas war is going on, and it may get out of hand  The game for energy has too many players locked in it Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and the US but who will suffer the consequences if things go wrong and the agreement is not reached? Can shale gas save the day? We ask these questions to the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum  Aldo Flores-Quiroga is on Sophie&Co today  Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Aldo Flores-Quiroga, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, welcome to the show  It s great to have you with us  I m going to start from the latest: Europe wants energy independence what do you think, can it ever achieve that goal when it has no significant natural energy reserves of its own? Is it something doable? Aldo Flores-Quiroga:Energy independence as a concept on its own is a very weak concept for pursuing energy policy  No country is energy independent, and it s very unlikely that anyone can achieve that  The world of energy is one of interdependence, it s a message we constantly emphasize in the context of producer-consumer dialog conducted under the IEF  SS: You know how Europe is dependent on Russian gas it seems something of a clichÃ©  Is it really Russia or the transit countries that is causing the problems? I mean, Russia is a reliable supplier; it has never halted the flow of gas to Europe  It only had to reroute the gas when Ukraine would stop the transit AFQ:Look, this goes beyond whether countries are causing or not problems  The structure of long-term, safe, reliable trade between countries requires a commitment of many players  In the energy dialogue we have learned that security of demand is as important as security of supply  And what we re seeing now in the context of Russian-European trade and Ukraine as a transit country is a responsible behavior from all sides  There s conversation going on, which is the right approach when there is a divergence of views, and we welcome this very much  Of course issue is not simple, but to the extent that the interested parties are participating in this dialog, it should be welcomed by everyone  SS: :OK, but now we have a special situation on our hands  There is a civil war going on in Ukraine  Russia is Europe s biggest gas supplier  Now half of the gas flow to Europe is passing through Ukraine  Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? AFQ:Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? SS: Yeah, because, you know, it s an unusual situation right now in Ukraine  It s beyond just being a safe supplier or safe transit route, there is a civil war going on in the country  AFQ:Again, the fundamental component of any country s energy policy involves diversification  Suppliers and demanders, producers and consumers always have to have diversification as one of the objectives of energy policy if they want to enhance the energy security  The fact that European countries have pursued a policy of diversification, the fact that Russia itself is pursuing a policy of diversification, both of energy sources and of markets: it s just a sensible policy regardless of the circumstances  SS: But if we talk in terms of today, not in one year or two or three years, but, like, today the way things are looking right now, remembering 2006 and 2009 Ukraine was late with its gas payments and intercepted Europe-bound Russian gas  Could that happen again right now? AFQ:The first thing to keep in mind is that we re in a different world right now from 2009  Europe has made investments in diversification, Russia has also approached this with a mindset of diversification, investments that it has done to go with Europe now are looking towards markets in the East, and there is also a stronger political infrastructure, to call it somehow, to address this issue, so we re not exactly facing the same situation  And investments in diversification involved not only the inter-connectedness in Europe, but new markets Europe is set to increase its energy imports, as we have also seen  Russia, as I have said, is looking for markets elsewhere and this should strengthen the energy security for all interested parties  SS: OK, but talking of diversification, you would think that the South Stream pipeline project would have taken care of many things it would be so beneficial to Europe; but then you see Bulgaria all of a sudden halting its construction  What do you think happened there? What went wrong? AFQ:As usual in this cases, it is never simple to bring all the various interests to coincide  That s why investments in gas are long-term usually they take a sometimes protracted negotiation process, and what we re seeing is precisely that  It s not necessarily easy to bring this many countries and companies to agree on what is a best approach to these very sizeable investments  SS: Look, I m not insinuating anything AFQ:Now, that said, it is of course important that there s a responsible behavior from all sides, producers consumers and transit countries, and, well, the fact that there are complications, does not imply that there is an irresponsible behavior per se  There are just various points of view that have to be made compatible in the process of these negotiations  SS: And every country has the right to decide on its own whether they want to be part of a pipeline project, or not  But if Russian gas was no longer available, what alternatives are there? For example, Norway s Statoil announced it could increase gas supplies to the European Union, but it just wouldn t be enough in terms of quantity to make up for all of the Russian gas  So, what are the alternatives as of today? AFQ:First of all, I would not start from that premise  I don t think that the Russian gas will not be available  Second, let s keep in mind that gas consumption as such of total energy consumption in Europe is 5 percent  This means that Europe is diversified and has options, and together with new measures that are being taken in Europe, approaches to diversify like I have said their energy needs and their sources of gas supply, I don t see a scenario of any major disruption and I do see that Europe has many options on the table to deal with any situation  Europe has a diversified energy system, even taking into account that Russia is such an important gas supplier to Europe  SS: And can the US make up any shortfall in energy supplies for Europe? AFQ:Well, that s a question that everyone is asking, what s going to be the impact of the unconventionals revolution as it is now called, the rise of production of gas in the US, of oil and gas in the rest of the world, and gas markets in general  We have yet to see many other developments unfold before we can say with any certainty how it s going to happen  Right now, the main project is for LNG export in the US from the Gulf coast  It appears to be dedicated to supply both Asia and Europe, but it is just one of many projects, it may not have the size right now for anyone to suggest that this will make up for shortfalls in the supply  Again, this is a much more complex subject with many players, with many suppliers  What is clear, of course, is that to the extent that exports from the US to Europe or from any other country for that matter to Europe are sustained or increased, this will also enhance the energy security in Europe  SS: I remember European Commission president JosÃ© Manuel Barroso saying that the EU can t create the illusion that gas from the US is going to solve all of its problems, and there are so many different estimates of how much it could take, but in your personal opinion what s your estimate? How much time does the US need to put their shale gas export into action? AFQ:Now, that s quite speculative  We know that there is one project approved in the US, and there are many more on different levels of probability being explored, so it is unclear  And moreover, the US is increasing its own demand for its own gas, so it is too soon to tell, in my view  SS: But you know how people like to speculate, and when we announced that we re having you on our program, it was going to be about gas, there is this viewer of ours who sent us this question he is asking, is there any weight to the idea that this Russian-Ukraine gas conflict is being stirred up by the US, and it is to force Europe to switch suppliers? AFQ:Well that s just pure speculation  I certainly don t agree with that point of view  Let me insist, there are serious issues with serious players and actors and governments and companies  The idea that with the amount of resources involved, the size of investments that are behind the oil and gas industry, and the very important relationships between states that this type of simplistic mindset would be used anyway, it s just hard to imagine  SS: I do want to continue talking about this whole shale gas revolution, because Europe and Ukraine have shale gas reserves, and they are untapped  Now, is the crisis situation going to advance their development what do you think? AFQ:Well, we have seen that any disruption to energy flows does increase attention to policies of diversification, and fracking, the possibility of using hydraulic fracking to increase oil and gas production in Europe is therefore now with more emphasis on the table, and well, it s part of the search for energy security  It is indeed one of the components of diversification, it s not the only one, but, currently, given the issues that we have now seen, with respect to gas trade between Russia and Europe well it becomes more interesting to see what can be done with oil and gas  SS: Well you certainly know much more about fracking than I do  So how safe a technology is it? Because, we do see a lot of anti-fracking protests worldwide, like Bulgaria and France have rejected shale gas due to the harm it poses to the environment  What do you think of it? AFQ:We have seen so far practices that seem to be compatible with environmental protection  There have been experiences that have not been positive, that are under study, that have been addressed so far  So, it seems from what we know up to this point that production from shale resources is safe enough  So far, without any instance of major disaster for the environment or major issues socially, the industry seems to be progressing well, but of course everyone should be vigilant and every effort should be made that no harm to the environment and to other civic and societal concerns is made  SS: What about, like, minor disasters, not major, but minor disasters are they OK? Is it worth the big idea? AFQ:Well, no disaster is fine, right? None of that should be acceptable  The industry, and of course the governments should make sure that this production is done in the safest way possible, that no serious affectation is made  So, whatever type of accidents or concerns that have happened, both with production of shale, and production of unconventionals, or any other resource has to be addressed  SS: I ve been reading up on this a little bit, and there is in Britain, in Romania and even in US locals report seismic activity in their neighborhoods, and they say their tap water catches fire I mean, that s seems crazy, and there s this issue of water pollution with the chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing  Is this serious, is this big? AFQ:The evidence is not strong in that regard  We have seen claims about earthquakes associated with fracking, about water contamination  Interestingly, some of the concerns have been voiced also do involve the environment per se, but the level of traffic that is associated with the moving back and forth of trucks that are participating or are part of fracking process  But, the evidence, again, so far, is not strong to suggest that the environmental effects of fracking are adverse  SS: I want to get back to our part of the world, because this is what worries us the most  Now, the price Ukraine pays for Russian gas is $485 per 1,000 cubic meters  I just want your expert opinion, leaving the politics aside it wants to pay half the price, is that a fair request? AFQ:This is a commercial decision between supplier and consumer  What is, I think, clear to everyone, is that the supply bringing gas and oil to market is costly, and no one can reasonably expect that production should not be compensated  Likewise, it s not wise, from the producer side to think that taking measures that will affect consumers will be in anyone s interest certainly not for the long-term  So, a solution must be found that is fair to the producer and the consumer in this case  What we are seeing is a process for finding that solution, and I m confident that it will be found  SS: What would you advise, because Ukraine is unwilling to pay for gas, Russia is unwilling to budge what would your expect advice be in this dispute? They have kind of reached a deadlock right now AFQ:It might be a deadlock, but it s part, again, of the process, and in the past we have seen that these deadlocks are solved, this are positions that are not fixed through time, as conversations evolve, greaterlearning of what are their concerns and the possibilities will be available, and I m sure there will be a solution found  To insist, producers must be compensated, without a doubt, this is not a cheap business, and consumers must also count with the certainty that they will have the energy they need  The energy, as you may recall, in the international arena is more and more regarded as a human right and this is usually assumed or taken into account in the context of energy property; but, energy is crucial for development of every country, and the solution, to insist, will have to involve producers and consumers alike and this is part of the job, by the way, that of course we have to promote at the IEF  SS: Yeah, but it s quite unfortunate that this basic right is not free and cannot be free  Now, Ukraine wants to buy gas from Europe, as one of the solutions, and the deal is supposedly better than the one Russia is offering  Does Europe have enough supplies to sell extra to Kiev, and be a reliable long-term supplier, what do you think? AFQ:Well, right now, this doesn t seem to be evident, but I don t see why it should be a problem for any country to diversify its sources of supply, or of demand  That s, as I ve said in the beginning, a sensible energy policy  SS: Oh no, diversification is not a problem for anyone, I m just saying this option of buying gas from Europe instead of Russia is that a viable option as of today? That s what I m asking  AFQ:As of today well, no  Europe needs much more interconnections, and if I understand the question correctly, it involves mainly the countries of Central or Eastern Europe, and in all that part of Europe greater infrastructure is needed for distribution of gas, and investments will have to be made  SS: Now, there is this other idea that s been tossed around, specifically by George Soros, I think he is the one who came up with it and then everyone sort of started talking about it  It is some kind of coordinated action to bring down price of oil do you think it is a realistic possibility, will the OPEC countries agree to lose revenues in order to follow US foreign policy goals? AFQ:Coordinated actions to manipulate prices or to move prices in particular direction are hardly useful or beneficial  What we need is markets that work better, more freely, and that are more resilient  So, the actions must be to strengthen energy markets overall, so that we have also greater energy security  But either on the supply or the demand side to try to move prices in particular directions beyond the promotion of price stability which is necessary for long-term planning and investment I don t think it s in the interest of anyone, and certainly not useful for the promotion of economic growth  SS: Now Russia and America have had ideological differences over Ukraine, and the differences are quite acute at this moment but then you see oil giants like BP and Exxon Mobil (and they actually instead of [following the] White House s line have signed agreements with Russia s Rosneft) now, we re thinking over here, don t you find it a little silly, that they are making deals with a company whose CEO can t even visit them or even pay for their lunch, because, he is banned from everywhere I know it s an absurd situation, what do you make of it? AFQ:I think that this is part of a conduct of business, and we have to look at it from a pure framework there is what companies are doing and what states are also involved in, and we are also going to see a process of adjustment in this regard  But to qualify this as absurd that s your opinion, it s not mine  SS: What s not absurd is not the fact that companies are making deals despite of politics, the absurd [thing] is that the man who is in charge of the biggest company in Russia cannot even visit the companies who is he signing the deals with  That s what I meant, I just wanted to be precise  Alright, thank you so much for this wonderful insight in the world of energy  We were talking to Aldo Flores-Quiroga, chief of the International Energy Forum  We were talking about how Europe and Ukraine and also Russia can diversify their energy fields  It was great talking to you  That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co  I will see you next time  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/167256-eu-energy-independence-ukraine/
"26 May, 2014"," China to be the most important country in XXI century - Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment  There s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil  So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today  Follow@SophieCo_RT SS: Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us  We re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China  How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? JR:Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don t like saying it, since I m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together America is driving Russia more and more to Asia That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington  SS: So you re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? JR:Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly  As you know, they ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn t think through the consequences  Mr  Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that s not so unusual what s unusual is that America didn t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day-to-day basis, so now Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia  I m afraid America just didn t think it through, they ve bungled, they ve acted on a day-to-day basis, and they ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events  Mr  Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr  Obama  SS: You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine another embarrassment for the US foreign policies   Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? JR:That s an extremely good question  Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington  I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America  You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time  Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia  SS: But if you re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? JR:I didn t say it s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon  But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that s not that s good for Russia, that s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out  You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners  SS: George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy  Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? JR:America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to I mean, if we ve sold all of our oil reserves, it s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market  It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even  But, then the markets it s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn t have anything in reserve, so again, you have to ask him, I don t know, but that doesn t seem like a very viable solution to me  SS: But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe will the US be able to fill the gap? JR:No  America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe  You don t just sort of snap your fingers and do that  You don t just put in on a boat or plane, you ve got to have special ports on both sides, you ve got to have special ships, and you ve got to have natural gas in the right place  Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe that s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe  Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas - will they have a surplus in five years? I don t know  Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it  SS: I don t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine  Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? JR:Pay it back to the European Union? No, I doubt it very seriously  They re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas  I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it  I don t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back  SS: Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair? I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? JR:Sophie, you re asking extremely good question  I don t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play  I don t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game  I don t see what America expected to get out of it  Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine  It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would  SS: But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? JR:I don t see that it has hurt Russia  Maybe there s something I don t know, but I don t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point  SS: What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk  So where does that leave dollar? JR:Again, I don t particularly like saying this, because I m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar many people now must be saying guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don t like us, they ve going to put sanctions on us! So more and more people would say maybe I shouldn t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn t have my money in US dollars  At the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar  More and more people are doing the same thing, they re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar  This is just a continuing long-term move away from the US dollar  And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions  SS: So, if you re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? JR:The US has been the world s reserve currency, has had the world s medium of exchange and so far we ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars  We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money  If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say here they are! then that cripples America in many-many ways  The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view  Just recently, the space people said every country in the world has eventually collapsed and the way America is going, we might collapse too  This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things  If you read history, Sophie, it s true, it s correct  When people do not have the money that they used to have they re limited in many ways  You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don t have the money to pay for it anymore, you re in trouble  SS: You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? JR:It s a been a long-term adage in the investment world that you buy when there s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you re probably going to make a lot of money in the end unless the world comes to an end  I don t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy  I ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high that s what I m trying to do  SS: Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now JR:I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I ll tell you I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine  You don t buy something just because it s low because it can get lower and lower and lower  I d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it s going to continue to be in turmoil  If you ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10-15 years you know what I m talking about  Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now  SS: So what are you thinking how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? JR:I would suspect that it s going to America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well  As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said No, we re not going to do this anymore, we don t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia   Europeans don t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it s doing nothing  It doesn t hurt the Russians doesn t seem to  There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don t suspect that this is going to last much longer  SS: Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you re looking at non-energy companies  Is it right? JR: I have plenty of energy investment, so I m not investing in energy companies in Russia  I m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy  SS: Well, that s what I was going to ask you what do you invest in, in Russia? JR:I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares  I own shares of the Moscow s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I m looking for other areas to invest  I don t have any others yet, but I m looking  SS: Look, I ve got a sense from what you re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia  Is that s how it works, exactly? JR:I said, if there are more sanctions   Washington keeps saying they re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will  That s what they say they re going to do, they probably will do it  And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while  I have no idea of what s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak  But it often does  SS: Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well-known basic strategy but you re not afraid for the long-term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? JR:No, of course  My point about sanctions is that they don t seem to be hurting Russia, I don t see that there s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don t go along with them, or don t go along with them in a big way I don t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short-term  It s just that I don t see it  SS: With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? JR:Yes  I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you ve probably know  Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren t very viable, that they haven t hurt Russia in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they re doing more business with China  China is a pretty successful economy, so it s not hurting, and in some ways it s actually helping Russia, because it s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals  It s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars  SS: Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let s say, during your lifetime? JR:During my lifetime? SS: Yep  JR:Well, I hope I ll live a long time, Sophie, so yes  I hope I ll live a long, long time  SS: Well, we hope too  But tell me one more thing: do you think there s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? JR:Oh, I m sure we will  If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea  I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they re going to take advantage of it  So, no, it s happening  SS: You have said that you re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center you really think it has what it takes? JR:No, what I ve said was that I m astonished that they think that, that they re going to try I don t know if they can make that  Mr  Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center  I m astonished  I ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center  And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive  Whether it works or not in 10-15 years? I don t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center  SS: Talking about 10-15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age  Is that where the future is, in China? JR:In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not  Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world  SS: Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? JR:Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more  I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing  Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life  I ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years  I do think I see opportunities and therefore I m investing  SS: So when did you first come to Russia? JR:I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years  I knew I wouldn t work  But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I ve started investing in Russia  SS: So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? JR:No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events  I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok  I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together  I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn t as bad as it had been for 46 years  SS: I want to ask one more question about China  I m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn t suffered any crises yet  But, it might at some point, like all markets do so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? JR:Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it s going to affect some people  If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering  That s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now  It s just like if America has problems; it affects a lot of people  If Japan has problems, it affects some people  So there is no question that China will have problems I don t know what, or when, or why but every country has problems, somewhere along the line  What is a little bit unusual is that it s been a long time since China has had major problems  That is extremely unusual  That s one reason I m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I m waiting in case there s a problem coming out of China  If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I m smart enough to buy more china  SS: Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice  We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author  We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China  That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/161436-china-russia-investment-rogers/
"30 Mar, 2014", Gulf toil?,"US-Saudi relations have long been grounded in an oil-for-security exchange  But with U S  dependence on Middle Eastern oil diminishing and Saudi power rising, is there a growing gulf in the Gulf? Has the US spat with Russia affected this relationship, and could it lead to a change in the Syrian deadlock? Oksana is joined by Dr David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, to drill into these issues  WATCH: httPS: //www rt com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/http://www youtube com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart  President Obama spoke a lot about the good and bad ways of doing geopolitics this week - a rhetoric intended for European and possibly Russian ears that was all but brushed aside when he landed in Saudi Arabia  How is it that American values seem to depreciate every time the Saudis are involved? To discuss that, I'm now joined by David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies  Dr Weinberg, thank you very much for taking time to talk to us  David Weinberg:Thank you for having me  OB:Now, the organisation you work for was set up after 9/11 to promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism  Is there any country that is more antithetic to all those objectives than Saudi Arabia? DW:Sure, Syria, Iran, lots of countries  But certainly there's a big gap between the values of the US and the values of the Saudis  It's a relationship that's been strained by the conflicting values of the two sides  OB:But my question was whether Saudi Arabia really takes the cake for essentially lacking all the three elements that are mentioned in the purposes of the organisation that you work for  Again, there is not much in the way of pluralism, they don't value democracy at all, and when it comes to the ideology espoused by Saudi Arabia not only it condones terrorism, it actually supports it  DW:Yeah, I mean look, dictatorship is not a contest, but if it were, the Saudis would be doing great  My organisation has actually been quite active on this issue  For instance, this week we put out a report highlighting the hate that is continually, still being taught in Saudi Arabia's public schools through their textbook system  So, we certainly are no friends of the Saudis on this issue, and we certainly hope that the President had some very serious conversations about human rights behind closed doors, while he was in Saudi Arabia  OB:Well this is a very mild way of putting it  But Saudi Arabia is not officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism  And yet it is well known that it is the largest source of financing when it comes to militant jihadi groups such as the Taliban or Al Qaeda  And I hardly need to mention that it is Americans who suffered a great deal from the terror plots hatched, and sometimes executed with the help of Saudi money  Fifteen out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals  And when you think about it, had they been Russians, I think we could have had an outbreak of World War III by now  But with the Saudis, again, it's always let's be patient with them   And it may be a personal question, but for a country like Russia, which often finds itself on the receiving end of US condemnation without hurting a single American, it's very difficult to understand why would Americans let the Saudis off the hook so easily, given how many Americans were hurt in 9/11? DW:Absolutely  Well, you know, I think it's reflected, first of all, in public opinion numbers  Saudi Arabia has absolutely dreadful numbers when you as the American public what they think of the other country  But when you say Saudi money going to sponsor terrorism, I'm curious whether you mean state money going to sponsor terrorism, or whether you mean private money going to sponsor terrorism? Which do you mean? OB:Well Dr Weinberg, I mean both  Because obviously, there are some private sponsors of terror groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Lebanon  They used to sponsor insurgency in Chechnya as well  But official government structures in Saudi Arabia are not the most transparent, so you can never be sure that official money is not being used for the same purpose  DW:But is there evidence of official money? I don't think so  OB:Well, I think Prince Bandar, for one, is quite involved in sponsoring various rebel groups in Syria  And I guess we can argue about the definition of terrorism and freedom fighting, but I think it is pretty clear that Saudi Arabia is supporting groups that use terror as a tactic in Syria  So, that would be, sort of, evidence, wouldn't it? DW:Sure, I mean I think that some of Saudi Arabia's identified clients in Syria are extremely unappealing  For instance, the extremist group most convincingly tied to Saudi governmental assistance is called Jaysh al-Islam, or the Army of Islam, which is led by a man called Zahran Alloush, whose father is a preacher in Saudi Arabia, and who advocates ethnic cleansing of Shiites and opposes democracy  This is an organisation that by and large is repulsive and antithetical to western values, and it's an organisation that the US has been, to my understanding, pushing the Saudis behind the scenes to reduce their support for  OB:You just mentioned how little support there is for the Saudis and their tactics among the American public  And yet American politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, seem to be sort of welcoming, or at least tight-lipped, when it comes to criticism of the Saudi officials  Why do you think that is? DW:Well, I think we need to differentiate between the executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue  Because, I think the legislative branch has been quite comfortable raising concerns about Saudi policies that conflict with universal human rights and democratic values  So for instance, members of Congress for both parties, in the last week and a half, have issued letters to the President, calling on him to make human rights part of the discussion, and to make religious freedom part of the discussion when he went to Saudi Arabia  So I do think that American politicians of both stripes, be it Democratic or Republican, are not reluctant to speak out about this issue  But I do think that when either party is in power at the White House, they certainly have incentives to try elicit regional cooperation from the Saudis, and unfortunately sometimes that means human rights reform issues get kicked a little bit lower on the priority list  Just as that sometimes is the case in US relations with Russia  American officials would actually like to be raising these issues even more often than they do with Russia, but because of Russia's important role as a geopolitical power, don't even raise it as much as they actually would, as surprising as that may be for some of your viewers to hear  OB:But Dr Weinberg, I wonder how much more often those issues could be raised? Because I think human rights in Russia is one of the most popular issues for American politicians, whether of the executive or legislative branch  But going back to Saudi Arabia, President Obama has just visited Riyadh  What do you think he was hoping to achieve there? DW:Well I think the messaging coming out of the White House really focused on trying to dispel the image that there's a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United States  So even as the President's plane was pulling into Saudi Arabia, his deputy national security advisor was giving a briefing to the press corps, and he was trying to emphasise that things have gotten better in the US-Saudi relationship since the fall, when the Saudis were upset  So, not denying that the Saudis have been upset with the US, but trying to argue that that dispute over Iran, over Syria, over other issues, has been resolved or at least significantly reduced  As to whether that narrative is going to be seen as persuasive, either by the media or the general public, we still have yet to see  OB:Now the biggest strain, as many analysts have identified, in this bilateral relationship is Americas reluctance to fully back the Saudis in their existential fight against the Shia forces of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, possibly Iraq  And this fight that the Saudis are in is not driven by money, it is not driven by political calculations  It is driven by genuine values, however archaic and bigoted they may be  And I wonder, given the existential nature of this fight, whether Americans can really reason with the Saudis at this point, or is it increasingly a case of the tail wagging the dog here DW:Well, I certainly would agree with you with regard to your argument that this is an area where the US really has some difficulties satisfying the Saudis fully  You know, the Saudi public sees what's going on in Syria as the greatest humanitarian calamity of our age  And that's not my words, that's the Saudi Foreign Minister's words  And so what they see are Shiites, whom they already have dehumanised in their education and religious system as heretics, slaughtering Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, slaughtering Sunni civilians as well as rebels  And so, in that regard, the Saudis want the US to decapitate the regime in Syria, at the very least by toppling it  And so the Saudis are not going to be satisfied when they see the US pursuing an approach that actually, in some regards on the battlefield, is quite similar to Russia's strategy, which is to have this conflict turn into a stalemate  The Russians want to enable Assad to not be toppled, to outlast the conflict  And the US wants to ensure, like Russia purportedly, a political solution to this conflict, by ensuring that the rebels are not fully marginalised on the battlefield  But when it comes to actually toppling the Assad regime militarily, the US administration has held back to some extent until now  And we'll just have to see whether the Saudis can convince them to take a harder line on this  It certainly could happen, especially if there's no progress at Geneva  OB:Since you mentioned Russia's intentions in Syria, I think Russia would much have preferred not having this conflict to begin with  I think this conflict was initiated and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US to begin with  So it is those two countries that actually opted for changing the status quo  But rather than going in depth into Syria, I would like to ask you very quickly this relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was founded on a quite explicit agreement that Washington would defend the Gulf state in exchange for oil contracts  And the US no longer needs that much Saudi oil, and the nature of security threats has also changed  So I wonder if it's possible that, sooner or later, the US and Saudi Arabia will have to part ways? DW:Well, first of all, I'd like to address something that you said right before your question, which is how this conflict started  As Americans see it, the way this conflict started was a Russian supported dictator, Bashar al-Assad, slaughtered his people when they went out on the street and peaceably demonstrated  As well as arresting and torturing teenagers  So that is how we see how this conflict started  As to whether the US and the Saudis - OB:Well, you see this conflict this way because you are told that this conflict started this way  As somebody who was on the ground in Syria, all those three years ago, I can tell you that there were snipers, there were provocation, there were Saudi agents there on the scene  So obviously the tactics of Bashar al-Assad are not to be defended, and his indiscriminate use of force  But I wonder if the US would react in any different way if the constitutional law and order were threatened? For once, if I can remind you of the search operation for the Boston bombers, if you remember a couple of years ago  The whole city of Boston was blocked to find two men, police was used and he was shot dead  So, I think Americans use force quite extensively when their own security is compromised, but they for some reason deny that right to other countries  But I would still like you to answer that question about whether you see any chance for the US and Saudi Arabia parting ways geopolitically, given how different their value systems really are? DW:Well, having lived in Boston, having actually lived on the same block as the Boston bomber, having been a graduate student at MIT in the past where a police officer was slaughtered by the bombers no doubt Americans take terrorism seriously  As to whether the Saudis and the US are going to part ways, the triumphalism of the shale energy boom to some extent is overwrought  Because the US, just as Russia, just as other countries are in the global economy, are dependant on stability in the global price of oil  And in that regard, until industrialised countries such as the US, such as Russia, such as the countries of east and south Asia, have fuel choice about the fuel they put in their automobiles, we're going to be continually dependant on the security in the Gulf  OB:I see  Dr Weinberg, we have to take a short break now, but when we come back - the United States has rediscovered its good old enemy in Russia  What does this mean for the future of US-Saudi relations? That's coming up in a few moments on Worlds Apart  OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the love-hate relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia with David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies  DW:That's a great way of putting it  OB:Dr Weinberg, you just heard, I turned it in terms of love and hate, and I'm not sure about the love, but to see the examples of hatred, all you need to do is to open the Saudi school textbooks, which you alluded to earlier, that for decades have been spewing vitriol at everything Western  And as you mentioned, you wrote a very interesting report recently on how lenient the US has been recently with Saudi Arabia on this issue  But I wonder, what is the real reason for Saudi procrastination in removing all those vitriolic passages from their textbooks? DW:Well, first of all, I'd like to say that I don't think that the US has been uniquely lax when it comes to raising Saudi textbooks  In fact, I think it's done more than any other government in its exchanges with the Saudi authorities on this issue  For instance, I saw no indication that this was part of the conversation when Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin met last year in Moscow  So I think there are things that other countries could do  That having been said, the US has more leverage that it could potentially use with Saudi Arabia on this issue  And in that regard, I really do with the US would do more  OB:Well Dr Weinberg, the reason why President Putin may not raise this issue, or other issues, with foreign visitors is because Russia doesn't make the promotion of democracy the pillar of its foreign policy  It's the US that does  And if I'm not mistaken, the State Department first noted a problem with the Saudi textbooks all the way back in 2003  And ever since then, the Saudis have assumed this very typical approach for them of not saying no outright, but not delivering either  And my question to you is whether they see any practical gain in essentially indoctrinating their youth in this mindset, whether they do it on purpose as a part of state ideology? DW:Well, I think Saudi Arabia, like any country, does have some internal debates, even as an absolute monarchy  But that having been said, I do think that the Saudi authorities bear responsibility for what's in these books, especially because these books are printed on an annual basis by their Ministry of Education  So they are to blame for what's published in their texts  The Saudi monarch, and the Saudi royal family, and the government say that these books have been reformed, that they're being improved  But when they say that, they only take the lowest hanging fruit  They take some of the hatred out of elementary school books  They say that they spent money on teacher training, to moderate teachers  They say that they're increasing the number of women in universities  But the reason that they don't take this on more seriously, I think, is because they see more benefit in not upsetting their conservative, reactionary preachers, than they see in telling their children a more tolerant view of the world and keeping their children from being indoctrinated  So I do think that it really will take diplomatic consequences in Saudi Arabia's foreign relations with the international community for this to change  OB:Now, this violent extremism that children are being taught in Saudi public schools is bad when it is targeted at you, but when it targets some of your rivals, it may come in handy  And here I would like to shift gears a little bit and discuss the Saudi-US relations vis-a-vis Russia, because there are quite a few historic examples when this partnership was very successful in undermining Moscow  I wonder whether these recent tensions that we saw between Russia and the West, and the US in particular, could lead President Obama to re-evaluate or rethink his relationship with Saudi Arabia  DW:Actually, I think US-Russian relations in the last month have added an extra strain to to the US-Saudi relationship  Because the Saudis wish that the US had been firmer with Russia over the Crimea  Just as they saw the US choosing to pursue a negotiated deal with Russia over Syria's chemical weapons in the fall, this was an area where US, Russia I'd like to say at least averting away from more direct conflict actually came at some cost to the US in its relationship with the Saudis  Similarly, the US helped turned the tide of the battle in Afghanistan in the '80s, against the Soviet Union, by introducing a large number of MANPADS man-portable air defence systems that the Mujahiddeen used against the Soviet air force  The US hasn't gotten much credit from the Russians for something that they've done, which is showing some restraint when it comes to MANPADS in Syria today  The Saudis have been itching to introduce those in massive numbers, unsupervised, without any sort of permissive action links, without any sort of way for the US, for instance, to disable them if they fall in the hands of Al Qaeda  But the US has actually held relatively firm on that to date, and that's an area in which the US hasn't gotten much credit  OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, I think this is a very novel interpretation of both recent events in history  Because if it wasn't for the US and Saudi Arabia, those weapons wouldn't be in Syria in the first place  So I don't see how we can credit the US for not restraining Saudi Arabia well enough  Going back to Ukraine, there have been reports that Washington has already reached out to Saudi Arabia to provide some of the $15 billion promised to Ukraine  And while Saudi Arabia doesn't have any intrinsic interest in Ukraine, what it is interested in is seeing Washington toughen up on Syria  And I wonder if we could see any sort of Ukraine-for-Syria swap here essentially Saudi Arabia giving the money for Ukraine, but Washington in return doing what Riyadh wants it to do in Syria? DW:You know, actually the most persuasive tit-for-tat of this sort that I've seen has been a recent story in the Washington Post, suggesting that the US is finally considering doubling its training of vetted Syrian rebels, to be funded by the Qatari treasury  So if there's going to be a tit-for-tat, in this regard, that's actually where I've seen some suggestions that it might happen  OB:Now, Russia is a natural rival for the US in Ukraine, and for Saudi Arabia in Syria so much so that George Soros has already suggested that the two team up in driving the oil prices down  And of course, this move proved to be very effective back in the '80s, when these two countries colluded in driving the oil prices down, and that proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union  Do you think that could work this time around? DW:No, I don't think there's persuasive US-Saudi collusion on the energy price that actually influences Saudi energy policy  The Saudis make their oil production decisions based on internal budgetary issues, and they do this also by looking at the domestic situation in Saudi Arabia and making outlays to keep their public quiet  So that, I think, is actually going to be the biggest driver of Saudi oil policy  But, you know, they can be hypocritical about this too, just as the US can be hypocritical about where and when it supports democracy, just as Russia can be hypocritical about where and when it supports sovereignty  OB:I wonder if we could consider one more way of how the Saudis and Americans could exact their vengeance, or their revenge on Russia, and that would be by supporting terror groups  They used to do that in Chechnya, as I mentioned before, and they could probably do the same in Crimea, which has a somewhat sizeable population, couldn't they? DW:Well actually, the Muslim population in Crimea is significantly smaller before Stalin ethnically cleansed the place  So actually, I think that leverage is much smaller now  OB:But, just fore the benefit of our viewers, as far as I know, I may be mistaken but back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Crimea was a very popular destination for wounded Chechen rebels  First, because of the geographic proximity to Chechnya, and also because of the somewhat lax security policy of the Ukrainian authorities  I think it is estimated that at the moment, there are around 5,000 followers of the Wahhabi branch of Islam in the Crimea, and I guess you wouldn't need even that many to stir trouble? DW:Well, you know, first of all it is important to distinguish between people's religious views, be they intolerant or not, and whether they're actually engaged in acts of violence  But certainly I do think that when an intolerant brand of religion is promoted in places abroad, including in elements of the Soviet Union, there are consequences for that down the road, absolutely  OB:Well one of the natural consequences for Moscow would be to deepen its ties with Tehran, especially given the very politically-correct reaction of the Rouhani government to Crimea's joining Russia  But I wonder if that will deepen the trenches even more in this geopolitical rivalry? DW:It's absolutely possible, but I do think it conflicts with what the Rouhani government's strategy is in Iran, which is a little bit different than what the Supreme Leader's strategy is in Iran  The Supreme Leader's strategy is direct confrontation with the US  The Rouhani government's strategy is to maintain many of the Islamic republic's policies, but to try and achieve some sort of rapprochement with the international community  They may not be ready to pay the cost of what that entails, and they've given no indication that they're ready to stop the IRGC's terrorist activities in places like the Levant and the Gulf  And that's actually what motivates the Saudis to push hard when it comes to Iran issues, and something that the US, personally I think, could be doing a little more on  Certainly Russia could do more on it as well OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, unfortunately we have to leave it there, I appreciate your being on the show  DW:Thank you, Oksana  OB:And to our viewers - keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and I hope to see you again - same place, same time here on Worlds Apart  RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/usa-saudi-russia-relations-165/
"28 Mar, 2014", Intellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf-based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones  Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist  He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter  Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist  He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter  The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute  There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices  There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government  It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West  There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently  That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly-educated
 work force  They offered a deal  A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there  The elected government rejected such farce  The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra-nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown  Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity  People voted, democratically  Russia
 simply accepted the outcome  The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted  It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies  In the meantime, the fascist pro-Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer  There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet-style Egypt is a close Western ally  Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub-Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest-fires: proof of a
 gangster-run economy  Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations  Again no condemnation  Not even an
 alarm  Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC)  There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed  The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre-fabricated platform  The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it  In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support  ""Take the invasion of Iraq - nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal  In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well-known  The United States
 is self-immunized from any prosecution  When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty - meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions  The US
 is self-immunized from any trial on those issues  And the Court
 has accepted that  So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it "" ""In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution  There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful  I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that  The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there  In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self-immunization is at many levels  One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes  The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation  Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice  David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing  Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language  Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers  Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty  Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all  Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right-wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right-wing agenda through their
 publications  The state-owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, David told me about this issue  The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus  Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets  The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia  In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa  The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says  In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty  But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars - that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces - so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society  Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, Black
 told me  Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta  Legendary radio host Dr  Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world  It is called USA declares war on
 democracy   In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy  This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so-called Machiavelli of non-violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings  But Sharp's so-called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions  They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning  George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power-hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent-a-mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, Barrett wrote  But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance  While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices  Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co-editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context  What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far-right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup  There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, Kolesnik said  What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide  Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far-right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda   So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims  If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement  And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, Kolesnik said  He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units  As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions  Please, no Nazi salutes and anti-Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there  And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, he asserts  Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti-fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro-Russian protesters, the Western media never show it  But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro-democracy protesters   Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country  Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info-war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do  Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, he
 says  I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport  I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals  I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense  Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well-edited and designed propaganda sheets  I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half-naked President Putin on a heavily-armed
 tank  It reads The New World Order   But it is not yet here, this New World Order  It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity  And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel
 religions  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-intellectuals-standing-ground-833/
"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long-awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support  Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions  Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising  Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information  You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ]  The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia  This has been the color revolutions that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way  It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments  It s not something that comes as a surprise to me  SS: You ve mentioned Georgia and Orange Revolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it  What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time  SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing  USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now  You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan  Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s  SS: You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros  When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it  What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government  The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another protÃ©gÃ© of that whole Shachtmanite issues  You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well-known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich  Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine  He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations  SS: But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government  That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years  SS: The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest  I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent  SR:I absolutely agree  The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing  Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown  SS: The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned or gotten out of control it s a fine line  There are individuals who are very well-trained  These NGOs operate on every level  They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side  It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations  Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings  You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain  These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly  SS: What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev  Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier - because the patrols are less likely - it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places  Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners  And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists  SS: If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia-Herzegovina - is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the European Union has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures  People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction  We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other  And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine - the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 - that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it  Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades  SS: Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic  Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev  Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West  That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe  That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back -three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well  So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time  SS: With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea  So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti-Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich  So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west  At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it  But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor - you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already  It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing  SS: If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity  Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp ofâ¦ and there s a lot of money that comes with that  There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders - it comes with the good price tag  SS: So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your moneyâ¦NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative  SS: If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine  SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either  Let s say that NATO does want to come in - they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters - so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economiesâ¦because NATO won t come in as a state, run onlyâ¦you know, European Union will have to come alongside it  So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians  It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance  SS: The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately  Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill  There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding  Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get  Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU  So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway  The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton-Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world  They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy  I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it  I think the Western economy is poison  SS: You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May  Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that  That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for thatâ¦ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic  That s the problem that I have with this  You talk about hegemony - the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance  I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance  SS: What about these sanctions that the U S  and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy  What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally - I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success  They would slow down the amount of success that they are having  The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts  They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus  That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the European Union, and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit  SS: Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran  At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russiaâ¦you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe  So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets  Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time  SS: But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question  Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all  Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry  I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors  I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states  SS: Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise  Everything else is sort of hanging on Germanyâ¦ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise  SS: â¦It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating  Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine  I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can  I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this  He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the European Union  I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money  I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine  SS: If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money   RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"14 Mar, 2014",Britain s being relegated to lowest tier in EU - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse  Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near-death state of Ukrainian finances but doesn t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament  Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it s great to have you with us today  I m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously the EU s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine  Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them how and why? Bill Cash:I m very much in favor of political cooperation, I m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious  It would have been far better if it had been a lower-key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was misconceived and he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I ll just quote from it: This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits  In retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes  It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement  Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn t been so ambitious  I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely naÃ¯ve  I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation  SS: But what about now, Mr  Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it s on the brink of bankruptcy can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is No , and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this because when they say 35 billion you can usually add quite a lot more  The fact is that proportionately, we re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt  SS: But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won t end up in the new elite s pockets? BC:Well, that s a very important question  It could apply to almost any country of the EU  The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years so the probability of the money getting astray is very-very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption  That is well known  Quite frankly, we don t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don t think the money is there to pay for it  SS: Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms  What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don t know  What I do know is that there are very big questions here - I mean, I m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well-negotiated answer to these problems  I m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel  But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis  I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years  SS: Keeping in mind everything you ve said right now, Mr  Cash and talking about being realistic what do you think about Ukraine s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries  I m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states  I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate  I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said we should be associated, but not absorbed , and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion - I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional  It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected  There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law  If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation  I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U S  and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating  SS: Yeah, but it doesn t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break  I m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U S  diplomats which openly dismiss the EU s efforts in Ukraine should the EU swallow its pride and follow America s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the European Union must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy  I m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many-many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU  It is just simply a complete mess, and I don t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy  I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries  I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy  SS: The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I ve seen the regulations in question  In fact, I m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth  But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you , and given the fact that everyone is saying there won t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very-very bad situation  When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better  SS: Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office  Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don t regard the EU as having its own money as such it s a way of interpreting the situation  When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it  As far as I m concerned, it s our money and I m very glad we re getting it back again  I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself  SS: Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem  As one EU official put it, the scale of it is breathtaking   Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking  I may say that I wouldn t exonerate any country, I don t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world  It s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy  It s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts  All I can say is that it has to be dealt with  The court of Auditors of the EU do their best  We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly every year  I ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn t been signed off, as far as I m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife  I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether  SS: Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well  Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU  We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don t think that the consequences and this is a very large subject - of majority voting and co-decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need  I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically  I don t think that s healthy, as I ve said in Germany itself, I don t think it s healthy for Germany and I don t think it s healthy for Europe as a whole  SS: Now you ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project  Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two-tier Europe which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I ve said over this, over the last 20 years there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent  But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want  That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time  SS: Talking about great democracy and protecting it you ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration  What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I ve just said  By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy  SS: But, here s another thing  You ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream what s changed? BC:Well, I think that s the recognition that it didn t work  It has taken a very-very long time  People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin-masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments  It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right not with any great self-satisfaction, because as far as I m concerned, it s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s  SS: Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even  Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration  You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land-mass  Unlike France it is a relatively small land-mass  And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded  I am actually not in principle against immigration I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen  But, by the same token, there have to be limits  An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages  SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation  Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain s membership of the EU  That s it for this edition of the Sophie&Co, we ll see you next time  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/british-mp-eu-problems-738/
"13 Mar, 2014", Soros tells Europe: Imposing sanctions on Russia not the best way forward,"Billionaire financier George Soros says the Ukrainian turmoil is a wake-up call for Europe, which should remember its aim and focus on integration  The EU must aid Ukraine financially or technically, rather than cut ties with Russia  ""It's very important to respond and respond the right way
 which is not necessarily to impose sanctions on Russia, but to
 actually help Ukraine financially and also technical assistance,
 something like a European Marshall Plan for Ukraine, that would
 be the right response,"" Soros said in an interview to
 Bloomberg  Under the post-war Marshall Plan the US provided help to Western
 Europe worth billions of dollars in the form of food, fuel,
 machinery and investment  Europe may face 25 years of stagnation if government officials
 don t make an effort to strengthen and further integrate the
 currency union, Soros warned  Such a prolonged economic slowdown
 may prove unsustainable for Europe, he added  The financial crisis in Europe which began in 2010 has almost
 ended  However the region is still facing a political crisis,
 which has split the area into country creditors and country
 debtors, Soros said  You have to go further with the integration  You have to
 solve the banking problem, because Europe is lagging behind the
 rest of the world in sorting out its banks  At the same time banks are oriented to passing the stress tests,
 instead of stimulating the economy by capital injections in
 business, Soros believes  According to Soros, the EU gave a poor option to Ukraine which
 gave the advantage to Russia  ""Europe, true to form, demanded a lot and offered
 little,""Soros said  ""It was not difficult for Putin to
 come up with a better offer "" The crisis in Ukraine emerged last year when former President
 Victor Yanukovich decided not to sign an association agreement

"27 Feb, 2014", West plays with fire to drive the Russian naval base out of Crimea ,"Crimea s ethnic composition and Western policy towards Ukraine could create a Kosovo-like scenario where the majority of Russian speaking residents would claim independence which could lead to violence on the ground, Oxford historian Mark Almond told RT  RT:If the EU and the US are concerned about
 doing what people on the Maidan want, why are they ignoring what
 people in Crimea want? Mark Almond:Well one would have thought so if
 you re going to listen to the crowd on the street on the square
 and there are many squares where there re crowds including
 Simferopol and Sevastopol  The basic problem of course is what
 the Americans, particularly the lead military power in NATO want,
 is to eventually ease the Russian navy out of its base, out of
 its lease in Sevastopol in the Crimea  And so of course the fact
 that the great majority of people in Crimea not only 60 per cent
 that are actually Russian but many of the rest who speak Russian
 as their everyday language is something that the EU and NATO
 countries want to ignore  Of course if you have any kind of push
 to create a crisis, I m afraid our democratic basis as in Kosovo
 where the great majority, where the great majority of Albanians
 wanted to be independent from Serbia, you would create a Kosovo
 crisis in Crimea  But of course strangely enough Washington and
 Brussels suddenly aren t terribly interested in this  I myself
 think that creating a crisis is not a good idea, but nonetheless
 they seem to be bent on pushing to increase tension between
 people on the Peninsula  And of course there is a risk of
 violence against either ethnic Russians, civilians that are there
 or against the sailors and soldiers on the base  RT:The Crimean Tatars have long been
 calling for the establishment of their own autonomy, why are they
 now siding with the pro-EU crowds in Kiev? MA:I think this is a very incoherent position 
 The Tatars historically are seen as the traditional native
 inhabitants of the Crimea  Catherine the Great s Russia took over
 250 years ago and then of course Khrushchev, the communist
 dictator gave Crimea to Ukraine only 60 years ago  The Tatars
 feel that they have been neglected and eventually many of them
 who have been forced out of their territory have come back  But I
 think it is a great mistake to think that they are the supporters
 of the Ukrainian nationalism  My experience in the Crimea is that
 most Tatars speak Russian as their everyday language and of
 course they do learn Tatar as well  And they don t have any great
 sympathy for Ukrainian nationalism and now of course the
 transitional government in Kiev has abolished the language
 rights, not only Russian but of Tatars and Hungarians in the
 West  So again we have this paradox  The EU is a great believer
 of minority rights, except when these minorities aren t fully
 paid up supporters of its crowd on the streets of central Kiev 
 And I think again many Tatars in fact walked to the
 demonstration, I don t think that we should overate the fact that
 a group of people, many of them have been beneficiaries of George
 Soros s language schools and scholarships  We should not be
 overrating how many of the many thousands of Tatars who live in
 Crimea necessarily want trouble  I think this is an exaggeration  RT:At the start of the rally in Crimea, we
 saw the Tatars vastly outnumbering the ethnic Russian crowd  Does
 that reflect the real numbers among these ethnic groups
 there? MA:No, of course what we see, actually what we
 saw on Maidan Square in Kiev, strangely enough the spontaneous
 demonstrations of pro-westerners is much better organized, funded
 when you bring in Brussels and lorry loads of people  But of
 course once this crowd assembled, I m afraid it drew out the
 majority of the local population who are Russians, and this is
 very dangerous  It seems to me that the Americans and the people
 in the Soros foundation who support these local nationalist
 groups are playing with fire  Because if you begin to send out a
 relatively small crowd of people to ban things that frighten the
 majority of people in the first place  It is very dangerous just
 like it would be if suddenly a lot of Russians appeared in Lvov,
 in Western Ukraine and started saying Shouldn t we all be part
 of Russia   It would be very provocative and very dangerous  But
 it seems to me that the West is not totally concerned about this
 danger and that I think could lead to another Crimean War
 exploding in our faces 160 years after the last one RT:How did these ethnic groups end up in
 Crimea anyway? MA:As I ve said about 250 years ago, Crimea was
 ruled by the Muslim Tatar Khans who were subjects of the Ottoman
 Empire  Catherine the Great of Russia conquered what we now call
 the Ukraine and the Crimea  Then with the WWI, the Russian
 Revolution tool place and the anti-communists were driven out of
 Crimea and most of Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union  When
 Hitler came in 1941, he eventually captured Sevastopol in Crimea 
 But when the Nazis were forced to withdraw, Stalin took the view
 that the ethnic Tatars were being anti-Russian, anti-Soviet have
 collaborated with the Nazis  I think this is a travesty of the
 behavior of most those Tatars, although ironically now we have
 Germans newspapers saying, how wonderful the Tatars are to be
 collaborating with the united Europe  Leave that aside, huge
 numbers of Tatars were deported to Central Asia  Eventually in
 the Gorbachev period 30 years ago they were allowed to return, to
 come back to the Crimea  Sadly in the meantime all sorts of other
 people, who lived there themselves of course, could be Russians
 for generations, or people who in the Soviet period have moved
 in, are living where they re used to live  So the tragedy for many of the Tatars is that they have left
 where they have grown up in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, come back
 to the Crimea and find nowhere to live, live in poverty and I m
 afraid to say some of whom may be agitatedbecause of the living
 rate poverty  People also in the Western Ukraine do when somebody
 comes and says, you could have a career, here is a little bit of
 money to set up an activist NGO group and so on - who would not
 take it if you are destitute  And that I think is the danger  We
 have in fact an under employed population who can be agitated  RT:So what do you think will happen next in
 Crimea? MA:Well Crimea which is such a beautiful place
 should be the center of interaction between the Russian cultures,
 Chekov lived there, of Tatar culture and the playground on the
 seashore  The danger is if you allow people to be obsessed that
 one nation has to dominate, and in this case a very small number
 of Ukrainians who live in Crimea are being used by the great
 majority of the Ukrainians who live outside the Peninsula and by
 the West because it wants to get rid of the Russian naval base,
 to be a battering ram  And I think this is very dangerous 
 Ideally Crimea would be a sunny playground for everybody to
 enjoy  Sadly, I think people from a long way away are prepared to
 play with fire to drive the naval base out  But if we remember
 what happened in 1850s, we can discover that the Crimean conflict
 can turn out to drag in other people  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-crimea-west-policy-942/
"15 Nov, 2013",Gays caused Chelyabinsk meteorite? Russian LGBT community accuses TV show of hate speech,"A Russian TV host has made quite a peculiar remark linking the Chelyabinsk meteorite and the country s gay movement  Russia s LGBT community reacted angrily and asked prosecutors to check the host s show for hate speech  In a reference to the Old Testament story of the cities of Sodom
 and Gomorrah, famous journalist Arkady Mamontov said on his
 program that the fall of the Chelyabinsk meteorite on February 15
 in Russia was related to the country s growing gay activity 
 Mamontov s program Special Correspondent airs on state channel
 Rossiya 1 The host called the meteorite a warning ""to all of us that we
 should keep the family tradition, traditional love, or else
 something else - not only the Chelyabinsk meteorite - will hit
 us ""The Russian LGBT Network rights group filed a complaint with the
 prosecutor s office on Thursday  The group accused the show of
 hate speech, according to group chairman Igor Kochetkov  He said
 that Mamontov also claimed that gays and lesbians want to
 ""destroy [traditional] Russia  A Special Correspondent episode aired on Tuesday included the new
 documentary film Litsedei (Hypocrites), which tells of the
 alleged threat from Western countries that are trying to carry
 out a gay revolution in Russia by organizing a protest movement
 based on claims that homosexuals are oppressed The film also alleges that conferences of the LGBT community in
 Russia are sponsored from abroad - in particular by the fund of
 American business magnate George Soros In a statement on the website of the Association of Russian
 Lawyers for Human Rights, lawyer and human rights activist Maria
 Bast who was featured in the documentary accused the makers
 of slander and misrepresentation  She went on to say that the
 film reflected intolerance and fascism Russia s leading LGBT activist and lawyer, Nikolay Alekseev, has
 submitted a request to Moscow authorities to gain permission to
 stage a protest against Mamontov s show  He also said on his
 Facebook page that he gave a two-hour interview to the filmmakers

"26 Aug, 2013",The world according to the global power brokers,"When the World Economic Forum released its 2013 Global Risks Report earlier this year, it included an interesting array of proposals which should raise eyebrows and be taken very seriously  Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant  Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op-ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda RepÃºblica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda RepÃºblica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant  Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op-ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda RepÃºblica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda RepÃºblica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi The World Economic Forum (WEF) used risk management exercises to
 address many of the challenges that we all know about growing
 social and political violence, the West s on-going financial
 collapse, food and water shortages, and the Elite s all-time
 favorite global terrorism   However, they also worked out proposals for government and some rather uncanny X Factors which, coming as they
 do from one of the global powers favorite think-tanks, we would
 do well to read between the lines  As German playwright Johann W  Goethe once remarked, coming
 events cast their shadows forwards   This is particularly
 true when those shadows are cast by global power brokers in a
 position to drive and control those coming events, according to
 their hearts desire, and here we are talking about the World
 Economic Forum (WEF), founded in 1971  Chaired by Klaus Schwab,
 who sits on David Rockefeller s Trilateral Commission, means he
 has direct access to the families of Rockefeller, Bush, Soros,
 Kissinger, Brzezinski, Rothschild, Lazard, Harriman, Montbatten,
 Warburg, Schiff, BorbÃ³n, and Orange  Indeed, it is from behind these curtains that the global elite
 are planning to impose a world government on all mankind; by
 designing, planning, and executing the macro-changes that they
 need to impose upon all countries each according to need and in
 their due time - as the process of privatizing global power rams
 forwards on a global scale  Two interesting issues are being highlighted by the elite through
 the WEF: the re-engineering of national governments, and the
 introduction of so-called X Factors into the collective
 psyche  Subtitled Lessons Learned from around the World; Global
 Agenda Council on the Future of Government , this WEF piece
 written in 2011 echoes the Council on Foreign Relations academic,
 Richard Gardner s seminal essay written almost forty years ago on
 the hard road to the new world order , where he
 recommended sovereign Nation-states should be eroded piece by
 piece   This Report urges governments to align to the future by
 adapting and continuously evolving to create value , adding
 that governments need to stay relevant by being responsive to
 rapidly changing conditions and citizens expectations, and build
 capacity to operate effectively in complex, interdependent
 networks of organizations and systems across the public, private
 and non-profit sectors to co-produce public value  It then goes on to recommend what is needed today is Flatter,
 Agile, Streamlined and Tech-enabled (FAST) government  Translating this think-tankese mumbo-jumbo into English, we get: Flatter = less authority; less sovereignty; Agile = more malleable; controllable; Streamlined = less meaningful; less powerful  Tech-enabled = subservient to those who own/operate/control
 technological R&D  Need we remind ourselves that the true mission of sovereign
 nation-states is not to adapt and continuously evolve which, again, is think-tankese for aligning to the coming
 world government, or else ? The true and inalienable functions of sovereign nation-states and
 their governments are to: Promote the Common Good of the vast majority of the people over
 and above the interests and greed of powerful local and/or
 foreign minorities, that are embedded in local, public and
 private power structures, and Defend the country s national interest in today s dangerous, even
 deadly, world made so precisely because of small and
 illegitimately powerful minorities that have everywhere usurped
 far too much power  President Putin of Russia understands this only too well; so does
 president Xi Jinping of China    Most other countries,
 however, either never learned this fundamental lesson or seem to
 have forgotten it  The global elites suggest a number of measures to align civil
 service systems to the requirements of their proposed FAST
 Governments based on such factors as carefully planned workforce
 reductions coupled with the significant organizational,
 technological and workforce advances inherent in FAST governments
 to build slim and streamlined organizations that can thrive in
 the new world order    Adaptive governments that share labor,
 services and resources through networked approaches and Gov 2 0
 strategies can remain slim while delivering on their mission in
 effective and innovative ways  Yes, I know: this sounds far more like a Corporate Annual Report
 than a geopolitical piece for creative statesmanship  The authors challenge governments to design and implement two
 new complementary ways of assessing governments performance  The
 first set of measures consists of a holistic approach to
 government performance along the four axes defined earlier as
 FAST    The second set of measures focuses on measuring
 the value of such transformation to citizens  If where it says government , you read corporations , and where it says citizens , you
 read clients , then you get a blueprint for private
 government  Prying farther into what the future holds in store for us, Mr 
 Schwab s team partnered with the editors of Britain s leading
 science journal, Nature, and came up with a series of X
 Factors , five of which are truly revolutionary
 game-changers  Just take a look at them, and then let s infer what might lie
 behind the curtain: 1) Runaway climate change: Is it possible that we have
 already passed a point of no return and that Earth s atmosphere
 is tipping rapidly into an inhospitable state? This
 ties in nicely with the Elite s proposal of imposing a Global
 Carbon Tax backed by the coming world government s legal
 framework, which will serve as a tool to control every country,
 region, city, and individual by allocating carbon credits based
 on their carbon footprint , thereby globally controlling
 all permissible activity  2) Significant cognitive enhancement: Ethical dilemmas akin
 to doping in sports could start to extend into daily working
 life; an arms race in the neural enhancement of combat troops
 could also ensue  Such scientific and technological
 breakthroughs are all basically controlled through the global
 network of mega corporate high-tech laboratories    We have
 an example in Monsanto s patenting of genetically modified seeds;
 the leitmotiv is to impose uncrackable, unhackable, high-tech and
 secret encoding over just about every resource on planet Earth:
 from seeds to sports competitions; from NSA eavesdropping to
 military gear  The coming world government will reserve for its
 exclusive use specific override code factors that will allow them
 to take over communications systems, power grids and aircraft 
 military and civilian, in flight and on the ground (9/11
 Conspiracy Theorists take note!)  3) Rogue deployment of geo-engineering: Technology is now
 being developed to manipulate the climate; a state or private
 individual could use it unilaterally  As if we
 did not know about Project HAARP High Frequency Active Auroral
 Research Program based in Alaska and Norway which has been
 undoubtedly playing dirty tricks all over the world, creating
 droughts and flooding!! It appears that HAARP installations can generate directed high
 power electromagnetic standing waves over specific geographical
 areas that interfere with weather fronts, stopping rain clouds in
 their tracks  This can lead to too much rain on one side
 (floods) and too little rain on the other (droughts) of these
 invisible standing waves  Also, as geologists well know, certain high power precisely aimed
 radio frequencies can be made to resonate with tectonic plates
 that are ready to slip ; so with the right data the HAARP
 weapon might be used to trigger earthquakes/seaquakes that are
 ready to happen   4) Costs of living longer: Medical advances are prolonging
 life, but long-term palliative care is expensive  Covering the
 costs associated with old age could be a struggle  A
 warning: The mysterious and anonymous Georgia Guidestones erected
 in 1980 in Ebert, Georgia which read like the global
 commandments, starts off by recommending the elites maintain
 humanity under 500 000 000, in perpetual balance with
 nature     Global depopulation is a-coming ¦ 5) Discovery of alien life: Proof of life s existence
 elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological
 implications for human belief systems  What a
 convincing way to bring on world government almost
 overnight!   In a Speech at the UN in 1987, former US
 President Ronald Reagan asked how quickly our differences
 worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from
 outside this world  And yet, I ask is not an alien force ALREADY
 among us? Hmmm ¦ Contact with alien life forms would demand a unified
 representation for all of mankind; yes indeed: a world
 government    And, of course, over the past 70 years,
 Hollywood has mentally programmed the world to accept that any
 such contact would be with the Elite s key representative, the
 United States  If one day soon little green men from Mars were to
 tell any human, take me to your leader , the proper
 landing strip will, of course, be the White House lawn  The think-tankese conclusion: The Global Risks Report is the
 flagship research publication of the World Economic Forum s Risk
 Response Network providing an independent platform for
 stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate on building
 resilience to global risks  Translation: Whoever controls the global agenda, the politically
 correct limits of debate and technological change, has an awfully
 huge edge over the rest of mankind, whether they are grouped by
 regions, nations, ideologies, demographics, raw material wealth,
 or whatever  Actually, all this rings much more like an attempt at generating
 self-fulfilling prophecies, rather than on trying to understand
 how to tackle the world s future problems  Goethe was right: coming events do cast their shadows
 forward    The global elites mad drive to impose world
 government on all of us is exactly that: an increasingly dark
 shadow bent on dragging us all into the darkest night  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/world-economy-power-brokers-forum-996/
"19 Apr, 2013",Gold bounces back but for good?,"Gold is on the rebound after a 4 5% drop this week, and the plunge has triggered serious concern about the condition of the global economy  The Comex index has passed the $1,400 mark, gaining 21 5 points
to $1,412 60 an ounce at 15:17 DST  We are already seeing a strong response to the fall in
prices, with a sharp pick-up in physical gold sales by investors
and retail consumers in the two key consumer markets - India and
China, Mark Pervan, head of commodity strategy at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group, wrote toBloombergtoday  While the value of the biggest gold producers declined by $169
billion, jewelers took advantage of the 30-year record-low gold
prices to stock up for anticipated high demand retail and jewelry
sales  Chinese and Indian jewelers are optimistic that gold will
rebound as much as 29% by December 2013, to as high as $1,800 an
ounce, as demand increases, according to billionaire Indian jeweler
T S Kalyanaraman,Reutersreported  There s been continued buying interest, particularly into
China, Nigel Moffatt, treasurer of Australia s Perth Mint said
on Bloomberg Television Friday  Americans took advantage of the price dip to buy stock in a
historically high yielding investment  In April, the US Mint sold 153,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins, a three year high, according to its website  The recent slump in gold has been paired with disturbing
economic data forecasting significant slowing in some of the
world s largest economies   the US,China, andRussia  The gold drops are ""signaling concerns about global growth,""
said Mohamed El-Erian, the co-chief investment officer of PIMCO,
which oversees $2 trillion in assets,Reutersreported  ""Commodities have been sending the signal on growth for a
while, and now even louder,""El-Erian added  Gold has certainly been the loudest of the flailing indexes,
after it plunged 14% in the first two April sessions, hitting a
30-year low as slowed growth data from the US and China trickled
in  Prices also dropped as the Cypriot bailout payment plan toyed
with the idea of selling 75% of their reserves to help finance the
bailout, which spooked investors other cash-strapped European
states, like Spain and Portugal, might do the same  The economic slowdown was confirmed by the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday when it trimmed back its forecast on
economic growth in 2013, down to 3 3% from the earlier 3 5%
projection  Citigroup predicted, and was correct, that 2013 would be the
first year when commodity prices at the end of the year were lower
than at the beginning  Citigroup predicted the end of the super-cycle when rising
prices commodities supersede demand  As growth slows, governments are scrambling to find a way to
stay afloat  Most governments are doing this via cash stimulus-
simply printing more money to avoid deflation, the Bank of Japan
the premier example  The recent retreats in gold, oil, and other precious metals and
energy stocks, are evidence to many of a weak - and maybe slightly
unstable - economy  Because metals and energy are so closely tied
to industrial growth, a decline in their demand can provide an
accurate reading of an global economic performance  As inflation falls, this in turn reduces the value of gold as a
fortification against rising prices  If investors forecast an
inflation dip, gold will also lose its value  ""Because the global economy is on the downside of a global
credit bubble, it seems unreasonable to expect abnormal
inflation,""said Richard Bernstein, the head of an investment
advisory firm in New York,Reutersreported  Gold, a major investment for both individuals and institutions,
provides a viable alternative to currency that their government can
just print more of  It also provides and investment alternative to

quarter  He predicted the prices would tumble, and wasn't sure how
quickly they d recover  The title of JPMogran s gold futures report is The slide in

liquidation, stop-loss and capitulation selling in the face of a
concerted short sale Peter Richardson, a Morgan Stanley analyst,
wrote in a report  According to JPMorgan s report, it s not a time to invest, or
reinvest in gold  Merrill Lynch recently warned that gold could fall to $1,200
before stabilizing, citing ""fears of disinflation combined with
news of potential central bank gold selling, in their Tuesday
report  ""Even at these levels, gold is still not attractive  The odds

hideaways  And they say they won t turn over the files to government agencies

million files has cracked open the secrets of more than 120,000
offshore companies and trusts, exposing the hidden dealings of
politicians, con men and the mega-rich the world over  The secret
records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists lay bare the names behind covert companies and private
trusts   They omit to mention how ICIJ obtained such a
cache Their selected scandals so far has hit French President Hollande,
Greek billionaires or Russian oligarchs  No scandal has hit the US

dealers, oligarchs, financial fraudsters and hundreds of Germans 
For owning an offshore account?The ICIJ groupclaims, The hoard of documents represents
the biggest stockpile of inside information about the offshore
system ever obtained by a media organization    more than 160 times
larger than the leak of U S  State Department documents by
Wikileaks in 2010  For anyone with knowledge of how tightly controlled mainstream
global media is, the names of the newspapers the ICIJ chose to
analyze the documents include BBC and The Guardian in the U K , The
Washington Post, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Le
Monde in France, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung in Germany, The Washington
Post, among others  UK Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to
use his leadership of the G8 to help crack down on tax evasion and
money laundering  While the mainstream world press is focusing on the leaks, it s
relevant to ask just who is this ICIJ leaker?According to their website, the ICIJ was founded in 1997 as a
project of the Center for Public Integrity to extend the
Center s style of watchdog journalism  Among financial donors
to ICIJ are Open Society Foundations, which have been involved in
many countries targeted by the US State Department for regime
change or color revolutions including Georgia, Ukraine, Burma
(Myanmar), Libya  The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of
Hewlett Packard founder and former Assistant Defense Secretary
David Packard, among others But the more interesting organization is the one which created
ICIJ: the Center for Public Integrity, which shares the same office
floor with ICIJ  Here we find a creation of the most powerful
families of Wall Street and US political establishment  The Center
for Public Integrity was created in 1989 to enhance
democracyby revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal
of trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the
tools of investigative journalism    Sounds noble
enough Notably, however, listed funders in 2012 of the Center include the
Ford Foundation, documented in the Cold War to work intimately with
the CIA; George Soros Open Society Foundations; John D  &
Catherine T  MacArthur Foundation; billionaire Wall Street banker
Sandy Bernstein s Sanford C  Bernstein & Co , LLC; GE
Foundation; Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller Family
Fund Now what do America s crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of powerful families and
bankers find so compelling about financing an organization of
journalists who now hold documents allegedly containing material
that could be used to blackmail governments and politicians and
businessmen around the globe? Are their offshore holdings to be
exposed along with those of Russians or French or Germans?The relevant question is what agency would have the capacity to
hack international computer data banks and secret encrypted banking
offshore records to give to ICIJ? The methodology of the ICIJ suggests another agenda at play  A
global witch-hunt against private fortunes legal or illegal has
begun  No longer is it a former employee of UBS or another Swiss
bank who steals data files of a few secret German clients to give
German tax authorities as an act of conscience  Now all offshore
accounts in the world can presumably be exposed as ICIJ
decides James S  Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey & Company,estimatesthat wealthy individuals have $21
trillion to $32 trillion in private financial wealth tucked away in
offshore havens The question is what agency or agencies of which governments have
the espionage facilities to pull off such a massive global hacking
of all offshore bank accounts?William A  Hamilton was involved in the Reagan years with a project
that the National Security Agency initiated to interdict the sale
of embargoed technology to the Soviet Union  In a recent exchange
with the author regarding the source for the ICIJ files on global
offshore accounts, Hamilton noted, NSA is one and perhaps the only
obvious candidate  He added that in the 1980s the NSA obtained
a copy of [Hamilton s software] PROMIS from the US Department of
Justice and arranged for copies to be installed on computers in the
banking sector (wire transfer clearing houses the World Bank major
commercial and investment banks worldwide) to facilitate NSA's
real-time electronic surveillance    Clearly in the
intervening three decades the NSA international banking covert
espionage capabilities must have been upgraded There is a role for genuine honest investigative journalism, but
the Secrecy for Sale project of the ICIJ smells like a massive US
Government-sponsored blackmail or worse against the rest of the
world s wealth  As Rockefeller family protÃ©gÃ© Henry Kissinger
reportedly said during the 1970 s, If you control the money, you
control the entire World F  William Engdahl can be reached through his website at

China s growth disappoints analysts and markets,"China s economic growth has lost momentum, its GDP expanded 7 7% in the first quarter, missing the 7 9% benchmark of the previous quarter, a sobering reality that global recovery is slowing  China has been coined by America as an economic sleeping
giant : a power that will suddenly awake at any moment and
supersede the US as the world s biggest economy  But the numbers are telling a different story   
According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics in
Beijing, the GDP missed its forecast, an indicator that even China
isn t immune to global recession  The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen on the GDP news and is
down 10% from an early February high  It fell 1 1% on Monday down
to 2,181 94 at market close, the lowest level since December
24  The disappointing data shows the recovery is much weaker and
bumpier than expected, dragged down by soft domestic demand, Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, told
Bloomberg  In a speech in Frankfurt last week, billionaire investor George
Soros warned that Germany is heading for a recession of its own
making, which Soros predicts will hit in September  The IMF has trimmed its forecast for US growth, predicting it
will only expand 1 7% instead of the forecasted 2%, according to a
draft of the World Economic Outlook obtained by Bloomberg  The Tiger Index (Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic
Recovery) a sort of pulse rating of the global financial
condition,has deemed the
economy""unable to achieve
lift-off and facing the risk of stalling"", according Professor Eswar Prasad, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution  Sell, sell, sell  That is what the Standard & Poor s GSCI
gauge of 24 raw materials indicates Monday's market trend, as the
index has dropped 1 34% on the New York exchange  Silver dipped
more than 11% to $23 93 an ounce in New York, also nearing record
lows  Gold fell below 9 35%, a 30 year lower, below $1,400 an
ounce  The demise of gold is still at an early stage, Georgette Boele, a commodities strategist at ABN Amro Group NV told
Bloomberg  Gold first tumbled on the rumored sale of Cypriot reserves as
part of their bailout package  The island-in-crisis planned to sell
excess gold reserves to raise $525 million, which triggered panic
that other indebted euro countries would copycat  WTI crude has fallen to a nine month low , dropping for a second
day to $88 56 on Asian markets and opening under $90/barrel on the
New York exchange  The fall came after the World Bank cut its
economic forecast for China's growth from 8 4% down to 8 3%  With a
US surplus of crude and declining demand, analysts haven t ruled
out prices below $85 in the coming month  The US currently consumes
21% of the world s crude oil, and China, 11%  Iceland and China are expected to sign a trade agreement on
Monday that will boost exports from the tiny isolated island to the
world s second largest economy  Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir is on a five-day
tour of China, on the lookout to expand its export market after the
banking bubble burst of 2008 left the Nordic economy crippled  A Chinese-Icelandic
partnership is something to watch closely, as Iceland s proximity
to the melting Arctic is opening up new potential trade routes, and
possibly natural resource exploration -gas, oil, diamonds, gold,
and iron- all resources any up-and-coming superpower should have
its eyes on  President Putin has acknowledged the lagging global crisis, but
at the same time, has suggested that Russia is an anomaly to the
surrounding stunted growth  The global crisis is acquiring an increasingly dangerous
shape, which inevitably affects us as well,""he said at a
meeting with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Monday  Last year s
economic performance, by Putin s account,""was good in
general "" In contrast to our friends and partners in Europe
andother regions of the world, the Russian
economy demonstrates viability and potential for further
development,""said Putin  Putin reported a wage drop, but stated the figures were above
projected levels, and remains optimistic, boasting Russia s
extractive industries are due to increase production  Dmitry Medvedev will give a similar follow-up report on April

"6 Apr, 2013",Boao Forum: Chinese convention rivals Davos,"When people hear economic forum the first thing they probably think about is Davos and snowy Alps  But that is set to change as China s Boao hosts the largest and most representative economic summit in Asia  The rapid rise of the so-called Asian tigers has shifted the
focus eastwards, when it comes to world economic development 
Initiated by China in 2001, the Boao Forum focuses not only on
Asian economic issues, but also address global political and
economic problems  The 12th Boao Forum in 2013 has already proven to be a truly
global, not just Asian event, once again bringing the world's
attention to the emerging nations' ever growing economic clout  Heads of state, business leaders and Nobel Prize winners,
altogether 1,477 representatives from 43 countries and regions have
all gathered in China to discuss pressing global issues  This is the largest [economic] forum in Asia, Ksenia
Yudaeva, Russia's representative for G20 summit preparations, told
RT  Here you can see that Asia is the new center of world s
economic growth  This year the forum is attracting some big names, like
Microsoft's Bill Gates, investor George Soros and head of the IMF
Christine Lagarde  The vision of that forum is really comparable to Davos in
representation of speakers of Europe, the US and Asian countries  I
would call it an Asian Davos, said Yudaeva, who also occupies
position of chief of the Presidential Experts' Directorate in
Russia  While Europe and the US are battling economic recession, China s
trade volume is growing steadily  For many countries China has
already become the number one trade partner, a place previously
occupied by the US  So there is little wonder that world leaders
and business gurus from countries affected by the crisis are
flocking to China s tropical Hainan Island for some advice and,
hopefully, remedy  Unlike a BRICS summit, which is largely a government to
government thing, the Boao Forum serves different purposes,
because it deepens contact between the civil society, business
and academics professor of political studies at the University
of Manitoba, Rhadika Desai, told RT  One really important thing about this is that they are going
to move away from hub-and-spoke relationship that the developing
countries once had with the Western world and the advanced
industrial countries and began to create more contacts,
investment and trade amongst themselves, said Desai, who has
written extensively on the rise of emerging economies  The global economic crisis made the Eastern countries realize
that the best way to deal with crisis is to widen your domestic
market to engage it a lot more and make it the driver of growth 
This is very important for laying the foundation for sustainable
long-term autonomous [economic] growth, she stressed  The old export-led [economic] growth model, which was being
followed and prescribed in the pre-crisis era, is basically
defunct  It could work as long as the US was able and willing to
observe the goods of the Western world, but as we know, it observed
it at the cost of giving excessive crediting to the rest of the
world, Desai concluded  The BRICS countries have recently signed an agreement to trade
in their own national currencies, not the US dollar  That move is
expected to eventually ditch the American currency  Rumors about
China s yuan becoming one of the world s reserve currencies have
been discussed for quite some time already  Washington has for years been accusing Beijing of manipulating
the exchange rate of Chinese national currency to gain some trade
advantages  But China rejects all allegations, demonstrating
resilience in diplomacy and independence in economic
decision-making  ",https://www.rt.com/news/boao-forum-asia-davos-429/
"20 Feb, 2013",Not so precious anymore: Gold losing its shine as global economy spreads its wings,"The price of gold is tumbling and has reached $1609 an ounce which is 10% less than its October high of $1798 10  According to some analysts, the main reason for the fall is
growing economic stability in the world  An improving global
economy reduces the appeal of gold as the safe harbor it is usually
considered as by buyers during harsh times  While the perspective
doesn t look exactly cheerful right now, with Europe s recession
deepening in 4Q 2012 as its economy shrank 0 6%, it still seems as
if things are starting to look up  Particularly, the US economy is
raising its head as the Federal Reserve may end its third round of
stimulus measures  We re probably very close to seeing panic lows in the price
of gold, says Ronald Stoeferle, an analyst at Incrementum
Advisors AG , a Swiss-based financial services firm, in an
interview with The Globe and Mail  Generally Central Banks buy gold as a defense against
hyperinflation  However, at the beginning of 2013 there was no
sharp increase in inflation, which did not meet investors'
expectations  As a result, investors and Central Banks started
cutting their positions in gold, which led to the price falling 
However, if inflation in Europe, the United States and China grows,
gold prices might start climbing again in 2Q 2013, Andrey
Shenk, an economic analyst from Moscow based Investcafe, told
RT  Another fact that triggered the fall of the precious metal s
price was the liquidation of a large part of the gold held by major
speculators, including billionaire George Soros who cut his holding
in one of the major gold investment funds by nearly $100 million in
the fourth quarter of 2012  Gold demand has also been weak in two major markets of the
world, China and India  In China all business was put on hold
during the Chinese New Year holidays last week  In India where gold
has traditional cultural uses less is being sold due to high import
taxes introduced by the government in an effort to improve the
country s trade balance  As of now,the world's biggest buyer of goldis Russia as its
Central Bank acquired 570 metric tons during the last decade, an
amount almost triple the weight of the American Statue of
Liberty  Russia's numbers are no surprise, as the country is a big
gold producer  As an export-oriented country it needs large gold
and foreign currency reserves to balance the books, and it is more
efficient to buy gold on the domestic market  Thus, during the last
decade Russia has been buying around 60-70% of the gold it produces
for its gold reserves, Shenk explained to RT  The metal was perceived as an economic buffer and also proven a
sound investment and opportunity for the Russian state to make
money, with gold prices crawling upwards over the past 12 years,
gaining 12% in 2012 alone, though the tables could be turning right
now  ",https://www.rt.com/business/gold-down-economy-stability-138/
"11 Feb, 2013","Russia emerges as world's top gold buyer, adding 570 metric tons in last decade","Over the last decade Russia s Central Bank acquired 570 metric tonnes of gold  The amount is almost triple the weight of the American Statue of Liberty and makes Russia the world s biggest buyer of gold  The amount is a qurter more than runner-up China, Bloomberg reported on Monday Countries like Russia and China use such stockpiles as an economic buffer against another wave of economic crisis or US dollar devaluation, as both remain weary of the US Federal Reserve s stability and prefer to edge their bets on gold   It s also proven a sound investment and opportunity for the Russian state to make money, with gold prices crawling upwards over the past 12 years, gaining 12% in 2012 alone    On Monday gold traded at $1650 per ounce and analysts expect the price to keep growing in 2013 to reach $1825 by the end of the year  However French investment bank Natixis dampened the outlook by forecasting a drop in price to $1500 by 2014, Finmarket ru reports   But the link between high gold prices and falling crude has plagued Russia in the past  In 1998, when Russia defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt, it took 28 barrels of crude to buy an ounce of gold, according to Bloomberg research  Two years later, when Vladimir Putin came to power, an ounce was worth 11 5 barrels  By 2005 the ratio had dropped to 6 5 and that is when President Putin ordered his Central Bank to buy  In just a month the proportion of gold in Russia s total reserve rose from 2 2% to 3 5% In 2000 Vladimir Putin inherited a country with 384 metric tons of gold and more than doubled its gold reserve in 12 years   according to official data from World Gold Council, in October 2012 gold made up 9 6% of Russia s national forex reserve and stood at 936 7 metric tons However it is still far from its historic high in 1941 Russia held a record 2800 tons of the precious metal and thanks to these reserves successfully recovered after World War II Russia s gold rush still doesn t mean it tops the list of global gold owners  The United States holds the leading position with 8133 5 tons of gold which make 75 4% of country s total reserve  Germany runs second with 3391 3 tons and the IMF third with 2814 tons  China and Russia are sitting in sixth and eighth place respectively   China however is suspected of downplaying its actual volume of gold by 3-4 times, Zerohedge news website reports, and prepares to introduce Yuan as world s reserve currency  Back in 2009 China set a goal to overtake the US in the rankings  When the Chinese Central bank is ready to officially declare its actual gold reserve volume, world markets will experience serious problems, Zerohedge com believes   Major global investor and consulting adviser to the Obama administration, George Soros also appears to have a golden investment streak  In August 2012 it was reported, Mr  Soros offloaded over a million shares in financial companies and banks and purchased $130 million in gold  His move to sell stocks and beef up on gold, is being interpreted by some as a sign of changing investment strategy in the world market  ",https://www.rt.com/business/russia-biggest-gold-buyer-946/
"8 Jan, 2013",Europe of discord: What will become with euro in 2013?,"As the European debt crisis shows no signs of ending experts are divided on whether the Eurozone is doomed or the project is viable, even if some of its member drop out of the euro  The eurozone is headed for deeper, more intense, and much less retractable trouble in 2013  There is no foreseeable way for the region to recover as it exists today in its current form, economic expert Margaret Bogenrief from ACM Partners told RT With Greece s exit from the Eurozone looming and a lack of agreement between EU leaders on crisis fighting measures, the region s economy was on the verge of collapse several times last year  Root of the Greece In 2012 America s Citigroup raised the chances of Greece leaving the euro in the next year to 90% ""Over the next few years, the euro area end-game is likely to be a mix of EMU exit (Greece), a significant amount of sovereign debt and bank debt restructuring (Portugal, Ireland and, eventually, perhaps Italy, Spain and Cyprus) with only limited fiscal burden-sharing, Citigroup said in its July report Since 2009 when Greece s economy began falling apart under its huge debt burden the country has been dependent on international rescue loans with a total of ¬240 billion provided to Athens  As of now, ¬149 billion have been distributed to Greece from the Troika of international lenders That hardly solves all of Greece s problems, and experts seriously considered the scenario of Greece s default and probable exit from the Eurozone  According to the ECB it would be manageable but very expensive, not only for the crisis-troubled country, but for the whole region  It would be associated with a loss of growth and higher unemployment and it would be very expensive in Greece, Europe as a whole and even in Germany, ECB policymaker Joerg Asmussen said in August His view is echoed by economic experts  ""Despite Greece receiving a commitment of 2 bailouts (totaling 240 bn euro from the EU, European Commission, and IMF), an implementation of strict austerity measures, and the Eurozone s agreement to cut the country s debts by a further 40bn euro, Greece s debt-to-GDP level is still predicted, as a best case scenario in 2020, to hit 124%,"" Bogenrief told RT She added: ""The EU has stretched itself to its near limit (in particular by having to request aid for outside sources, such as the IMF) merely keeping Greece (the 15th largest economy in the EU) within its economic borders"" By the end of the year Greece managed to gain back investor confidence  Standard & Poor's ratings agency upgraded Greece s credit grade to a B-, the highest since June 2011, although the bonds are still at junk status  Athens successfully accomplished a bond buyback, and reduced its debt by ¬20 billion  Trying to hold control of the economy at the end of 2012 Greece adopted a 2013 budget that involves ¬9 4 billion of spending cuts, mainly in state wages, pensions and benefits, all of which have already been significantly reduced over the past two years  The decision resulted in strikes and protest across the country  Tough austerity measures have also led to a drastic surge of unemployment   in the third quarter of 2012 it reached a record 24 8%, up from 17 7% during the same period in 2011 Greece s neighbor Cyprus also found itself on the verge of default, crippled by the losses on Greek bonds  S&P slashed Cyprus' credit rating by two notches to CCC+ last December  Cyprus's request for an EU bail-out, which could amount to ¬17 5 billion, will be considered by eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on 21 January  Cyprus s President has already said the international aid could cost the country its financial sovereignty  Earlier in 2012 the island nation got a ¬2 5 billion loan from the Russian government  Then three major companies provided the government with a ¬175m loan to stay afloat European creditors EU, IMF and ECB, said they consider a further reduction of Greece s debt if the country manages to achieve a significant primary surplus by 2016  Earlier they agreed to cut Greece s debt by ¬40 billion, reducing it to 124% of GDP by 2020 from around 190% in 2013  Hard times not over Europe saw its public debt reach 90% of the value of the union's economy at the end of the second quarter of 2012, according to the data provided by Eurostat  Meanwhile the total jobless rate in the eurozone reached a record high of 11 7%, meaning 19 million people in the bloc were out of work with Southern member countries among the worst affected Experts warn that though the situation in Greece is under better control now, the crisis still poses risk to euro stability  Unfortunately, the eurozone crisis is likely to remain with us for years to come, sustaining the likelihood of coercive debt restructurings and eurozone exits, Nouriel Roubini, a professor at NYU s Stern School of Business wrote in his article for Project Syndicate in December  The fundamental crisis of the eurozone has not been resolved, and another year of muddling through could revive these risks in a more virulent form in 2014 and beyond, Roubini said, citing Grexit and probable massive loss of market access in Italy and Spain So far the debt-stricken countries are determined to continue unpopular austerity reforms which have already resulted in mass protests across Southern Europe throughout 2012  The looming multi-billion bailout for Spain, Europe s fourth largest economy, has become a major headache for the eurozone  Last September Spain announced its plan for drastic economic reform, and a tight 2013 budget which includes 58% spending cuts and 42% increase in taxes  As the Spanish crisis spread several regions asked for bailout, while Catalonia, the country s richest region accounting for fifth of GDP turned down participation in the liquidity fund, the 18bn euro body set up by Madrid to finance troubled regions and called for independence  Saving the euro In 2012 eurozone countries managed to agree on two ambitious initiatives aimed at keeping the Eurozone afloat the establishment of a European stabilization fund and a banking union  The two instruments will be operational in various spheres: the European stabilizing fund will offer help to weak economies pumping money from the strong ones  EU has also agreed to appoint the ECB the single regulator for the biggest banks in the euro zone as a step towards a ""banking union,"" or common euro area approach to dealing with failing banks The only thing which European politicians do not want to do is to let debt-stricken countries carry out free floating  However, here they are pursuing their selfish interests, Chief of the Analytical Department of the IK Grandis Capital Denis Barabanov told the Voice of Russia ""The strong countries of the eurozone are getting big preferences and advantages as the members of the eurozone because on the one hand, they are killing rivalry in weaker countries and on the other hand, they always have a reliable and profitable commodity market, which enables them to sell highly competitive goods within the framework of their union,"" Barabanov said With all the efforts, even optimistic experts don t expect the Europe s economy to recover in the near future    In its new paper New Recession in the Eurozone S&P rating agency suggests the eurozone GDP will shrink by 0 8% in 2012  Growth in 2013 is expected to be zero compared to the earlier forecast of up 0 3%, according to the study Splitting the eurozone is still considered to be an option by some experts  Billionaire George Soros proposed Germany, Europe s so far best performing economy, should leave to save the Eurozone, among other options  ""The problem would disappear into thin air,"" as the value of the euro declines and yields on the bonds of debtor countries adjust, CNBC quoted Soros as saying  On the other hand, euro-sceptic and financial consultant Stephan Werhahn, grandson of a statesman seen as the architect of the EU, believes the euro should be limited to a handful of similar northern European countries, the Daily Mail reports  ""Europe will fail' if debt-stricken countries are forced to stick with the euro,"" Werhahn said However, Italy, Greece and Spain are very unlikely to leave the Eurozone, according to Maksim Zaytsev, senior analyst at Nord Capital Group  They have made significant progress over the recent months in reducing their budget deficit, Zaytsev told RT  Now their budget gaps are lower than 9%   a critical level when countries face problems with debt refunding  The ECB has also contributed to easing the situation in Europe, he added  ECB launched a bond-buying program which also supported debt markets, Zaytsev said  This program allows the ECB to buy bonds without limits while setting aside some funds to avert a risk of inflation    The 700bn euro European

"24 Sep, 2012",USAID looks for ways around Russian ban (Op-Ed),"Russia s Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave USAID until October 1 to shut its doors in Moscow  This is an excellent decision by the Russian Government  And Washington s immediate and virulent reaction only confirms that Russia is right on target  The New York Times next morning on the front page cited American officials who quickly pledged to maneuver around the Kremlin  Even before the public announcement, on Tuesday 18 September, US Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and USAID leadership met with their Russian partners  Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of the Golos Association one of the top recipients of USAID funding confirmed after the meeting that the agency is not going to leave Russia completely and they are brainstorming about how to reorganize  In the meantime, Ambassador McFaul announced that it will take at least a year for USAID to exit Russia, according to Bloomberg News Brainstorming on how circumvent the Russian government s decision instead of how to pack up faster is only one more demonstration of Washington s utter disrespect for another country s sovereignty  Indeed, there are a number of ways in which USAID can maneuver around its predicament Funding can be channeled directly from USAID headquarters in Washington to its Russian beneficiaries no need to go through a Moscow office USAID funding can be redirected through a great number of other US institutions, beginning with the National Endowment for Democracy and its four mandated institutes; private funds such as MacArthur, Soros s Open Society Institute, or Freedom House; universities Russia programs, etc To hide the American connection, USAID can channel funding through their partners in Ukraine, Poland or Georgia for their very active operations in the Caucuses; in this case the money entering Russia will be Ukrainian, Polish or, God forbid, Saakashvili s In October last year, USAID signed an agreement with Cisco Systems on joint 50/50 funding of Cisco Networking Academies for Public Service Program  Cisco and other major US corporations may continue running USAID programs A year ago Michael McFaul announced an initiative to create a new US$50 million fund, essentially an endowment for a private foundation established under Russian law for Russian civil society groups Washington may use any combination of these and other possibilities  One way to put an end to USAID activities in Russia is not only to close their Moscow office, but to insist on shutting down all USAID programs and funding for Russia  This is American taxpayers money give it back to the American people, use it to help them pay mortgages instead of throwing families out of their homes Obviously, USAID cannot be allowed to stay in Moscow beyond the set date  This delay will only serve to build up additional infrastructure people and organizations to run operations remotely The main lament of the Western press has been about how hard USAID closure will hit the sick, disabled, mothers, newborns and other children that the agency helps  Well, let s take a look at USAID leadership to see how well they are suited for healthcare services Director of USAID/Russia Charles North, according to its official biography is a 2004 graduate of the National War College, with an MS Degree in National Security Strategy   Earlier North served as Senior Deputy Director of USAID's Afghanistan and Pakistan Task Force, and helped launch a presidential initiative to support Mexico and Central America in battling organized crime and drug trafficking In Washington, Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia until last year was Douglas Menarchik: a 26-year career US Air Force officer, Vietnam veteran with 211 combat missions, assistant for terrorism policy at the Pentagon, where he developed the Defense Department's Strategic Plan for Combating Terrorism, military advisor to the vice-president of the United States with a portfolio including terrorism and low intensity conflict  Earlier Menarchik was instructor at the Air Force Special Operations School, teaching combating terrorism and counter insurgency But that s not all  If you check Charles North s bio on USAID site, you will see a new updated version that excludes his National War College stint  However, a cached copy of his true biography is still available and this snapshot shows the page as it appeared on September 14, 2012  Someone was cleaning house a few days before the public announcement Enough tales about healthcare dispensed by US military and national security cadre  USAID out  Russia must take care of its own civil society, ill and disabled by itself instead of outsourcing it to Washington  Russia s shutting USAID operations is also an excellent example for any other country where USAID operatives still work on winning hearts and minds of the local population ",https://www.rt.com/russia/usaid-security-russia-ngo-848/
"13 Jul, 2012",West's battle for Russian hearts and minds : NGOs on steroids (Op-Ed),"The Russian Duma has just passed amendments to the Russian NGO law  Russian NGOs receiving foreign funding will now have to register at the Ministry of Justice as an NGO carrying out functions as a foreign agent , make public their sources of funding by marking it on the materials they distribute, and report semi-annually to the Ministry of Justice on their activities This law, a great majority of Russians believe, is long overdue  In the past 25 years, billions of dollars have been pouring into Russia from the US State Department and its subsidiary agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID   nearly $3 billion alone), as well as from so-called private foundations like the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, and George Soros s Open Society Institute  All of these institutions, judging by their activities and leadership s biographies, have important ties to the US State Department, the intelligence community, Cold War and the color revolutions  The goal of all this money was not to express Washington s generous love of Russia, its culture or its people  In addition to building a loyal infrastructure, it aimed at winning hearts and minds and along the way oil, gas, and military capacity  It has all been about opening open society , open economy , open Russia , open government open for brainwashing, economic plunder, for hijacking Russia s domestic and foreign policies  Conquest by war is always an option for the US, as we have seen in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and now in Syria  But victory without war is cheaper and more effective, as the collapse of Soviet Union has tragically shown  What did Western funding do to the Russian civil society while pursuing military objectives by peaceful means ? Might it have accidentally contributed to building democracy in Russia? The word democracy here is understood in its original sense, as government of the people for the people, not in Washington s interpretation as a loyal regime subservient to US interest  In fact, the multibillions of Western funding have profoundly distorted Russian civil society  A marginal pro-American group of NGOs that was pumped up with US dollars like a bodybuilder with steroids -it has gained much muscle and shine  Those few Russians willing to serve foreign interests were provided nice offices, comfortable salaries, printing presses, training, publicity, and political and organizing technology which gave them far more capacity, visibility, and influence that they could possibly have had on their own  Money and spin are the only means to promote unpopular ideas, alien to national interests  On the other side is the silent majority of people who is squeezed out of the public space  In Western, and also in Russian media, civil society turns out to be represented by Ludmila Alekseyeva (The Helsinki Group), Boris Nemtsov and Gary Kasparov, rather than by a worker from the Urals, teacher from Novosibirsk or a farmer from Krasnodar Region Moreover, Russian NGOs not addicted to Western funding are put under serious pressure from Western funders and their local outlets to join the club  Once the Russian organization shows its effectiveness, its leadership receives a call from US Embassy, and an invitation to visit  Money offers follow shortly  If the Russian NGO dares to refuse the bait, one or several mirror organizations are created that, with massive funding and publicity, hijack the subject, fill it out with its agenda and occupy the field  For projects in education, for example, suddenly it will be all Anglo-Saxon models and values  For projects fighting abuse by the police, this fight will be selective and serving to compile incriminatory evidence on loyal officials designed to create hostility to the government in general, rather than truly fighting these intolerable practices  In the field of business associations, one Russian NGO was denounced by a major US-allied corporation for excessively defending the rights of domestic producers   No, Western funding does not contribute to strengthening Russian democracy  It only extends the battle field for pro-American forces against patriotic forces  Like steroids, Western funding is injected in the weaker spots of the targeted civil society  Like steroids, it is addictive  Like steroids, it corrupts the mind and body of the political organism  It transforms the target nation into a sick and dependent collaborating entity deprived of independent will, mind, and heart  Russia and other countries subject to Western funding infusions must take charge of their domestic problems  Building a patriotic civil society cannot be outsourced  Democratic processes and national security cannot be outsourced all the more so to openly hostile governments  These NGO amendments, by correcting an evident gap in our laws, take a major step in leveling the playing field  But this step needs to be followed by further measures that strengthen our national civil societies  Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-ngo-usa-funding-101/
"9 Jul, 2012",Washington s new tricks on the road to global dominance (Op-Ed),"The latest round of the war against an independent Syria unfolded in Paris last week at the gathering of the Friends of Syria   Russia and China very rightly did not attend this amoral in the diplomatic language of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting  At the meeting western champions of the war insisted on their interpretation of the one-week old Geneva agreements: transition government based on mutual consent means Bashar al-Assad must go , affirmed French President Hollande This recent round of pressure highlights two new tactics employed by Washington: word games and an end-run around the United Nations itself First, the new formula transition government   The authoritative Merriam-Webster dictionary defines regime as government and change as transition  Thus, for those who reject regime change, a euphemism was created that has much better chances to go through Interestingly enough, this term was promoted by an expert of Russian origin, Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center  On June 28, 2012 Trenin published a suggestion in his piece Syria: A Russian Perspective : Russia might be willing to cooperate with the U S  and other countries if the goal moves towards transition rather than regime change   what has been dubbed the Yemen model  So who is Mr  Trenin? This retired Soviet colonel was a Senior Research Fellow at the NATO Defense College in Rome just before he was recruited in 1993 to join the Carnegie Moscow Center, created the same year by none other than Michael McFaul, the current US Ambassador in Moscow  After nearly 20 years in the pay of the Americans Trenin was rewarded with his current post as director by his former boss, Rose Gottemoeller, who left Moscow in 2008 to join the State Department where she is now Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security  Big shoes to fill for Mr Trenin, but in Washington they know how to pick their cadre The board of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington features this world is truly small Kofi Annan himself  Among the Endowments Funders and Supporters are George Soros s Open Society Institute, the US National Intelligence Council, the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Defense Department, and a collection of other private and public enthusiasts Of course the transition government and Yemen model are nothing other than regime change  Honestly: we, Russians, brought up on Tolstoy and Chekhov, should be able to miss Washington s elementary-school semantic traps Secondly, unable to push anti-Syrian resolutions through the UN Security Council due to Russia and China s staunch resistance, Washington is building up a group of more than hundred nations more pliable to US pressure  Such coalitions of the willing have been put together before, but this time the number of countries makes it look like a parallel anti-UN construct acting as if it is replacing the UN General Assembly itself Such a gathering, despite total absence of legitimacy, is not just a talking platform  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told Le Parisien that the Paris meeting would push for a Chapter VII United Nations resolution to enforce the transition plan  A Chapter VII resolution can authorize the use of military force ""to maintain or restore international peace and security ""In the short term, the United States may attempt to institutionalize this ad hoc grouping into a mechanism to implement a final solution to President Al-Assad  In the long term, Washington may try to solidify such structure into an anti-U N  body of sycophants, ready and willing to approve any U S  initiative Now, from tactics to strategy  Looking at the type of leaders that are seizing power in the Arab world with American assistance, a normal person is perplexed: why does the United States, with assistance of their local satellites, keep on removing moderate secular governments and bringing to power, in one country after another, increasingly radical extremists that same type of people who committed 9/11, the greatest tragedy in U S  post-WWII history?Indeed, this question is not solvable by listening to Washington s official line of arguments  But take a look at the policies of the US and its European partners during the in the 1930s  Then, America and its ever so reasonable and civilized European allies provided the financial, industrial and political support encouraging the highly energized, violent extremist Nazi and fascist movements in Europe  With a purpose: to direct its violence against Russia  According to the plan, Germany and Russia were to exhaust themselves so that the US would emerge dominant Similarly, the earlier use of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and again today the encouragement of various Muslim extremists including elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are part of the plan to create a regional movement which could be thrown against Iran, Russia and China  Such a furnace of war and chaos in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia will permanently disable all three of America s strategic rivals and allow Washington to rise to uncontested world domination   We should be able to decipher not only US language, but also US strategy  In the 1930s, the Soviet Union was at the front line of the fight against Fascism in Europe  Today, Russia owes it to its history and to the fallen in the anti-fascist struggle to recognize and before it is too late avert American designs  We must prevent Russian and other people from being drawn into a bloodbath of mutual extermination in the voracious interest of Washington s drive for global hegemony  Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  ",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-syria-transition-721/

"23 Feb, 2012",Argentine advice for Greece: Default Now! ,"Here in Argentina, when we watch the terrible things that are happening today in Greece, we can only exclaim, Hey!! That s exactly what happened in Argentina in 2001 and 2002 ! A decade ago, Argentina too went through a systemic Sovereign Public Debt collapse resulting in social turmoil, worker hardship, rioting and street fights with the police   Some months before Argentina exploded, then-President Fernando de la RÃºa forced to resign at the height of the 2001 crisis had called back as finance minister the notorious pro-banker, Trilateral Commission member and Rockefeller/Soros/Rhodes protÃ©gÃ©e Domingo Cavallo  Cavallo was the gruesome architect of Argentina s political and economic capitulation to the US and UK when he was President Carlos Menem s foreign minister and economy minister in the 90s  Menem and Cavallo are primarily responsible for Argentina s signing of a formal Treaty of Capitulation with the UK/US after the 1982 Falklands War, opening up our economy to unrestricted privatization, deregulation and grossly excessive US Dollar-indebtedness, almost tripling our sovereign debt in a few short years (see my February 11, 2012 article British Laughter in the Falklands)   The Plan? Prepare Argentina for planned weakening, bankster take-over and collapse, so that a new weakening-takeover-collapse cycle could begin      In 2001, Cavallo was back to finish his work During that very hot summer in December 2001, true to its Latin temperament, Argentina even had four (yes, 4!) presidents in just one week    One of them, Adolfo Rodriguez SÃ¡a, who only lasted three days, at least did one thing right, even if he did it the wrong way: he declared Argentina s default on its sovereign debt  All hell broke loose! The international bankers and IMF did everything they could to break Argentina s back; global media pundits predicted all kinds of impending catastrophes  Debt default meant Argentina would have to weather the pain and agony alone, being cast out by the international financial community   But no matter how bad it got, it would always be better to do that without the bankers, without the IMF s, European Central Bank s, US Fed s and US Treasury s help     Better to sort out your mess on your own, than to have parasitic banker vultures carving out their pound of flesh from your nation s decaying social and economic body And how bad did it get in 2002? A 40 per cent drop in GDP; 30 per cent unemployment; 50 per cent of the population fell below the poverty line; dramatic, almost overnight, devaluation against the US Dollar from 1 peso per dollar to 4 pesos per dollar (then it tapered down to 3 pesos per dollar); if you had a US dollar Bank account, the government forced you to change it into pesos at the rate of 1 40 pesos per dollar What did Argentina s government do wrong?   In the months leading to collapse it bowed to all the bankers and IMF-mandated measures and recipes , which were actually the very cause of collapse: Argentina was loaned far more than it could pay back     And the banker knew it!   This was described in our December 19, 2011 article, Argentina: Tango Lessons    Successive governments since then have continued to be functional to banker interests by rolling over debt 30 to 40 years, aggregating huge interest and in 2006 paying the full debt to the IMF almost US$10 billion in full, cash and in US dollars (sole entity given most-favoured creditor status)  Today, Greece is confronted with a similarly tough decision    Either it keeps its sovereignty, or it capitulates to the Vulture Troika the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund   who work for the Bankers, not the People Not surprisingly, today we find that Greece too has a Trilateral Commission Rockefeller/Rothschild man at the helm: Lucas Papademos who is doing the same things Argentina did in 2001/2       Argentina not only suffered Cavallo, but President De la RÃºa himself was co-founder of the local Global Power Masters lobby, CARI Argentine International Relations Council local branch of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, networking with the Trilateral Commission / Bilderberg mafia Greece today should do what Argentina did a decade ago: better to endure pain and hardship, and sort out the mess made by your politicians in connivance with international bankers on your own, wielding whatever shred of sovereignty you still have than allowing the Banker Vultures sitting in Frankfurt, New York and London decide your future  Or do you think it s just bad luck, bad judgment and coincidence that countries Greece, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Iceland, Ireland, Russia, Malaysia, Ukraine, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, France, even the US and UK always borrow too much from the bankers and then discover that they cannot pay it back and that, symmetrically, the same bankers CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche, Commerz, BNP, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorganChase, BBVA lend too much to countries and then discover they cannot collect?No!   That is the very yellow-brick road that leads to the Emerald City of   debt restructuring , debt refinancing , and sovereign debt bond mega-swaps that snowball sovereign debt, spreading it over 20, 40 or more years into the future  That guarantees unimaginably colossal interest profits for the Mega-Bankers and for all those nice politicians, media players, traders and brokers, without whom that would not be possible This is a Model    It must keep rolling and rolling and rolling As this Monster Machine steams forwards, it completely tramples on, overruns, destroys, flattens and obliterates people, jobs, workers, health services, pensions, education, national security and just about everything human on its path    Run by parasitic usurer technocrats, it does not care what it destroys because it has no ethics; no Christian, Muslim or Buddhist morals    It only worships a greedy golden idol of money, money and more money    This is 21st-century Money Power Slavery   Three generations of Argentines saw hopes dashed and dreams thwarted by this Monster Machine, suffering the hardship, woes and humiliations that come when countries give up sovereignty  So, Greece: Just default on your sovereign debt !   Just revert to the drachma!   Just say No, thanks! to the German bankers and the Troika Vultures     Please, Greece: just say No! to your Trilateral Commission president!    You will be setting a strong precedent for your European neighbours    Like Spain, which is hurting so badly right now for similar reasons    Like Italy, with its Trilateral Commission Prime Minister Mario Monti (also Trilateral s European Chairman!)   Greece, the Cradle of Democracy, can teach the world a lesson in True Democracy by kicking these parasites out of the country, which will hopefully trigger kicking them out of Europe and one day, kicking them out of the global economy  Because what Greece and Argentina and Italy and Spain suffer today is not True Democracy, but rather a distorted bastard imitation that systematically yields control to the Global Power Masters at the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg and Mega-Banking Overworld    They run the whole democracy show , whereby all countries end up having the best democracy that money can buy which is no democracy at all  The Money Power juggernaut is steaming full speed towards us all    If Greece falls, who ll be next? Spain? Italy? Portugal? Argentina (yet again!!!)? So what if Greece s reverting to the drachma marks the beginning of the end for the euro?   Let Italy revert to the lira, Spain to the peseta, Portugal to the escudo !   A National Currency is a key National Sovereignty factor All governments should understand that you either govern for the people and against the bankers; or you govern for the bankers and against the people  Adrian Salbuchi for RT Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and radio/TV commentator in Argentina  www asalbuchi com arDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in the story are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/news/argentina-advice-greece-default-033/
"15 Aug, 2011",Dining on the Euro s near death experience,"Take a currency, one widely used as a reserve currency, including by Russia, and expose it to the blowtorch of market examination of its fundamentals  It isn t pretty, and the Euro may be gone soon, if it the debt issue isn t comprehensively addressed  On the Menu memories of fellow leaders pastTomorrow s meeting between Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy will go a long way to determining the future of the Euro The simple question on the menu is whether they can put together the politics to save the Euro The politics isn t easy Almost every European leader from Papandreou in Greece, to the leaders in Ireland and Portugal who have introduced austerity, before heading to the electoral dustbin barely avoiding being tarred and feathered by their not so thankful electorates, and Spain where the election has been called, through to Berlusconi in Italy where the austerity is about to unfold, has shown where the politics is profoundly difficult But the finances are equally so After the bailout of Greece (twice) Ireland and Portugal the existing EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility), which was setup with a ¬440 billion now needs to encompass the possibility of coming to the aid of Spain, Italy, almost certainly Cyprus (which seems to have gone under the radar, but has a banking sector far bigger than its size would indicate and is surprisingly closely tied to Russia) and maybe other needs far more Italy and Spain alone have an estimated ¬2 2 Trillion in outstanding debt compared to ¬630 billion for the nations which have already received bailouts Settling past billsThe initial EFSF is built up through loans from existing Eurozone nations, plus a dollop from the IMF The nations contributing to it included those receiving bailouts, with nearly 1/3 coming from nations which have either received bailouts, or like Italy and Spain, are in the firing line That leaves any potential expansion in the hands of the larger or more solvent players, making France and Germany the twin pillars in terms of providing for its enlargement to ¬2 Trillion, with the need for their contributions to an enlarged EFSF already being factored in by markets, which explains in part some of the tremors in CDS swaps across the Eurozone in recent weeks They are starting to question even the AAA rated nations of the Eurozone and the implications of what is potentially a massive additional debt servicing need by them, in order to ensure an adequate bailout for the whole Eurozone To put that in context for theses nations it tends to represent an additional 14-20% of their standing debt, or generally adding about 8% of debt to GDP to their load Then there are additional concerns with any and every potential bond purchase part of the EFSF, with questions over coupon values, durations, interest rates, and net present values, not to mention how they get accounted for by the nations receiving funds, and how the EFSF marks these to market Dealing with haughty waitersThe other key factor in the malaise is the structure of the EFSF and its management It currently revolves around sovereign debt issues if the Eurozone nations individually, and is managed by the ECB The ECB has been buying bonds of the bailed out nations, plus those, belatedly, of Spain and Italy last week, while at the same time imposing a hard core dose of austerity every time upon the nations, as the price for stepping into the market Arguments rage back and forth, but there is certainly a case for thinking that in some cases the austerity involved is not just making the life harder in these nations, but largely ensuring they will not see any real economic growth for some time, and as a result further eroding their capacity to service their existing debt Against a backdrop of the ECB widely being seen as a key factor, through tightening rates too early and too far, in turning an nascent economic recovery into a near certain recession across much of the Eurozone, that is generating plenty of tension from aggrieved politicians having to tout austerity to those who vote for them at the behest of appointed officials Silvio Berlusconi s comments about bleeding hearts and looking like an occupied government, in the wake of getting the Italian parliament to agree to austerity measures on Friday encapsulates a mood which resonates strongly in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain Palatable and unpalatableThe meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel is expected to see the French leader push for the Eurozone to issue bonds backed by all 17 member nations  This would effectively entail the Eurozone developing the fiscal side critics have always maintained it lacks to go with its monetary side Supporting the contention is the fact that the need to contribute to the EFSF and its enlargement is actually corroding market confidence in the stronger nations, as seen in the market treatment of French banks and French debt in the last week That brings us back to another round of ugly politics Germans aren t terribly enthused about the prospect of bailing out their southern neighbours, and there is a constitutional challenge in Germany to the existing bailout  German resistance to any form of sharing responsibility for sovereign debts of other nations is profound, with Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble stating again on the weekend that ""There is no collectivisation of debt or unlimited support ""Germans are also aware that any thought of freeing the ECB from its need to sterilize its bond purchases and head off to flood money markets while buying distressed Euro sovereign debt could be highly inflationary, and potentially destabilizing for a nation which has prided itself on rock solid finances given that it would be required to provide most of the firepower enabling it to happen  The collection of centre right parties which comprise the majority in the Bundestag haven t been backward in denouncing any hint of easing up for their European neighbours, giving Chancellor Merkel precious little political leeway  Dessert anyone?But writing in the Financial Times on August 14, George Soros sums up the vital role of Germany, and the need for Europe to be able to convince Germany to change its approach if the Eurozone is to survive  Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany, and because eurobonds will put Germany s credit standing at risk, any compromise must put Germany in the driver s seat  Sadly, Germany has unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy, and it wants Europe to follow its example  But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe: no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits  Germany must agree to rules by which others can also abide  The other side of the equation is that flooding the markets with money, would potentially generate growth in the Eurozone which would lighten the debt servicing issue for those currently looking at exporting people due to the lack of opportunities at home  Currently the ECB doesn t have the scope for the scale of purchases needed, while ensuring these are sterilized So that leaves the Eurozone wondering if Sarkozy and Merkel can come to agreement on allowing the ECB to proceed with unsterilized debt purchases, agreeing to issue Eurobonds which would be heavily reliant on Germany, or if they can come up with a system or general idea which they can sell to politicians and publics across the EU that involves fiscal transfers, joint responsibility for existing debts, and will calm markets For if they come out with nothing more than glib statements, or more of the same it is a recipe for Euro and market chaos  James BlakeRT Business Internet

"13 Jul, 2011", Hundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis ,"The head of Russia's Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort  RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug-related deaths since the beginning of this year  At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people  How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning  That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed  A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses  The reason for most drug-related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world's third most heroin-consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq  Some people, such as Mr  Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty  What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government  According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence  For people not involved in gross drug-related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated  Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world  I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries  Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0 2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders  Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here  Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan's enormous drug production  As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country  This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000-kilometer border with Kazakhstan  RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe  Mostly it's the Netherlands, where most amphetamine-based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels    Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it's nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year  Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs  Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third-grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical  No, of course not  We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers  After all, people are not born addicted to drugs  It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents  That's when they get to know drugs If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments  If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No  We are not talking about forced treatment here  Any forced treatment is a violation of a person  Therefore it s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves  In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21]  They re punished, and then they re released Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction  However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances  Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment As I ve said, this is the so-called alternative responsibility  By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti-drugs fundamental conventions RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure  Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN  Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in this commission  I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US-Russia Presidential Commission  Mr  Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission  Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere  Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse  Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year  I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr  Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor  All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana  And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized  RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN  I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion  Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we ve been discussing at various international platforms  On May 10, I spoke at the G8 s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues  We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding  This concept hasn t been developed yet In this context, I want to note that the former Under-Secretary-General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008-2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world s leading banks  This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far  It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set  They ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000  Now, they are planning to return these 30,000  So, in fact, nothing has changed  I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least  This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference  It s longer than World War II  But the situation in Afghanistan hasn t improved, it has become even worse  And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year  In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse  It s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country  So, it s a kind of closed circle In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy  The operation was called  mashtarak  which, if translated from Persian, means  together   The operation was presented as a brilliant military success  Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary  We ve started talking about this need at long last  It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010  The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement  The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production I ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union  Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan  Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan The EU strategy matches very well a Russia-drafted plan called  Raduga-2  to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan  In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well  So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action  RT: Thank you very much for your interview VI: Thank you very much  RT News App  © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization  TV-Novosti , 2005 2021  All rights reserved  This website uses cookies  Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more  ",https://www.rt.com/news/hundreds-drug-money-pumped/

"10 Apr, 2011",George Soros looks to establish new global finance system,"A new global economic policy is on the table at a meeting in the American town of Bretton Woods  Economists, finance experts and scholars from across the world are gathered at the conference, held by billionaire George Soros  The chosen venue has great historic significance this was the setting of the famous Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, which set the monetary system for the world as we now know it This is where the International Monetary Fund and what is now the World Bank were established, with the US dollar becoming the reserve currency for the world at this same conference Back in 1944 it was the United Nations that got together the allied countries towards the end of World War II  However, today it is a very different story This time it is billionaire George Soros bringing together two hundred intellectuals, with the belief that the current economic thinking and the current world monetary policy systems are no longer working Since the financial collapse shook the globe and reverberated all across the world, there hasn t been anything to replace the old system, something which might reflect the new world, where the US is not the one singular power that dictates economic policy The idea among the thinkers in Bretton Woods is that there needs to be a system which reflects the fact that we live in a multi-polar world, a system which brings developing nations into the conversation  Many of those nations with booming economies have become rivals to developed nations such as the United States  So, you come to 2010, and for the first time virtually for nearly 200 years America and Europe that s the United States of America and the 27 members of the European Union, for the first time are being outproduced, outmanufactured and outexported, and also, interestingly, outinvested by the rest of the world, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the conference One of the key problems economists are now facing is the necessity to develop new, more efficient, ways of dealing with enormous financial deficits, particularly America s skyrocketing debt  The United States is paving the way with more than one trillion dollars of deficit each fiscal year, adding up to more than 14 trillion dollars in debt a problem which the US political leadership does seem to be eager to deal with  Robert Johnson, the executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, George Soros' think-tank, which is leading the conference, in his opening speech questioned the effectiveness of current financial governance and called for measures to restore trust in the system  At this time, I do not think people are trusting governments after financial bailouts  I do not think they trust experts by and large That s the nature of the problem, that s why INET was formed, he told RT However, Johnson says it is not so easy to come up with a recipe to regain the trust of people who feel betrayed by the billion-dollar bailouts around the world  I m particularly concerned about the United States, which is at the center of the world system  The middle class in the United States is feeling compressed  They are experiencing what you might call a social death, while two to three per cent are doing very, very well, he continued  Almost all of the gains from 1979 to the present, perhaps more than 100 per cent, have gone to the top one per cent, and that s just not sustainable, and that is not inspiring of trust  Commenting on the current situation with the dollar as the world's reserve currency, Johnson said that the prevailing view among delegates at the conference is that the dollar is diminishing in significance for various reasons: The dollar is diminishing in significance, somewhat for natural reasons, because the United States is the smaller proportion of the world economy, as the emerging countries, like Russia, Brazil, India and China, grow, he said At the same time, Johnson continued, the dollar may be suffering from the fact that leaders in the United States have not paid enough attention to strengthening the underlying economic conditions, such as infrastructure, education, scientific research and maintenance of demand  If you have a damaged and diminished population, damaged infrastructure and paltry or non-existent investment, you are not going to have a strong economy, and the dollar will be a reflection of that, Robert Johnson concluded  Gerald Epstein, Professor and Chair of Economics at the University of Massachussetts at Amherst, says emerging countries and financial regulators have much heavier responsibilities in the face of the global financial crisis  We need global cooperation to get us out of that current crisis, but also to help us to make a transition to a new type of economy where power is more widely dispersed around the world, he said, an economy that can deal with climate change and make the green transition that we need  Roman Frydman, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that the BRICS countries are accounting for an increasingly larger part of world consumption  US consumption, by some estimates, is expected to go down to as little as 20 percent, he said  And Europe will be another 20 percent  And the rest of the world will be about 60 percent  That s a major, major transformation  And all these countries will play a much bigger role   in the next couple decades  ",https://www.rt.com/news/george-soros-new-world/

"9 Sep, 2009", The wealthiest in America start to move their money out of the US ,"The U S  dollar-based post WWII phantasmagorical world of never having to pay your debts is coming to a close, states financial journalist Max Kaizer to RT  RT: You predict America is on the slippery slope to economic collapse  What do you think of America s national debt levels? Max Kaiser: The American debt levels are outrageous, and the way America gets away with it is by maintaining the world reserve currency as a big part of the American hegemony, or the American empire  When America writes checks or creates bonds to other countries, when those bonds are due, America just creates more bonds  It s what some call an extraordinary privilege  And this is why countries like Russia, China and Iran are looking to diverse [sic] themselves, and divorce themselves, from the US dollar  They re doing more deals amongst themselves, more bilateral deals in their local currencies, their regional currencies  Ultimately, America is a debt-a-holic  RT: What will the consequences of America s national debt be? MK: I think it s in the works right now, some kind of a gold bullion backed currency, and the implications for the US are not great, because they have this huge debt, so they will be forced to trade off their debt not by just inflating themselves out of the problem by creating more paper  If the rest of the world becomes more competitive, and the rest of the world starts adopting real sound currencies, the US would also be forced to be competitive to some degree, greater than they currently are  And in a real, fair, competitive race, the US has the weakest currency  If the global economic and business game is a game of poker, the US is holding a terrible hand  RT: What do you think about the Federal Reserve getting more powers from the Obama administration when many blame Fed for the crisis? MK: To use the alcoholic metaphor, it s like giving an alcoholic more to drink  Hank Paulson and his successor Timothy Geithner are part of the financial oligarchy, a part of the banking oligarchy, their interests are not the same as the interests of American citizens; they have their own interests  They are part of a global banking cartel, the same group of bankers all over the world, who seek to keep interest rates as low as possible, to make it as easy for them to borrow as possible  Because when they make a bad bet, their respective governments bail them out with tax payer money  It s really a war, there s a global war going on between investors and speculators  Anyone who s trying to invest money for a decent return, or work for a decent wage is being squeezed out or pushed out by speculators who have access to cheap money through political connections  RT: Do you believe the American bailout is a form of protectionism? MK: It s not free market capitalism, it s an industrial policy; it is a policy of the government wanting to get into every nook and cranny of the business sector, because the people who are in politics and in business want the cheapest possible access to money  They do not want to compete, and the easiest way not to compete is to do business with the government, who has the ability to raise taxes, to confiscate wealth, to wage wars  So, it s not a coincidence that the primary GDP-boosting activities of America are war, which services the war councils that are on the board of directors of these banks and in Washington, and cheap consumerism, consuming foreign-made goods, slave-made goods in other countries  And again, with the US, it is great if you have a world reserve currency and everyone needs to buy US dollars to conduct their business  This is why countries like Russia, China, Iran and Brazil are trying to divorce themselves away from the US because it is completely toxic currency  It supports an empire that is too lazy to compete, that makes money through cheap consumption and war  The rest of the world is saying: We want to move away from that model  We want to do something more vibrant, more capitalistic and more dynamic RT: What is going to happen to this shadow banking system if it keeps on going unchecked? MK: What will happen? There is going to be a currency re-valuation across the globe  The dollar would probably be cut in half versus made of the trading currencies  Gold in particular will have to be, as it was in the 30s, valued upward  Gold and precious metals and any currency that brings in to the basket of commodities or precious metals as the basis of the currency will in concert I believe move 50-60% in one day or one week or may move over 100% in a week  This means that all the currencies will be revalued against gold  And the currency which will lose the most would be the US dollar  So for people like in America, as it happened in other countries   like Iceland recently, or other bail-out countries from the IMF, or in Russia, or in the UK in the 70s   suddenly people wake up and the currency is devalued by 50%  Everything at the store costs double or triple or quadruple and there is nothing they can do about it  Because it s not like these things happening according to a carefully coordinated plan by the banking establishment around the world that is setting this all up to go  It is going to be practically effortless on their part  I was impressed how Europe embraced the Euro  The logistics of converting all these currencies to the Euro was a pretty amazing job  So think about this new currency grade happening very quickly in all the currencies had a new relative value versus commodities  Of course the US won t be happy about that but most of the major wealth in the US will be outside of the US by then  RT: You say that people are pulling money out of America  Do you have any data to spot this? MK: The data as you see is in the price of gold bullion for one thing, but all this talk about deflation and GDP is contracting and the economics are slowing down  You still have the price of gold doing very well  You also see the currencies outside the US start to break way from the US dollar  And they are doing pretty well, currencies like New Zealand and Australia start to come back in a huge way  They start to outperform the US right now  The US is standing back a bit, but there are some countries which are doing much better  The Russian Stock market is doing fantastically well  They ve got resources, good infrastructure, great relationships with China, Iran, Brazil and some other countries  They are positioning themselves as hot assets The US dollar-based post WWII, IMF, World Bank a phantasmagorical world of never having to pay your debts is coming to a close  And ones it happens you want to be on the right side of that trade  RT: Are you prepared to stick out your neck and say by this date will be doomsday for America as you call it? MK: In the US the number that I would look at is the unemployment number, it is continuing to creep up, the wage number is continuing to go down on an hourly basis and even if you want to play with the numbers on employment and unemployment and there s a lot of ways that these statistics are cooked and arranged, the basic hourly wage number is continuing to deteriorate, so at some point there will be a critical mass of unemployed people in America who will then I think spontaneously, as it happens in other countries, will suddenly have to decide that this is it, that we can t take it anymore  The honeymoon of Barack Obama seems to be entering a new phase where people are less excited by his program of change because they do not see any change in the banking system and the bankers are still very much pilfering and very much stealing and they want more power  So its tough to say exactly when that spark will hit that ignites the Hindenburg of social unrest in the US but I do not think that at this point you can reverse it, there s nothing that can be done to reverse this inevitable collision and I think that also one of the amazing stories of 9/11 is how, when the 9/11 disaster hit, is really the beginning when the wealthiest in America start to move their money out of the US  That was what they learnt that the US isn t really safe for my money anymore and they started to move their money out of US aggressively since 9/11 a lot of the complications and the reason why Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates down to 1 percent after 9/11 was in a large part to assist the wealthiest of America in moving all their capital out of America  RT: Tell us more about the KarmaBanque that you've created  MK: KarmaBanque is like what if Gandhi and George Soros had a love child, basically  What I did was I figured out which companies, if a large boycott were enacted, would have the greatest impact on their share price, which companies market capitalization is most weighted toward a consumer boycott that would cause major damage  So a company like Exxon is not particularly vulnerable to consumer boycott, cause they re diversified in many ways, their stock doesn t trade in the high multiple of retail sales  But a company like Coca-Cola is very vulnerable to boycott  The second turbo-charged aspect to the KarmaBanque methodology, is that if people decide that they re going to boycott a product like a Coca-Cola, it will have an effect on their revenues and profits  In America, they re used to the idea of if I like the company, I ll buy the stock  So this is just the opposite: I don t like the company, I m going to boycott the stock to the point where hedge funds start selling short that stock  RT: Some people call you a financial terrorist  How do you respond to that? MK: That would be incorrect  What I am suggesting cannot be considered financial terrorism  It can be considered economics  Because what I m saying is that a lot of these companies have unrealized risk that s not reflected in their own balance sheet which is descent risk  I m making that risk visible, and by making this risk visible and quantifying it should be reflected in the stocks price  Hedge funds and other big institutions like pension funds looking for ways to increase returns to help those people who benefit from their accounts in these large institutes will benefit from this approach ",https://www.rt.com/usa/wealthiest-america-start-move/
"24 Jun, 2009",How Western media backs the green revolution in Iran,"It was an election that was snatched from the Iranian people or at least that's the impression being given by Western media outlets  But are they telling the full story? The BBC and the Voice of America radio station have been harshly criticized by Iranian officials who accuse the broadcasters of fueling violence after the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  The European Union has rejected Iran s accusations that the Western media helped engineer post-election unrest as protests in Tehran continue  And US President Barack Obama has also said that Washington is not interfering in Iran's affairs  While strongly condemning the actions of Tehran in curbing the protests, Obama said the United States respects the sovereignty of the country  But Iranians screaming about fraud and demanding a fair election that s what most people are seeing on their TV screens  Journalist Jalal Ghazi believes Ahmadinejad won the elections because the difference is 11 million and you just cannot expect 11 million votes to be forged  So why does the American media seem to overlook that fact? As the protests continue, some experts still believe there is interference from outside of Iran  A columnist and a former assistant secretary of the US Treasury in the Reagan administration, Paul Craig Roberts, says it's all part of a major destabilization plan ordered by the US  The CIA has been conducting a destabilization plan within Iran for the last two years; it is well known and has been widely reported in American and British press  We are seeing the fruits of an orchestrated protest that is taking place in Tehran, said Roberts  The American media serves as a propaganda ministry for the government, he added  Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen told RT that the real story behind the media in Iran is that of instigating a green revolution  George Bush funneled $400 million to George Soros Open Society Institute and National Endowment for Democracy (NED) institutions to influence this opposition movement against the Iranian government, Madsen claims  Every time you hear about revolutions it is George Soros and the Open Society Institute  Going further, Madsen argued that Yesterday, CNN really had trouble with priming itself away from the coverage of demonstration in Tehran to cover a terrible metro train accident in Washington  What is the motivation for all this intense coverage by CNN, MSNBC and Fox News? It seems like there is a coordinated and concerted effort to stir things up using Western media  Experts are questioning whether or not this may be another US attempt to foment a color revolution in the Middle East, as it has done in past years in Eastern Europe  There is a tendency now to take advantage of what is an internal problem with the present Iranian government, Wayne Madsen said  We see some of the same hallmarks today in Tehran which we saw in Ukraine and Georgia  Read alsoThe West does not conceal its intention to hold another color revolution in Iran ",https://www.rt.com/russia/how-western-media-backs-the-green-revolution-in-iran/

prosecutors to bring conspiracy charges against Bernard Madoff, the mega-billion dollar Ponzi scammer who pleaded guilty March 12 to eleven counts of fraud and other crimes in U S  District Court in Manhattan, is providing cover to those who pulled the strings on Madoff's illegal operation  WMR spoke to a former close aide to Madoff who related how he handled a number of transactions personally

secretive banking operations in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland  Madoff would also dispatch messengers to 55 Water Street in New York's financial district to pick up securities bearer bonds that could fit into an ""Army duffle bag "" Those types of transactions dramatically decreased for Madoff after 9/11  The weekend following the Fourth of July, Madoff would sponsor a three-day bash for Madoff employees and ""special guests"" at Montauk on the eastern tip of Long Island  One of Madoff's special guests was Norman F  Levy, a billionaire who Madoff considered as a father figure  After his death, Levy's old firm continued to maintain an office at 885 Third Avenue in Manhattan, the same location as Madoff's firm  A Madoff insider speculated that Madoff may have been using Levy's company as a conduit for his business activities  The annual Montauk conclave featured a dinner for Madoff's ""special guests"" on the Saturday evening at the Montauk Yacht Club  Madoff's ""special guests"" were kept segregated from the regular Madoff employees  The special guests were often found in a special place called the ""money fund room "" In addition to Madoff's immediate family members, including his brother Peter, he also tended to surround himself with key individuals who were veteran officers of the U S  military  Madoff's London operation was handled out of a one-room small office located at 43 Newell Street  Every time Madoff visited the office, the London staff was extremely nervous  According to a Madoff insider, the Madoff London office was nothing more than a ""front"" operation  There may have also been some synergy between Madoff's London operations and American International Group (AIG), which reportedly is missing $500 billion from a similar small office pass-through operation in London  Madoff's number one foreign destination was not England but France, where he maintained a luxurious estate in Provence  Madoff routinely got his cash from the Bank of New York (BONY) and Chase  One favorite Bernie Madoff term was an ""inch of fifties,"" which equates to $5,000  The day before Madoff was arrested, he sent a ""package"" to Citibank's private banking facility at 850 Lexington Avenue  Usually when Madoff Securities sent out a ""package,"" a set of documents in an 8 1/2 x 11 inch envelope authorizing electronic funds transfers, there was always a signed receipt from Citibank  One exception was ""packages"" personally sent by Madoff to Citibank  On December 10, Madoff sent a ""package"" to Citibank with no receipt from the private banking service  That evening Madoff attended the company's annual Christmas party, which had always been held on December 17  Madoff was reportedly not acting normal and his wife Ruth was trying to play the gregarious role normally handled by Madoff in previous parties  WMR's inside source believes that Madoff knew then that he was facing arrest the next day  WMR has also learned that Madoff Securities was for sale in the late 1990s  One of the names mentioned in the potential sale is Ezra Merkin, also under investigation by the federal government's probe of Wall Street  WMR has learned that Madoff almost sold his firm for $1 billion  The potential purchaser, who was not identified, flipped a coin between buying Madoff or Charles Schwab  The purchaser opted for a potential purchase of Schwab  Madoff often had a tense relationship with his family associates  In the mid-1990s, WMR was told of a particularly nasty exchange between Bernie and his brother Peter  Bernie allegedly told his brother,""When you see your name on the door, you can tell me what to do  Until then you have one percent of the stock so you can keep your fucking mouth shut "" When Peter's son Roger died of cancer at the age of 30, a cancer fund was established in Roger's name  Our source said that the fund for Bernie Madoff's late nephew was also defrauded  The source said,""Bernie would never do that to his nephew,""adding,""Bernie was operating a ""pump and dump"" scheme for a domestic and foreign intelligence agency ""Asked to name the domestic agency, the source replied,""CIA ""Asked about the foreign agency, the source claimed it was""the Russia-Israeli mob operating with Mossad ""It is also reported that a number of key Madoff employees died suddenly from various causes, including what was described as ""fast-acting cancer "" The cancer victims included Madoff's 55-year old in-house lawyer and his ""mid-fifties"" computer software engineer  The woman who created Madoff's over-the-counter stock trading system was struck and killed by a bus while walking to Bloomingdale's in Manhattan  One long-time Madoff employee told WMR that Bernie Madoff's father, Ralph Madoff, who worked as a New York plumber, once told the employee,""Never, never invest in Wall Street cause it's run by crooks and SOBs ""Ralph Madoff told the employee to take his money and ""buy books "" In Bernie Madoff's case, the apple fell extremely far from the tree  As a postscript, someone who worked with Madoff told WMR that he does not expect his old boss to live until his sentencing in June  The ex-employee believes that Madoff will not physically survive prison for very long  Given Madoff's extensive and murky intelligence links, there is every reason to believe the ex-employee is making the correct prediction  More on Madoff operation emerges from insiders   WMR has been informed by former Madoff Investment Securities sources that jailed Ponzi scammer Bernard Madoff's wife Ruth revealed as early as September 2008 that her husband was ""under great stress "" However, the source also revealed that Mr  Madoff ""thrived under great stress "" FBI investigators reportedly asked Madoff employees, after Madoff's arrest on December 11, 2008, whether Madoff had been ""acting strange"" before the arrest  Employees were also asked to provide the FBI with a psychological profile of Madoff  A Madoff Investment Securities insider told WMR,""Bernie's mission was to keep the company he created alive with infusions from strangers  They turned out to suffer collateral damage ""The source added,""Bernie could not give customers bad news "" Madoff insiders also described how the Ponzi scammer formed his company in 1961  Madoff began his firm with a mere $5,000 in capital  Madoff was not able to gain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because of the prohibitive cost of $250,000  Bypassing the NYSE, Madoff developed over-the-counter (OTC) trades and ""back doored"" trading into the NYSE  Madoff first used card punch machines in the OTC process, progressed to magnetic tape computers, and then employed newer, state-of-the-art technology  WMR also learned that the computer systems engineer for Madoff who developed Madoff Investment Securities computerized trading system used proprietary software and, more oddly, proprietary hardware  In 1999, Madoff initiated the development of a top secret new trading system called Primex, which attracted the interest of NASDAQ, where Bernard Madoff served as chairman and his brother Peter had previously served as a board member  The computer engineer died a few years ago in her mid-fifties of what was described by a colleague as a ""fast-acting"" cancer  WMR learned that Madoff was somewhat incensed about the high cost of gaining a seat on the NYSE  Actor Rick Jason, who co-starred with Vic Morrow in the TV series ""Combat,"" actually had a seat on the NYSE that was bought for him by Jason's father  That made Madoff all the more determined to bypass the expensive NYSE seat requirement to carry out trades  Jason reportedly shot himself to death on October 16, 2000  When Madoff was considering selling his firm to an unnamed suitor in the late 1990s, WMR was told by a firm insider that one reason Madoff was hesitant to sell was that even during that time frame he was concerned that if his company's books came under scrutiny from a sale that the company would ""crash "" WMR also learned that a close associate of one of Madoff's top corporate officers was involved in trying to obtain a U S  State Department contract for Halliburton, the firm once headed by former Vice President Dick Cheney  The individual in question reportedly was working with Halliburton's office in Baghdad, Iraq  A Madoff firm source also revealed to WMR that American International Group's (AIG) London office, which reportedly lost some $500 billion, was engaged in an ""economic warfare"" scheme against countries of the former Soviet Union  The operations coincided with the funding by George Soros of various campaigns to oust governments in Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and even Russia itself  WMR also learned additional details of events that transpired the day before Madoff was arrested, December 10, 2008  Madoff unusually switched his firm's annual Christmas Party from its normal December 17 date to December 10  Not only was that seen as unusual by Madoff employees but so, too, was the fact that Madoff's two sons, Andrew, who ran a spin-off called Madoff Energy, and Mark, were not present at the party  Earlier in the day, both had reportedly spoken to FBI agents about their father's Ponzi scheme activities
