"6 Jan, 2021 12:48","As Lockdown 3.0 descends on Britain, the time for reason and argument is over. Only dissent will save us now","The restrictions placed on us by authoritarian governments aren't driven by logic, but the emotion of phrases like ‘Don’t kill Granny.’ I prefer Albert Einstein's words: ‘A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.’ ByPeter Andrews, Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics Here we are again. After what was for many people a fraught and upsetting Christmas, and a revelry-free New Year, the UK is back in lockdown. It is slated to last until February, but without major dissent, the true end is not in sight. Is Lockdown 3.0 ‘justified’? Is the NHS ‘about to be overwhelmed’? Will the big bad new strain come and get me? If you are still asking these questions at this point you may be beyond reach. Plenty of better minds than mine have for ten months tirelessly and repeatedly madewatertight argumentsthat lockdowns do incalculable harm and just about zero good. The situation in the NHS is not markedly different to just about every previous winter going back as long as you like — justGoogleit. And the ‘new’ strain is transparentpropaganda. Sadly though, there is a problem with my arguments: they are based on nothing except reason and rationality.  I refuse to once again become bogged down in discussions of cases, infection rates, ICU beds and the rest of the flotsam and jetsam of this debate. In constantly reacting to the government’s latest claims, we forge the weapons of our own defeat. In any case, there is really only one statistic that matters when you are assessing the impact of a pandemic: overall excess deaths. That is, the number of people dying of ALL CAUSES compared with previous years. As this latestbriefingfrom Dr Malcolm Kendrick shows, there have not been significant overall excess deaths this winter in the UK. Nor has there been in any other country he assesses. In fact, nowhere in the world have I seen evidence of excess deaths outside of the range of what’s happened before in bad influenza years, notwithstanding the first and much more serious Covid spike in spring. Dr Kendrick has been one of the finest and sanest scientific voices of this debacle, and he has now devoted almost a year of his life to fighting the good fight through his brilliant research and writing. I do not know him personally, but I hope he will not take it the wrong way when I say that he has failed. All of his stellar work, although it has provided discursive ammunition and intellectual vindication to many of us, has not served to hold back the tide of authoritarianism sweeping the world. The reason why he, and the rest of us trying to hold back the tide, have failed, is because we have not appealed enough to emotion. Thisfascinatingexchangeon the excellent Lockdown Sceptics website gets at the heart of the matter. Our doomed strategy was to appeal to logic, reason and rationality, while the establishment took the more effective approach of cynically targeting human emotion. They cry, ‘Don’t kill granny’, sums up why we have lost this battle. Our enemies’ argument, having nothing to do with science or logic, can be boiled down to this simple emotional trigger. Wear a mask so you won’t kill granny. Do as you’re told so you won’t kill granny. I still hear people of all ages citing that cliched slogan today. We have stuck to the rules, while our enemies have flouted them at every turn. They have demonstrated time and time again that they have not the slightest interest in having a proper, informed discussion about this issue, the biggest catastrophe of our time. But enough is enough. It is time to draw a line in the sand and refuse to comply with their diktats any longer.  If you are still sitting on the fence about this, I don’t blame you. Never before has my generation (I am in my mid 20s) been called upon to serve something larger than themselves. But if nothing else motivates you, just consider the next year of your life. The mainstream media won’t address this, but exactly how long do you think it is going to take to vaccinate most of the population? The wildest optimists say that it will take most of this year, and that is if a state-of-the-art programme to vaccinate millions each week materialises presently. Do you honestly believe that there is a snowball’s chance in hell of that happening? And we have it from thehorse’s mouththat this ‘new normal’ is here to stay until most people are vaccinated. Do you believe that Matt Hancock, Boris Johnson, SAGE and the rest mean it when they assure us of this? I do. These people have no intention of releasing you from under their thumb. The feeling titillates them far too much, and they are now fully in the throes of an ecstatic power trip. All of this being the case, it is time for each individual freedom-loving person to have a quiet conversation with themselves, and to remember the words of one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Benjamin Franklin: “It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority”. Or those of the former US Senator J. William Fulbright, “In a democracy, dissent is an act of faith”. Ask yourself how much more of your remaining days on this earth you are willing to hand over to these authoritarians. Ask yourself where your personal line in the sand is, and what it would take for you to say ‘no more’. And finally, ask yourself what you will be willing to do, what lengths you will be ready to go to, when the time for action comes. Because as sure as Boris Johnson tells porkies, it will come.

"5 Jan, 2021 12:59","Slavoj Zizek: We’re at a grim crossroads in this pandemic: one path leads to utter despair, the other to total extinction","A quote from Woody Allen, from back in 1979, is now an apt if disturbing description of mankind’s predicament with Covid. We have a stark choice to make if we are to survive and construct a new society. is a cultural philosopher. He’s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. is a cultural philosopher. He’s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. We read again and again in our media that we are at the “beginning of the end” of the pandemic: although numbers of infections and deaths are still rising, millions are already vaccinated, so there is now at least the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. In spite of worries about how we will survive the next few months, there are signs of relief. We deserve this relaxation since what was so depressive about the pandemic was precisely that there was no clear exit in sight – the feeling of the end of the world dragged on without end. Now it looks like the nightmare will be over soon, we will try to obliterate it from our memory and return to normal life as soon as possible. Some intellectuals bent on finding a deeper meaning in every catastrophe even evoke these famous lines from Friedrich Hölderlin’s hymn ‘Patmos’, “Wo aber Gefahr ist, wächst das Rettende auch” (“Where the danger is, that which saves is also growing”), as relevant for our predicament. In what precisely resides this relevance? Is it simply that science saved us by inventing vaccines in a record time? Is it that the pandemic reminded us of our mortality and vulnerability, and thus cured us of our arrogance, teaching us we are part of nature, not its masters? However, it would be much more appropriate to turn around Hölderlin’s verses: “But where that which saves us is growing, there are dangers also.” And these dangers are multiple. Let’s begin with the World Health Organization experts’warningthat, though the effects of the pandemic have been very severe, it is ‘not necessarily the big one’, and the world will have to learn to live with Covid-19. Not only is the Covid pandemic far from over, given numbers are still rising, but new pandemics are on the horizon; global warming, fires, and droughts are ruining our environment; the economic effects of the pandemic will strike later in 2021 giving a new boost to social protests; digital control of our lives will remain; mental health problems will explode… and we will have to learn to live not just with Covid-19, but with all this medley of interconnected phenomena. This is why we are now going through the most dangerous moment of the entire pandemic. To relax now would be like falling asleep behind the wheel of a car moving fast on a winding road. We have to make lots of decisions that cannot all be grounded in science – our moment is now the moment of radical political choices. True, science may save us. Greta Thunberg was right that we should trust it, but in a true scientific spirit, we should also admit two thingsnotedby Juergen Habermas: we didn’t just learn new things, we also got to know how many things we didn’t know, plus we were forced to act in an impenetrable situation without knowing what the effects of our acts would be. This not-knowing does not concern only the pandemic itself – we at least have experts there – but even more its economic, social, and psychic consequences. It is not simply that we don’t know what is going on, but that we know we don’t know, and this not-knowing is itself a social fact, and it is inscribed into how our institutions act. We should take even a step further here: it is not just that we know more and more what we don’t know, it sometimes appears as if reality itself acts as if it forgot its own laws. We know the joke about ‘knowledge in the real’ – that a stone knows the law it must obey when it’s falling down. But the basic lesson of quantum physics is that nature itself doesn’t know all its laws, and this is why Albert Einstein reacted with such anxiety to quantum physics and its basic premise of the indeterminacy of nature – for Einstein, this simply meant that quantum physics is an incomplete theory that ignores some unknown variables. There is a supreme irony in the fact that, although both Einstein and physicist Niels Bohr were atheists, their most famous exchange is about God: Einstein remarked, “God does not play dice,” and Bohr snapped back, “Stop telling God what to do.” Their disagreement was not about God, but about the nature of our universe: Einstein couldn’t accept that nature itself is in some sense “incomplete”. The pandemic seems to be signaling that Bohr was right. This indeterminacy, which reaches all the way down to subatomic level, opens up the space for our interventions, but only if we fully assume it – that is, if we reject determinism in both its main versions: naturalism and divine providence. A Slovene theologian who advocates keeping churches open in spite of quarantine regulations answered the reproach that many lives would be lost in a simple and straight way: “The mission of the Church is not health but salvation.” In short, the death and suffering of thousands doesn’t matter with regard to their salvation in eternity through God. This is what Mother Theresa was doing in Kolkata: hermissionwas to take care of “the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone” – but, ascriticshave demonstrated, more than their health, she took care of their salvation and deathbed conversion to Catholicism. So, we can easily imagine what she would have been doing now when the pandemic is ravaging the world: no vaccination, not even respirators, but just spiritual solace in a grey environment for the last hours of our life. And we can also imagine what will happen in the near future if the pandemic explodes even more, through new mutations of the virus, and renders vaccines inefficient: people will be dying in even bigger numbers than from the Spanish flu and, lacking any vision of how to contain the pandemic, our authorities will resign themselves to just providing care for the dying, inclusive of pills for a painless death, while the Church will offer mass conversions to diminish depression with the promise of salvation for the faithful. Our ultimate choice is thus best encapsulated by the beginning of a textwritten by Woody Allenback in 1979: “More than any other time in history, mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.” The correct choice is the decision to assume the despair and utter hopelessness of our predicament: only if we pass through this zero-point we will be able to construct a new society-to-come. The wrong step may lead us to a new divided society with the privileged living in isolated bubbles while the majority vegetates in barbaric conditions. Today, more than ever, egalitarianism is not just a vague ideal, but an urgent necessity: vaccines for all, universal healthcare, a global struggle against global warming… Here is a small unexpected sign in this direction: Uğur Şahin, BioNTech’s CEO, a Turk living in Germany who played a key role in inventing the best vaccine, said in aninterviewat the end of 2020: “At the moment, it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine” – a wonderful moment when the CEO of a company wants the competitors to get stronger because he knows that only all together can they win the struggle against the pandemic. So, maybe the proper way to conclude is to repeat the well-known warning that is sometimes added to the idea of the light at the end of the tunnel: let’s make sure that this light is not that of another train rushing towards us from the other side.

"18 Dec, 2020 07:09",God does play dice – physicist,"What is life? Despite the best efforts of scientists, this fundamental question is still a conundrum. Professor Paul Davies, physicist, astrobiologist, cosmologist and best-selling author has his own formula for tracing the answer. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Professor Paul Davies, physicist, astrobiologist, cosmologist, best-selling author, really great to have you with us today. So much to talk about, especially information because I'm a journalist and I work with information a lot. Now you're interested in this concept of organised information. For me as a journalist, information is more abstract of a concept than mathematicians think of it as like bits and binary codes and stuff. Without making it too complicated for my audiences, сan you explain, what is information in physics? Paul Davies:Right, you're correct that we use that word in daily life and we have a sort of rough and ready idea of what information means. The best definition is that it reduces uncertainty. So for example, if you're going to go in Moscow, to the metro, and you just go random, you might wait, I don't know, 10 minutes or something for a train to come along. But if you have a timetable, it reduces your uncertainty as to when the train will arrive. And that definition actually can be made very mathematically precise. About 70 years ago, what we now call ‘information theory’ was based on that notion of reduction in uncertainty. I’ll give another simple example: you toss a coin, did it come down heads or tails? I don't know if you use that expression in Russia, but one side or the other. And you don't know. But when you look , you get the definite information, you acquire one bit of information. So that's the technical definition. And so in using that we can apply it to biology, to the nature of life. And it was recognised a long time ago, when the famous double helix of the structure of DNA was worked out. The DNA stores the genetic information, it's the blueprint, if you like, of what makes you you and me – me. And that information has to be stored and processed, and read out, and managed, and manipulated. And so we all recognise that part of what makes living systems so important is that they can pass on or express that information and pass it from one generation to the next, while they express it by the DNA, making proteins or carrying out certain functions. So that's the basic idea about how all that came to exist in the first place, is still a very big mystery. SS:All right, so treating information as if it, not matter, was the stuff out of which the world is built, is one of the avenues in thought that you're pursuing, right? So what do you get as a scientist when you treat information this way? What kind of new understanding about the universe can you find if you accept hypothetically that information is the primal building block of our world? PD:You've raised a very interesting issue that we understand that as a practical matter, information is critical to the operation of biological systems. And there's a whole field called ‘bioinformatics’. And now you all know about gene editing, that we can treat DNA like the code book of life, and you can get in there and you can actually edit it and change some of the letters and some of the meaning and you can create your own life form. So this is current technology. So we all understand that. But you've asked a deeper question about whether somehow, information is the primary stuff out of which the universe is built. And the American physicist John Wheeler, who coined the term “black hole,” he was a great advocate of this idea that at the bottom of what we might call ‘the great chain of being’ is information, not matter. We think of atoms or electrons or something, we normally think they are the primary stuff, but he said, “No-no, information is the primary stuff, matter is simply a manifestation of various states of information.” And so he coined a wonderful term – “it from bit.” “It” might be an atom and the “bit” is the bit of information. And he felt that information is a primary source. Now that's still a minority view. But a number of my colleagues feel, “Yes, the universe is really a vast information processing network,” that  that is the ultimate reality. This thing we call “matter,” you can kick it, you can touch it, it seems solid, but that’s illusory. Deep down is all about information. SS:So, regarding that question of matter, there's an equation of yours that I came across: Life=Matter+Information. So that means Information=Life–Matter, right? Can information be interpreted as ‘soul’ out of this equation? PD:Well, ‘soul’ is a loaded term, of course, and it comes from a religious view of the world. So most scientists wouldn’t talk about soul as a separate thing, some fluffy thing that floats around alongside matter. But if by that, by the word ‘soul’, I would rather use the word ‘mind’, we think, how does the brain work? How do we have consciousness? So we've got this rather abstract thing called the ‘mind’, we have consciousness and we don't think of it as a substance, at least I don’t. But somehow, there's a matter story to tell, we have the brain, we have circuits in the brain, we  talk about electrons and signals going around in the brain. And then we've got this extraordinary phenomenon, called ‘consciousness’ and the two of them have to be fitted together. Now, I don't think we've done that yet. But I suppose your question is leading me in the direction to say, well, if information is primary, maybe we should think of mind as being primary and matter as being secondary. I'm carrying this a little bit far but that idea goes back into ancient history. It's called ‘idealism’. It goes back to ancient Greek philosophy that ultimately the world is built out of, as it were mind stuff, rather than matter stuff. That's a big stretch for modern physicists to go. But like many of these ancient ideas, there’s often a grain of truth in it. I think we're circling back to some of that ancient thinking. SS:But I still want to like ponder on that a little bit because you talk in your recent book  how it works in cells and atoms, but how can information be on the same level as matter? I mean, doesn't information only exist when there is something or someone to read it? Isn't information basically confined to the eye of the beholder? PD:Yes. You're absolutely right. And one of the founders of this whole fascinating area of information theory, in physics, Rolf Landauer, he famously said, ‘information is physical’. What he meant by that is that it doesn't sort of float free in the ether, it's always tied to matter. So, for example, I mentioned DNA, the position of nucleotides in DNA encodes the information in a biological organism. In a computer, it will be, you know, 1s and 0s stored in the hard drive or something like that. There's always a physical medium. But the same is true of energy. We talk about energy in an abstract sense, there's more of it or less of it, energy can be converted from one form to another and passed on between different systems. And the energy itself doesn't go away, make it spread out a bit . It's always somewhere in a physical system. But in a sense, it has a life of its own. So information is a bit like that. We can talk about it as if it has an independent existence and we do all the time. After all, Silicon Valley, in the United States, makes billions and billions of dollars by selling and manipulating information. And so, you know, it must, in some sense, be real. But it's always got to be instantiated in matter somehow, somewhere. But that doesn't mean that it can still be a primary concept. So information and matter go hand in hand, there's no doubt about it. SS:If we're assuming that information is the primal thing or at least as primal as the matter, assuming that information is the foundation of the universe, isn't it kind of like saying that map of a town is the town? PD:Yes. When does the map become the territory? If it's a 1:1 map, mathematicians will tell you then that the map is the territory. And I think what we're discussing here, and maybe we're hung up on this point, it's a little bit like the dichotomy between hardware and software in computing. We understand that a computer will only work if it's loaded with the appropriate software. And I often draw the analogy here with life. Life seems to me like magic but so does this computer. I'm talking to you on this computer. It looks like it's magic. How does it work? Well, if you went to a computer science department, and you went in and they pulled the back off, and they said, ‘well, if you look in here, there's silicon here and there's bits of copper and some other components and plastic’, and we're not completely sure how, how it all goes together but we're beginning to understand that what you’ve known that that was wrong, that you have to go to a computing department and they'll tell you all about the software, all about the code that's been written and uploaded into the machine and so on, you need both. But the software can't run without the hardware. But the computer is more than the hardware. And so you can argue, well, does the software have independent existence? Well, sure, in a sense, it does. Because I can copy it, I can put it on a memory stick, I can send it down an optical fiber, it's still there, it's like a pattern. So like patterns, you know, patterns exist in nature, but they always exist in something. They're instantiated in something. And so I think that's really what we're dealing with here. When it comes to biology, we have to go beyond just saying, well, there's a path, because we know that information has a more active or supervisory role in living things. So just think of the development of the embryo. It's not just a matter of information being read out. Everything has to be done – choreography has to be done in great detail. It's like a Bolshoi ballet unfolding, in the development of the embryo. So there's more to it than just counting bits of information. And I don't think we understand that more. There are laws that operate in living matter, involving information that we’re only glimpsing, we haven't yet completely worked them out. There's new physics in living better, I believe. So did Erwin Schroedinger, who started thinking about this way back in the 1940s. SS:Paul, how is information connected to life in your eyes? I mean, I heard you say that living beings are information processing systems. This could sound too simple, but if we can for a moment accept that, is this what we are for – to process information, kind of like what we make computers for? PD:Well, some cynics will say, yes, that your body is just a vehicle for mapping one lot of information into another lot of information. And so that's one way of looking at it. Stopped from havingto think about the nature of information in biology, so we've discussed already the example everybody knows, which is the information in DNA, which is copied, passed on to the next generation, it's expressed in the development of the embryo in a very complicated way. But it doesn't stop there because a cell – we all know we have genes and these genes can be switched on or off. But they don't act in isolation, they form complex networks, and information swirls around these networks. You can map it, people do. Biologists figure out what genes switch others on and they draw these network diagrams, like wiring diagrams in computation. And so there's a lot of information processing in those networks, and then cells signal each other, they are signaling molecules that send information from one to the other. There's great information processing system up here, between our ears. Everybody knows about that. And it doesn't stop, it goes right up that through ecosystems, right up to a planetary scale. And I think we're all these days obsessed by viruses and COVID-19. But you know, viruses are a central part of the planetary system, the planetary ecosystem, viruses get everywhere, they're like mobile, genetic elements or little bits of information that are passed around, and are essential for the health of the planet. And so I like to say that the planetary ecosystem, that life is the original World Wide Web. It's a web of information that extends to a planetary scale. So it's everywhere in life. But we understand only the bottom level of this information. I'm sure there are laws, I don't think these are miracles. I don't believe in anything like that. But I think we don't yet fully have that physics worked out. So that's the next great frontier. We have any young people, and I hope we do, watching us today, listening to this conversation that I would say, if I was going to make a career in science again, be  that intersection of physics and chemistry, and information theory, and biology, and computing. That's where the big discoveries will be made in the coming decades. SS:So in one interview, you described life as a complexity that cannot be achieved through fixed rules. And there's a famous quote by Einstein, ‘God doesn't play dice’, meaning that there's got to be underlying laws for what seems random at the moment. Are you actually saying that God indeed plays dice if the rules of nature are not fixed, but flexible? PD:Well, using Einstein's language, I am indeed saying, God does play dice. He was very much in a minority at the time. And experiments in foundations of quantum mechanics over the last few decades have really left no doubt that nature is intrinsically uncertain or indeterministic. So what Einstein meant by ‘God does not play dice’, he recognised that at the atomic level, things look sort of pretty random and chancy, but he thought that beneath that was a hidden layer of deterministic order, where everything that happened, happened for a very particular reason, that in principle, you could predict exactly what an atom would do, if you had that level of detail. We now know that that is not correct, that experiments have refuted that. So there is something intrinsically, indeterministic or chancy or open, if you like, it’s the term I’ve used, about systems on the atomic and molecular level. So quantum physics introduces that, absolutely, and quantum physics is essential to understanding life. But how these things fit together, how the uncertainty of quantum mechanics might fit together with the information processing that living organisms can carry out at a somewhat higher level, we don't know. But this is an area of active research at the moment. And so somewhere in that mix is the secret of life. And I come back to Erwin Schroedinger, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, who, in 1943, in Dublin, Ireland, gave his famous lectures with the title ‘What Is Life?’ and then wrote a book about that. And he recognised that quantum mechanics was essential for understanding the stability of the information content of cells. But he also left open the idea that there may be a new kind of physical law, operating in living matter. He didn't say what and he wasn't definite about it, but he was open to that idea. I think he was right. I think it is a new kind of physical law operating in living matter. It doesn't contradict the underlying laws, that's for sure, but it transcends, it’s in addition to them, because living systems are open systems. You can have both. SS:One of your biggest ambitions, as far as I understand, is to find extraterrestrial life. And you say one of the reasons why we still haven't found it is because we don't really know how life on Earth first started. How is knowing how life on Earth started going to affect our research on alien life? PD:Well, when I was a student, that was a long time ago, I’m a lot older than you, I was a passionate believer in life beyond Earth, and everybody told that it was crazy looking for aliens, people said that you might as well look for fairies, it's obvious that life is so complex, that it can surely have happened only once, the idea being that there was some sort of amazing chain of chemical reactions, leading to this very extraordinary, improbable thing we call life on Earth. But during my career, the pendulum has swung the other way. And now, many, many scientists say, ‘Oh, the universe is teeming with life, wherever you have Earth-like planets, it is a good chance life would emerge. But the truth is we absolutely don't know because the big step is how do you go from non-life to life? Is that something that is going to happen fairly easily, inevitably? Wait a few million years and it will happen? Or is it the case that it's like a freak, a sequence of chemical reactions, which put together are extremely improbable and may happen only once in the universe? And we don't know how to answer that because nobody's made life in the lab. We're a long way from understanding how chemistry turns into life, how the molecules organise themselves into something, even a primitive living thing. The gulf is huge between a mishmash of chemicals and even the simplest living thing. So we don't know, we don't know what numbers to put in there. And so if we don't know that number, we can't estimate how many inhabited planets are. We know that in the Milky Way galaxy, there are billions probably of Earth-like planets, of which life, as we know, it could emerge, at least if we took it there, it could survive. So we know there are plenty of candidates. But we don't know the chances that on those planets, chemical mixtures will turn into life. It could be that such an improbable thing, such amazing unlikely step, that it won't have happened anywhere else in the galaxy. Or it could be that if I'm right about these deep principles in operating and living matter, there are laws of life in living matter, but if we knew those laws of life, we might be able to say, ‘Oh, yes, those laws will operate to turn chemistry into life with 50% probability or 30% probability’, then we can put a number to it. At the moment, we don't have those laws, and we have no evidence whatever for life beyond Earth. So this is complete speculation, your beliefs, my beliefs are as good as each other’. SS:So if we connect life to information in a meaningful way, does that mean that alien life could just be some form of information that is not related to having cells or certain chemical elements? Like could it be, as Douglas Adams suggested, ‘a particular shade of blue’, for instance? PD:It’s a very good question and it goes to the heart of what we're trying to achieve in our research in the Arizona State University because everybody knows it’s a field of astrobiology, it means, going to look for life beyond Earth. But of course, you have to know what to look for. And we know what terrestrial life is like. But what we would like really is to have some sort of more general definition of what is life. And that definition, in my view, is based on the software, not the hardware, it doesn’t matter the stuff of which a living organism is made, it's the way that information is organised and processed. So if it's the case, that life, if we can define life as a particular type of information or pattern or organisation, it's organised information, not as any organization… but let’s give it a very specific definition, it has to be organised in a certain way. Then, for my money, we would go look for that informational signature, the software signature, if you like, instead of the hardware signature. So instead of concentrating on does this or that planet have the right sort of molecules, we will be more thinking about does it have the right conditions to allow information processing to take place in the manner that we think represents life. This is all wishful thinking at the moment, we don't have a fully worked out definition of life, which is independent of the stuff of which it’s made. But at the end of the day, that's what it will be about. If life beyond Earth exists it won't be a replica of our life. There will be some common principles and those principles, I think, are software rather than hardware. Just like you have different makes of computers and they're all made of, you know, with silicon chips or germanium or something and plastic and copper wires, they're all made of the same sort of stuff, but what gives individual computers a distinctive brand is the software and that software, just like the hardware has some deep principles, it all flows from certain basic ideas of coding, and so forth. The same is true of life, I'm sure. SS:Well, Paul, it was such a pleasure talking to you, a true delight. And I hope we get to do this again because the subject is endless and there's so many unanswered questions still. Thanks a lot for this chat and good luck with everything. Stay safe. PD:Thank you. I really enjoyed talking to you and I hope we can talk again. SS:Thank you. Absolutely. Bye! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"10 Dec, 2020 14:25",Hong Kong protest hero Joshua Wong trained alongside the cream of Western-backed colour revolutionaries,"On 2 December, high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong was sentenced to over a year in prison for his involvement in an unauthorised protest outside the territory’s police headquarters in June 2019. ByKit Klarenberg, an investigative journalist exploring the role of intelligence services in shaping politics and perceptions. Follow Kit on Twitter@KitKlarenberg It marks the third time the 24-year-old has been jailed for his political activities, and follows an amazingly rapid ascent to international prominence, which began in 2014, when the group he founded, Scholarism, played a pivotal role in the Occupy Central protests that year. Wong was subsequently listed among Time magazine’s Most Influential Teens of 2014 and nominated as its Person of the Year, declared one of the “world’s greatest leaders” by Fortune the following year, and even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017. He somehow also found time to establish and lead pro-democracy political party Demosisto – which called for “self-determination” from China – until its disbandment after the implementation of the city’s highly controversial national security law in June, and was instrumental in influencing US lawmakers to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in November 2019. One would be hard pushed not to be awed by all Wong has achieved, or inspired by his indefatigable determination in the face of such risks to his liberty. That his campaigning efforts have captured the attention and imaginations of quite so many in the Western world is unsurprising. However, there are strong indications that unseen forces surreptitiously helped Wong along every step of the way, and consciously groomed the young activist for many years for the position he now occupies. In November 2014, the BBC’s Newsnight program broadcast an extraordinarily revealing report on the activities of theOslo Freedom Foundation(OFF). The British state broadcaster dubbed it a place where “the aristocracy of activists” meet to “share ideas and learn about agitating for positive change over champagne and canapés.” “In the basement of this four-star hotel, human-rights activists come to what feels a bit like a school for revolution,” intoned Laura Kuenssberg, then-Newsnight’s chief correspondent, now BBC News’s political editor. “This workshop? How to make sure your message – whether in Egypt, Ukraine, Hong Kong or North Korea – catches on. This may not evoke the spirit of the barricades, but the teaching here is that, to be successful, to topple a government for good, you have to be organized, and plan meticulously.” She went on to note that activists present in the class had been involved “in organizing the current protests in Hong Kong,” strikingly revealing “their plan to put thousands on the streets of the territory was, in fact, hatched nearly two years ago.” The report then cuts to an interview with Yang Jianli, who, in his mid-20s, wasinvolvedin the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and subsequently fled to the US. On his return to China in April 2002 on a friend’s passport to monitor labor unrest, he was arbitrarilydetainedfor four years, then for another year for refusing to leave the country following his release. On a table next to Yang is a laptop, via which he’s conducting a conversation with none other than Joshua Wong. Kuenssberg notes Yang has been talking to student activists in Hong Kong “on a daily, almost hourly basis,” and reiterates the fact that demonstrators in the territory were “trained, long before taking to the streets, to use non-violent action as a weapon of mass destruction.” This segues into a brief interview withJamila Raqib, Executive Director of the Albert Einstein Institution, which “advances freedom with non-violent action,” and hasreceivedfunding from, among others, US government regime-changearmthe National Endowment for Democracy (NED). “Protesters were taught how to behave in a protest, how to keep ranks, how to speak to police, how to manage their movements, how to behave when arrested,” she says. The report ends with clips of an ensuing bout of booze-fuelled revelry, Kuenssberg noting that “like at any good conference, the evenings see deals done over drinks.” “Schmoozing for democracy! To say this is a strange event hardly begins to cover it,” she says without apparent irony. “There’s something deeply incongruous about North Korean defectors, Ukrainian freedom fighters, even hackers, trading information over glasses of champagne. They call it ‘Davos for Dissidents’ for a very good reason.” Kuenssberg concludes that, while viewers will “never know” most of those in attendance at the OFF summit, “the next revolutionary, who will change their country, could just be in this room,” while members of Pussy Riot snap selfies with other attendees. Oddly, days after broadcast,the BBC issued a clarification, stating that, while the report “may have given the impression the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests were planned by foreign activists,” in fact, “references to the demonstrations were intended to mean the planning was carried out in Hong Kong, with support from abroad.” Kuenssberg’s reference to the blueprints for the Occupy Central protests being “hatched” two years prior to her report’s broadcast is conspicuous, given it was in2012that the aforementioned NED began funding the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Hong Kong to the tune of US$460,000 annually. The NDI’s objective was “to foster awareness regarding political institutions and constitutional reform … and develop the capacity of citizens – particularly university students – to more effectively participate in public debate … allowing students and citizens to explore possible reforms leading to universal suffrage.” This sounds highly relevant to the Occupy Central protests, and, inSeptember 2016, the NDI published a report on the progress of its “democratization” efforts in Hong Kong, which made repeated references to Wong, Scholarism, and Demosisto. In the meantime, NED grants and the organization’s involvement with activists in Hong Kong grew apace, expanding to include groups such as the Institute of Human Resource Management, Confederation of Trade Unions, Journalists Association, Civic Party, Labor Party and Democratic Party. NED funding extended to these groups exceeded US$1.8 million from 2017 to 2020alone– a period concurrent with ever-escalating levels of protest in Hong Kong. In 2015, the US’s Freedom House, whichworksclosely with the NED, honoured Wong alongside Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic Party and another noteworthy figure in the 2014 Occupy Central protests. The NED was founded in November 1983, and then-US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Casey was at heart of its creation. He wished to construct a publicmechanismto support groups and individuals inside “enemy” countries that would engage in propaganda and political action, which the CIA had historically organized and paid for covertly, under the bogus aegis of democracy and human-rights promotion. In 1991, senior NED official Allen Weinstein acknowledged that “a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.” Intriguingly, the Agency also played a role in the creation of the Albert Einstein Institution,  which was briefly featured in the Newsnight report. In1965, its founder, Gene Sharp, was recruited to Harvard’s Center for International Affairs, known colloquially as “the CIA at Harvard”. Its founders and staff were all prominent Cold War intellectuals, with intimate ties to the US national security state, the first co-directors being Henry Kissinger and Robert Bowie, future CIA deputy chief. It was here that Sharp, who died in 2018, created many resistance methods that have influenced protest movements the world over ever since, earning himthe nicknameof the “Machiavelli of nonviolence.” Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institution, through instructionalwritingand direct training, have helped out numerous revolutionary groups since the 1990s. They include Yugoslavia’s Otpor, which alsoreceivedmillions in NED funding, and whose members proceeded to found theCenterfor Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, which trained the various groups involved in the ‘colour revolutions’ that engulfed former Soviet states in the mid-2000s,as well askey Arab Spring activists. “The bible of Pora has been the book of Gene Sharp … it’s called ‘From Dictatorship to Democracy’. Pora activists translated it themselves. We [wrote] to Sharp … he became very sympathetic towards our initiative, and the Institution provided funding to print over 12,000 copies of this book for free,” a member of Pora, a group central to Ukraine’s ‘orange revolution’, hassaid. According toa 2006 US embassy cable published by WikiLeaks, protesters in Syria were tutored in Sharp’s writings. Another embassy cable the nextyearindicated Burmese officials feared Sharp was part of a “a vast internal and external alliance” that was trying to bring down the government. The Albert Einstein Institution staffer featured in the Newsnight clip, Jamila Raqib, is a recurrent OFF speaker, to the point that she has a dedicatedprofileon the organization’s website. It notes she worked “closely” with Sharp and that, together, they authored ‘Self-Liberation’, which OFF states “has been used throughout the world as a practical guide for nonviolent resistance.” If Raqib’s statements in the BBC report are accurate, she – and Sharp, whether directly or indirectly – had an intimate hand in training the Hong Kong protesters, even if remotely. It’s unclear which other would-be insurrectionists have benefited from their collective expertise, although White Helmets chief Raed al-Saleh spoke at the Forum’s2017 meeting, andself-avowedBelarusian president-in-waiting Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was guest-of-honour at OFF’s virtual2020 summit.

"9 Dec, 2020 15:52",Black holes can grow ‘hair’ when spinning fast enough in dramatic extension of Einstein’s theory of gravity,"An international team of scientists has found that black holes can grow ""hair"" if they spin fast enough, providing fresh insights at the fringe of our understanding of the universe. In a newstudy, researchers used numerical simulations which indicated that black holes can spontaneously erupt what has been described as a hair (otherwise known as an additionalscalar field), once they reach a certain spin speed. This new insight into the behavior of fast-spinning black holes or neutron stars would come as an extension to Einstein’s theory of gravity. “While previous studies have already provided examples of 'hairy' black hole solutions, we have shown for the first time, thanks to numerical simulations, that black holes can spontaneously grow the simplest form of permanent hair (a scalar field) once they start spinning fast enough,”says Alexandru Dima, astrophysicist at SISSA and INFN and first author of the paper. Einstein's theory of gravity and the associated mathematical theorems based on it indicate that black holes can grow 'hair' but it is eventually shed thanks to gravitational waves. According to this latest research, however, once black holes reach a certain spin speed, the hair can hang around for longer thanks to“tachyonic instability.”Additional study and calculations are required to definitively prove the findings, especially as the research is at the very frontier of gravitational research. However, these types of discoveries help further humanity’s understanding of the“dark side”of the universe, including, but not limited to, dark energy and dark matter. In addition, further discoveries and experiments could“possibly discover novel hints of new physics beyond General Relativity,”Dimu concludes. “Our results demonstrate that new physics can be quite elusive and only make an appearance when one looks carefully at the right type of black holes.” Like this story?

"27 Nov, 2020 13:34",Medical records of Brazilian PRESIDENT among 16 million Covid-19 patients EXPOSED after passwords published online – report,"Personal data of some 16 million Brazilians, including their medical records, was reportedly left exposed for almost a month after a data scientist published passwords for government Covid-19 databases. A Brazilian newspaper reported that it managed to access the medical records of President Jair Bolsonaro, his family members, seven ministers, including Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, 17 governors and other high profile figures. The records were stored in two databases listing people with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 infections and those admitted to hospitals for treatment, the newspaper Estadaosaid. There were entries for some 16 million Brazilians in them, and they contained some highly sensitive information, including personal details, pre-existing conditions like cancer or HIV, prescribed drugs or even which hospital floor a patient could have been found. This trove was exposed by a single data scientist, who published a list of logins and passwords necessary to access the databases on his personal page on the computer code repository GitHub. The newspaper said it was tipped off about the existence of the breach and verified the authenticity of the access credentials. The passwords were leaked on October 28 and removed only after Estado started digging into the security breach. The person responsible for the leak was identified as an employee of the Albert Einstein Hospital in the city of Sao Paulo. He told the newspaper he uploaded the spreadsheet while working on a computer modeling project and forgot to remove it. The passwords have since been changed by the authorities. The health ministry and the hospital promised a thorough investigation into the leak, but said it apparently happened due to a human error rather than a design flaw in their systems. It was not immediately clear why such sensitive databases seem to be protected only by passwords and didn't use some form of multiple-factor verification. More robust systems require additional information before giving users access, for example, a short code texted to a person's phone when they attempt to log in.

"23 Nov, 2020 16:37",Wayne Dupree: My family Thanksgiving this week will be business as usual. There’ll be no Covid restrictions at my dinner table,"It’s time we Americans rose up against all these enforcements on our personal liberties. I truly believe it is a trial run aimed at controlling us again in the future over some other ‘threat’, and the fightback begins now. Wayne Dupreewas recently invited to the White House to talk to President Trump on messaging to the black community. He was named in Newsmax’s top 50 Influential African-American Republicans in 2017, and, in 2016, served as a board member of the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump. Before entering politics, he served for eight years in the US Air Force. His website is here:www.waynedupree.com. Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow Burning down the city and beating up business owners? No problem. Enjoy some Turkey and stuffing with a few law-abiding citizens? Nope, that’s a crime and a threat to public health. I’ve heard and seen just about stupid enough in 2020 to last me a lifetime. Governorsacross the country have issued coronavirus restrictions ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving as cases continue to increase, and officials are advising people to “cancel,” yes, cancel, their usual celebrations. I think it’s fair to say that Democrats don’t believe in freedom. They want mommy-and-daddy government to tell them what to do, how to live, what they can and cannot eat and drink, how many and what kind of friends they can have, to tell them who the bad people are, and to buy them things. As for this virus, it can no longer be called the Wuhan or China flu, or even Covid-19. No, this has to be the Einstein Virus, because it is so damned smart it knows who to infect and on what day and time it can infect them. This “pandemic,” I truly believe, is being used to see what and how far government officials can get away with in the future. Will they be able to force lockdowns over a 0.01 percent increase in global temperatures? Based upon how well we have all obeyed theseorders, I’d say that’s a layup for the powers that be. So, the question remains: how do we say no more without being fined or cited, and have what’s left of our individual liberties and freedoms immediately impugned and reversed? I honestly don’t know. Hypocrisy is rampant at the ruling levels; that’s nothing new, nor is it set to change anytime soon. Again, though, how do we, as freedom-loving, law-abiding citizens, say no more to the draconian diktats being forced down our throats? It’s easy enough to do what we will as small groups and individuals, but I wouldn’t say I like the idea that I could be fined or cited when I sit down with seven members of my family for Thanksgiving. We have elections to vote out those politicians who impose such needless restrictions, and it’s obvious we need more freedom-loving Americans to rise up to help thwart the nonsense going on now, but what about immediately? I’m all ears. I’m pissed. And I’m ready to serve my nation in a more direct and fuller capacity. But, then we do have a medical fraud being imposed on us congruent with election fraud. Apparently, half the country gleefully, idiotically voted for a permanent, lifetime lockdown. If the globalists can convince healthy people to quarantine because they are somehow spreading infections they do not have, they can easily manipulate the entire election process using communist-inspired election software. As Trump’s coronavirus task force member, Dr. Scott Atlas, has said that the only way for this to end is if people rise! We are adults; we will decide for ourselves what is an acceptable risk. Liberty: it’s awesome, and it’s produced prosperity and safety everywhere it’s been tried. I read a tweet yesterday that I almost QTed but didn’t because she was being so naively earnest. But she said cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas this year so we can have it next year. And I was like “oh honey, we don’t believe that anymore.” Anyway, 15 days to slow the spread.https://t.co/lgeZfDa3A7 So I for one have had enough of this. I will be celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with my family. Period. Nobody will tell me who I can allow into my home or how many people can be there. When my whole family is together, there are 18 of us, and we’ve been around each other throughout this whole thing. The government can keep its nose out of my house and my personal business. If people want to sit in a closet, wear a mask, and wrap themselves in bubble wrap, that’s their choice. Good for them. I choose to celebrate the holidays responsibly with my family. Just look at the numbers. Lockdowns didn’t slow the infection rate. Masks didn’t slow the infection rate. They’ve had no positive impact whatsoever. This isn’t about infection rates or even deaths. This is about control. These people want to keep us home, keep us separated from each other, and “reset” the economy while we’re home alone. Some of them, such as Canada’s Justin Trudeau, have actuallysaidas much. My neighbor on the property behind me is having his family for Thanksgiving, many from out of state. To avoid being dimed out by some Karen, he will park several of his guest’s cars around the corner in front of my house. We aren’t hosting the big family party this year, so the coast will be clear. I hope someone knocks on my door to ask about what I am doing inside my own home. Democrats restricting the celebration of Thanksgiving has nothing to do with Thanksgiving itself. It has everything to do with their plans to abolish Christmas in 2020, and their eventual aims of banning the Bible and removing Christianity from America. They despise these fundamental principles on which our republic was formed, and on which the majority of us continue to live our lives. As long as the Bible exists, they will not rest.

"18 Nov, 2020 16:24","An elite-led ‘Great Reset’ post-Covid? No, what we need first is to get rid of the globalist approach that got us into this mess","The WEF’s vision for the future isn’t a conspiracy, but a disingenuous, dishonest manifesto from an unelected ruling class. The virus has vindicated the national state and the need for ordinary people to be part of the solutions. is a writer, speaker and consultant on innovation and technology, was most recently a Director at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he set up and led their crowdsourced innovation service. Follow him on Twitter@Norm_Lewis is a writer, speaker and consultant on innovation and technology, was most recently a Director at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he set up and led their crowdsourced innovation service. Follow him on Twitter@Norm_Lewis This week, the “Great Reset” has been trending on social media. For those not obsessed with such forums, the “Great Reset’ is the title of a manifesto for worldwide social change in the post-Covid world, written by Klaus Schwab, the founder and director of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The “Great Reset” is an important manifesto. It articulates a vision of how the global elite see the future, and in particular, how they are seizing the opportunity presented by the Covid-19 pandemic – a world that will, apparently, “never” return to normal – to remake society in their image. It’s an idea that’s been seized on by ‘progressive’ politicians and leaders everywhere, from Canada’sJustin Trudeauto Britain’sPrince Charles. On the surface, this might appear reasonable. After all, the challenges of the post-Covid world are certainly going to be huge. The economic fallout of the global lockdown, never mind the social consequences of mass unemployment and global poverty, will be unprecedented in world history. However, the “Great Reset” is sophistry and dishonesty on an unprecedented level. Who is responsible, it may be asked, for creating yesterday’s problematic ‘normal’ to which we will supposedly never return? Of course, these difficulties have nothing to do with the billionaires, political leaders, captains of industry and top regulators who swan around Davos each year, pontificating over oysters and champagne about the world’s problems, from which they benefit most. And the idea of a ‘reset’ is at best disingenuous. This implies that the global economy and society was basically functioning OK before Covid-19. That it simply requires a reboot, like switching a computer off and on again. This glosses over the reality, which is this: that the world economy and global society were in a sickly state before Covid-19, and now, being even more dependent on unprecedented state bailouts, which will take generations to repay, are in a still more parlous state. ‘Reset’ seriously underestimates the scale of the economic wreckage we face, the overhaul required, and the real barriers to the future. The “Great Reset” vision from the WEF, presented aseight projections for 2030, reveals how disconnected these people are from reality. Its tone is that of the hectoring schoolmaster who knows what’s best for the children, and tolerates no dissent. This is not a dialogue but a lecture we need to accept without question. Here they are: We’ll rent everything we’ll need, and it will be delivered by drone. Does this mean we won’t even own our ability to sell our labour? If we’re renting this and everything else, who are we renting it from? Presumably from those who own everything, who doubtless will be much happier than we will be. And drone deliveries by 2030? It will take longer than that to get regulatory permission agreed, given how risk averse both industry and governments have become. A handful of countries will dominate. This is a nice way of avoiding the obvious point that in a bipolar or multipolar world – the USA vs China vs the EU vs Russia – global decision-making is going to be even more elusive and tricky, not less. In the post-Covid world, autarkical tendencies, not cooperation, pose a threat to any notions of harmonious global governance, let alone coordination. That’s a point I’ll return to below. Transplants will be a thing of the past. New organs will be printed instead. This is a lovely notion and would be very welcome. But there’s the pesky problem of a health system that can hardly cope with seasonal flu and has had to be protected from treating ill people by shutting down the entire economy. Solving this in 10 years will require the printing of more money (which we haven’t got), never mind organs. Meat will become an occasional treat, not a staple, and we’ll eat less of it because it's good for the environment and our health. This is like the ‘choice’ offered by state telecommunications monopolies: you can have any phone you like as long as it's black. Goodbye, freedom of choice. In 10 years, we’re going to have to do a better job at welcoming and integrating refugees. Do they mean we should be as welcoming as the EU, with its “Fortress Europe” approach? Or successive American governments’ benevolent border wall with Mexico? Perhaps they’re referring to the Prince of Wales opening up Buckingham Palace to refugees? The introduction of a global price on carbon with the aim of making fossil fuels history is the holy grail being held out here. Given the parlous state of all state coffers as a result of Covid-19, and the crisis of innovation, this idea is perhaps the most fanciful of all. Scientists will have worked out how to keep us healthy in space, which will herald the start of a journey to find alien life. It might be a good idea to start by trying to keep us healthy on earth, especially dealing with all the post-Covid deaths, not from the virus, but from postponed treatments and operations. This is sheer fantasy. The checks and balances that underpin our democracies must not be forgotten. By this, they are surely not referring to the attempt to overthrow the Brexit vote or Trump’s election in 2016 by an elite who didn’t like these outcomes? They’re not suggesting that global unelected bodies such as the United Nations or the World Health Organization should take precedence over national democracies, even over decisions as important as climate change? Do they want checks and balances on national governments, which should accede to the ‘truths’ of unelected experts and technocrats, rather than relying on their own citizens to make decisions? Perish the thought. This “Great Reset” is not that great after all. Nor is it offering anything new or, indeed, realisable. Instead, it’s a rehashing of a globalist project that seeks to use the Covid crisis to prioritise the concerns and fantasies of the elite, aiming to cement their positions of wealth and power and usher in a new era of top-down diktat. The key point of unreality in all this is that the pandemic has repudiated the globalist assumptions underpinning this new utopia (or, rather, dystopia). Covid has vindicated the validity of the national state. Only nation states have had the authority to impose lockdowns and then provide – or, in some countries, try to provide – emergency financial aid to compensate businesses and families for the impact of the lockdown. Contrary to the views of the WEF, everything has not changed as a result of Covid. The changes that have happened have merely accelerated and crystallised earlier tendencies. The true state of affairs is clearer – namely, that the world is still in a state (both literally and figuratively), and that precaution and risk aversion and a sense of vulnerability still dominate the elite’s cultural zeitgeist. Albert Einstein once quipped that “No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it”. The ‘build back better’ notion at the heart of the “Great Reset” – indeed, all government visions today – is a doomed project for this reason. It is attempting to sidestep the most important lesson of the pandemic: that the future is much more dependent on the public’s willingness to embrace disruptive change than on any concrete transformation programme. We are part of the solution, not the object of elite largesse. We want to own the agenda, both now and in the future. Anything less will not make us happy, even as we order our groceries online, let alone print out a new heart or two. Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

"4 Nov, 2020 13:49","George Galloway: Has Trump won? Well, as Bill Clinton might say, it depends what you mean by ‘won’...","Donald Trump has ‘won’ the US presidential election because he has not lost it. A classic insurgent trope, he can rightly claim to have been a guerilla president even while often acting like a truculent gorilla. was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years. He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator. Follow him on Twitter@georgegalloway was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years. He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator. Follow him on Twitter@georgegalloway The might of the American deep state and the unprecedented levels of excoriation, detestation and hate from the liberal classes have failed to break Donald Trump. The four-year Russiagate scam, the phony impeachment and the Mueller Report all tried and failed, too. His vote has gone UP from 2016. The supposed ‘racist’ appears to have scored more support among ‘communities of colour’ than he did last time. The man who is said to use the N-word and to have thought Black Lives Didn’t Matter Much gained more votes from black men. The vulgar sexist got more votes from women. The man who ‘caged’ Latino children at the borderlands saw his vote rise amongst Latinos and Latinas. In fact, Trump’s vote is up amongst every demographic of gender and ethnicity except white men – the very people he is imagined to have exclusively appealed to with every Coke-fuelled burp and hamburger-fuelled pump. Virtually every commentator in America is left with egg on their face. There was no ‘blue wave’. The president’s party – for that is what it is – won seats in the House and the Democrats’ flipping of the Senate is as flat as a pancake. President Donald Trump has ‘coat-tails’. Who'd have thunk it? Even the most noxious of the president’s men – Lindsey Graham and Moscow Mitch McConnell – triumphed, pulled over the line by the circus act that is Trump. The Democratic gamble of fielding, for the second time running, the only candidate who could lose to Donald Trump has clearly failed, whatever happens next. Centrism is not the winning hand against right-wing populism, something parties in Europe had better learn fast. In this case, the donkeys in America already knew that, but decided to test Einstein’s law to destruction. Trying the same thing over again and expecting a different result is indeed a definition of madness. All of the above is true, whatever the final result of the imbroglio. Trump’s brazen press conference in which he simultaneously claimed victory and fraud was exactly what a right-wing populist would do. And perfectly timed – he was well ahead in the Midwest rust-belt when inexplicable abandonment of counting for the night was the optimal moment to cry-foul. Trump might be a moron, but he certainly ain’t stupid. He tripled his majority in Florida, and comfortably won Texas and Ohio, where the shattered punditocracy had claimed the opposite would happen. It seems obvious that the liberal-centrists of America don’t know their country at all. The east and west coast political salons – a giant, self-referential bubble – are bust. The man who has presided over the coronavirus catastrophe, governs a maelstrom of mass unemployment, mass poverty and extreme levels of hunger and homelessness, has somehow won. Even if it depends what you mean by won. Onwards to the Supreme Court, stuffed to the gills with conservative justices, like a giant Christmas turkey. It’s enough to make a horse laugh.

"25 Oct, 2020 08:44","Slate calls for Mozart & Beethoven to be referred to by their full names to fight ‘sexism and racism,’ leaving Twitter baffled","Calling famous classical music composers just by their last names can be “harmful” nowadays, according to an article published in US liberal magazine Slate. The piece was instantly mocked online. Writing for Slate, Chris White, an assistant professor of music theory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, took issue with how some composers, like Beethoven or Mozart, are often referred to just by their last names, while others are not. In fact, continuing to use such mononyms today could be seen as""outdated and harmful,""he argued. When we say, 'Tonight, you'll be hearing symphonies by Brahms and Edmond Dede,' we're linguistically treating the former as being on a different plane than the latter, a difference originally created by centuries of systematic prejudice, exclusion, sexism, and racism. To change the situation, the author urged people to use the composers' full names so""we can focus more on their music rather than on the past cultural practices that elevated straight white men at the expense of everyone else."" The piece was immediately ridiculed online, with many feeling its take was far-fetched and too much even for a liberal magazine.""I want to sit in on one of your pitch meetings. The stories that don't make the cut, have to be better than what you publish,""one readertweeted. ""Stop making fun of Slate,"" another jokinglyremarked. Some even vowed to only use Mozart's""complete""baptismal name from now on, which consists of four different names. only using mozart's complete name from now on, because I hate racism that muchpic.twitter.com/ivow29Zepd People tried to school the author on why mononyms stick to particular composers in the first place. ""If there were a well-known Bob Beethoven or Jimmy Wagner, we would make the distinction. We include Edmond Dede's first name because he is not as well known,"" a person wrote. ""What silliness at Slate!""one tweetread.""Dede isn't the musical equal of Beethoven. Fame not racism allows us to identify the composer by surname alone. That goes for Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, too. And artists and scientists like Picasso and Einstein, also."" Another Twitter useraddedthat it is the""same with people who are so famous they can go by their first name, which include a lot of women and people of color: Oprah, Beyonce, Ellen, Kanye, Chappelle, Kobe, Hillary, LeBron.""

"15 Oct, 2020 15:59",We’ve made the world crap enough for kids as it is. It’s time to award elitist school exams an F-off and ditch them for good,"The UK government’s plans to make school exams even more stressful is the latest example of a crazy global obsession with harmful and unfair testing. It’s time to create a better, more meritocratic world by dumping the whole idea. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. “Childhood,”they say.“The best years of your life.” How depressing. It implies that most of us are past the tipping point on the happiness graph, plummeting ever downwards. For morale purposes, they really should PR old age a bit more. ‘They’ are also basically saying to kids that this is as good as it gets. Make the most of your youth because adulthood is a nightmare. Perhaps this is why grown-ups are levelling things down by making childhoods significantly less enjoyable through what I believe to be a carefully-coordinated global campaign of child cruelty. I call it Make Childhood Grate Again. Through MCGA, we’ve made the air so foul that they won’t even be able toremember their childhoods. We’ve made parents so scared of paedophiles, terrorists and children’s TV presenters that they won’t let their offspring play alone outside without surveillance systems or security teams in place. We’ve invented social media platforms to devastate their social skillsand self-esteemand make them do stupid dances. We’ve tortured their tiny heads withBaby Shark. We’ve built an economy in which they’re more likely to make a living by filming themselves playing video games than being, for example, useful. And if that isn’t bad enough, we still make them sit exams – the one really crappy childhood thing that most of us get to avoid as adults. In fact, the UK government is looking to make the experience even more gruesome. After handlingthe summer’s exam crisis(all part of MCGA) in a way that was tragically stupid and insensitive even by its own impressive standards, it’s decided that it doesn’t want to risk pupils’ grades being assessed using such unreliable factors as the opinions of teachers who have taught them for two years. Instead, Gavin Williamson – a man whose qualifications for any job, let alone education secretary, are questionable – wants to havestricter mock examswhose results could be used if final exams are cancelled again. So the kids will have to suffer un-mocked stress levels twice, with the added bonus of knowing that, if they do really well in the high-stakes practice tests, it could well count for nothing. Perhaps the cruellest aspect of all this is that they shouldn’t be sitting exams at all. No kid should. Exams should be flushed down the toilet of educational history to join corporal punishment and tapioca pudding in the schooldays-of-yore sewer. The whole notion of exam-heavy education systems is not only outdated, inefficient and illogical, it’s damaging to kids, the economy, society and basically anyone who hasn’t popped out of a privileged womb straight into a blanket of cosy elitist comfort. For some reason, the world is test-obsessed and not always in a fun pub-quiz way. We test kids at school from an age at which few even know what a test is and make sure we keep testing them, with ever-increasing pressure levels, until they’re old enough to legally avoid being tested. It’s like a cycle of abuse. We had to do exams as children and thus we can’t help but inflict them on later generations, despite knowing how painful and pointless they are. There’s the weird, sadistic ritualism. Kids are filed into a room by austere teachers like lambs to slaughter, only lambs don’t know what’s coming to them. A big deal is made of the rules and the time limit before the countdown – one of humanity’s most nerve-wracking creations – is ceremonially begun. This, of course, comes after weeks, months and years of being told how crucial these exams are to their life chances – something that is absolutelyscrewing with their mental health. Forget developing conversational skills or keeping fit or learning how to cook: what really matters, kiddies, is how much you can memorise. Memorise and then, of course, almost immediately forget. Ask yourself, if you sat your school exams right now, what grades would you get? I can barely evenspell“syense” these days. Some argue that exams prepare kids for adulthood. I’m not sure what kind of adulthood these people have endured, but they have my sympathy. I find that, when I need to learn something, I research it. If I then forget it, I find it out again. My life isn’t suddenly shunted off the rails or the hole in my knowledge permanently etched in the public record. At work, I’ve generally been assessed by what I do throughout the year. I’ve had my bad days and my better days, but my bosses have always had a reasonable idea of how good I am at my job. I’ve never been sat in a silent room in June and asked to bash out an article, in under two hours and without access to the internet, that will determine my future employment. Annual reviews, you say? Yes, we all take those very seriously. Exams favour kids (and schools) who can work the system. Those with better resources who can learn by rote and put down the answers the exam boards want, rather than any that involve imagination or critical thought. This is why so many top jobs are filled by rule-following automatons. Establishment bootlickers who wouldn’t know an original thought if it bit them on the baccalaureate. The system perpetuates privilege by putting in power those who benefit from the system. A bit like, well, most things really. Some kids, even some geniuses, simply don’t cope well with exam conditions, warping the results and nudging the scales further in favour of the machines. ""Oh, but it teaches them to deal with pressure,""I hear. Not any kind of pressure that might be useful, it doesn’t. I prefer my doctor to give me the right treatment, not swot up on my condition the night before and try to cure me ‘against the clock’ while wired off his bonce on caffeine pills. I’ll admit to some bias. I have the memory of a particularly forgetful twig. I’m the anti-elephant, the anti-Rainman – the anti-Elephant Man (I hope). So I never liked exams. But I also never saw how they were in any way a measure of my ability. Ditching exams for ongoing assessment would make the world a better and more meritocratic place. It would not only improve students’ mental state but also their analytical and research skills, their retention of knowledge and the chances of them trying to do well all the time, rather than temporarily cramming info into their young brains. We’d get smarter, more creative people doing the important jobs, not just the ones who know how to play the game. And if you don’t agree with me, take it up with my pal Albert (Einstein), whowrote,“The teachers’ impression of a student derived during the school years, together with the usual numerous papers from assignments – which every student has to complete – are a succinctly complete and better basis on which to judge the student than any carefully executed examination.” Memorise that.

"6 Oct, 2020 10:39",Nobel Prize awarded to trio of BLACK HOLE scientists who discovered supermassive object and proved Einstein right,"A trio of scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discoveries which deepened humanity's understanding of black holes. Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were unveiled as the newest Nobel winners on Tuesday.“The discoveries of this year's Laureates have broken new ground in the study of compact and supermassive objects,”said David Haviland, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics. The trio will split the 10 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize. BREAKING NEWS: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the 2020#NobelPrizein Physics with one half to Roger Penrose and the other half jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez.pic.twitter.com/MipWwFtMjz Briton Roger Penrose, 89, was awarded his share of the accolade for “the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity” or, in other words, for confirming that Einstein was right. A close friend of Stephen Hawking, Penrose developed mathematical models to put Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to the test, and, after much number-crunching, confirmed that black holes,“one of the most exotic objects in the universe,”form exactly as predicted. Meanwhile, German Reinhard Genzel, 68, and American Andrea Ghez, 55, received their share of the prize“for the discovery of a supermassive compact object”at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. Genzel and Ghez cleared the dust away from the center of our galaxy and discovered several stars orbiting around an invisible, but incredibly massive object, roughly four million times the mass of our sun. From this discovery, came our now well-established understanding that all galaxies boast supermassive black holes. On Monday, another trio of scientists were awarded the Nobel prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the hepatitis C virus. Other prizes to be announced over the coming days include the prize for outstanding work in the fields of chemistry, literature, peace and economics. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"27 Sep, 2020 13:04",Straight out of science fiction: Physicist discovers that paradox-free time travel is mathematically possible,"New research has unravelled paradoxes at the heart of time travel, making it far more than just the plot of countless Hollywood blockbusters but something that is mathematically possible. Both scientists and scriptwriters alike have long been fascinated by the prospect of travelling through time. Numerous popular films have also shown that it can result in all sorts of unexpected consequences. One of the major contradictions is known as the ‘Grandfather paradox’. The paradox holds that any action that alters the past, is a contradiction because the past becomes different from how it was. If you travel back in time and prevent your parents from meeting, how could you be born to travel back in time in the first place? A physics student from the University of Queensland in Australia says he has unravelled the maths behind time tinkering and made it viable without the paradoxes. “Classical dynamics says if you know the state of a system at a particular time, this can tell us the entire history of the system,”researcher Germain Tobar explained.“However, Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts the existence of time loops or time travel – where an event can be both in the past and future of itself – theoretically turning the study of dynamics on its head.” The researcher used the example of the coronavirus pandemic to explain his incredibly dense math. If a time traveller journeyed to the past to stop the disease from spreading, if they were successful there would have been no disease to send them back to eliminate. However, Tobar’s work found that the virus would still escape in some other way. No matter what the time traveller did, the disease wouldn’t be stopped, so the paradox is removed. The deeply theoretical work focuses on the influence of deterministic processes on an arbitrary number of regions in the space-time continuum. Tobar demonstrated how both closed timelike curves (which were predicted by Albert Einstein) can fit in with the rules of free will and classical physics. “The maths checks out – and the results are the stuff of science fiction,”said physicist Fabio Costa from the University of Queensland, who supervised the research. Tobar’s study was published in the Classical and Quantum Gravity journal. Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"26 Aug, 2020 14:07",Anti-Trump Twitter UNWOKES itself to go after Melania for being an immigrant and a woman following RNC speech,"Anti-Republican partisans online appeared to abandon any pro-women and pro-immigrant rhetoric to mock Melania Trump’s accent, appearance and even to doubt her visa following the first lady’s RNC speech. In her address at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, Melaniaurgedto“stop the violence”at the ongoing anti-racism protests, and expressed her sympathies for Americans hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The speech’s substance was largely ignored by some Twitter users, who went on to ridicule the first lady for being an immigrant from Slovenia. The criticism of Melania often came down to her having a noticeable accent.“She still can’t speak English,”tweeted actress Bette Midler during the speech. Melania has coaches who should help her with her English. She's the fu*king First Lady! Oh, God. She still can’t speak English. Other comments included speculation that Melania’s so-called ‘Einstein’ visa from 2001 was fake. Again, Midler chimed in to call the first lady an“illegal alien”who needed to be taken off the stage. When Melania came to the US she was an illegal sex working immigrant who married a man for a fake visa and then brought her whole family over through chain migration which your party hates so much. Also sex work, and christian values don’t go to together ! #beBestis back! A UGE bore! She can speak several words in a few languages. Get that illegal alien off the stage! Some of Melania’s other detractors made jokes about her appearance, and condemned her doing nude modeling in the 90’s. Melania, ""please phone home""pic.twitter.com/Qj2fPcdws8 Watching Melania last night I could not stop visualizing her standing their naked as we have seen pics !https://t.co/bdGlGq6CQ4 All these sentiments seemed to go against the Republican’s opposition’s usual advocacy towards respect for women and immigrants. And this contradiction was not lost on either the left or the right.Self-described“proud socialist”podcaster Ryan Night called the comments“beyond gross,”and said that“liberals were so bad”that he “had to” defend the Republican first lady. When Liberals are so bad that you have to defend Melania Trump. This is beyond gross@BetteMidlerand I am no fan of the First Lady. You have become what you think you are “resisting.”https://t.co/UhVM5jDlU2 Lauren Boebert, Republican nominee for Congress in Colorado, pondered if this was“the tolerance and love”the Democratic Party claims to preach. Bette Midler referred to Melania Trump as an illegal immigrant during her speech last night & even had the nerve to criticize her English (she speaks five languages, Bette).Is this the tolerance and love that the Democrat Party refers to?#RNC2020 Like this story?

"24 Aug, 2020 14:04",Let there be light… so long as it’s decolonised. Right-on academics condemn the science of illumination as ‘white male dominated’,"According to a new Canadian university project, physics is “a mirror of colonial patterns and social inequality,” particularly “in the context of light.” This is all not just baffling, but dangerously bonkers. Rob Lyonsis a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panicon a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'. Rob Lyonsis a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panicon a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'. In the light of Black Lives Matter and the decision by Oriel College at Oxford University to move its statue of Sir Cecil Rhodes, the idea of“decolonising”education has made serious headway, with many institutions now reworking curricula to better reflect diversity and black and ethnic minority concerns. There are plenty of problems with that outlook. It suggests that ethnic minority writers and thinkers should be included in college courses because of the colour of their skin, rather than the brilliance of their ideas. It also suggests that students can only really learn if education is“relevant”to them. After decades of fighting for equality, it seems we are now re-racialising society. Worse, this re-racialisation is seen as progressive. But the idea of decolonising has gone further, suggesting that there are different systems of knowledge between cultures, and that these different“ways of knowing”are equivalent; that hey all deserve“respect,”rather than scepticism and testing. A new example of this is a project at Concordia University in Canada calledDecolonizing Light. The project introduction explains: “Even more than other sciences, physics is a white male dominated field and, thus, a mirror of colonial patterns and social inequality. Despite this fact, physics is considered as ‘hard’ and objective science, disconnected from social life and geopolitical history. This narrative both constitutes and reproduces inequality, which is reflected by the underrepresentation of women, racialized people, and Indigenous peoples in physics.” There's nothing wrong with striving to ensure that institutional barriers don't get in the way of everyone – regardless of sex or ethnic background – being able to pursue study and a career in physics. But this project seems to go further, seeking to investigate“how colonial scientific knowledge authority was and is still reproduced in the context of light”. The researchers are exploring“Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies”and“studying colonial anchor points in the history of physics in the context of light.” If you find this kind of language a bit baffling, you're not alone. Exploring ideas from different sources can certainly be valuable. But this project seems to be saying that these different forms of knowledge should be kept in silos, intellectually and morally equivalent to each other. If that is what is being suggested, it's an awful idea. (And if that's not what is being suggested, maybe an introductory course on writing in plain English would help.) The enormous success of science, through the Renaissance to the Enlightenment and beyond, is grounded on the central principle that there is an objective world out there we can endeavour to understand. We'll never quite get there – there will always be new layers of understanding to be achieved. For example, Newton's theories from the seventeenth century are brilliant, but they don't work at massive scale, as Einstein showed, nor do they work at the sub-atomic level, as we now know from the mind-bending work of quantum physicists. (As a leading light of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, memorably noted:“Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.”) How do we improve our understanding? Through rigorous observation and the constant questioning and development of theories to explain those observations. This is auniversalandhumanisticproject that relentlessly questions what we consider to be the truth. Far from confirming power structures, this outlook is revolutionary. Far from being the product of authority, it is capable of undermining long-established authority. Look at how Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin came to undermine religious teaching on the origins and central importance of humankind. It turned out that the Earth is just another lump of rock orbiting a star, and that humans – far from being fashioned from scratch by God – are simply the evolved descendants of apes. (None of which stopped some leading nineteenth-century thinkers having backward views about Africans, for example.) The reality of science doesn't always live up to this ideal. The many successes of science have given it an authority that is then sometimes used to stifle debate. Just look at the way scepticism about some of the claims of climate-change science has been used to denounce those raising these objections as ‘deniers’.“The science says…”has become a way of demanding that a particular set of policiesmustbe implemented and opponents must be ostracised. Within the scientific world, professors who have Nobel Prizes on their shelves often don't take kindly to upstarts trying to overturn their much-cherished theories. Nonetheless, we can and should apply those universal principles of science. To give up on that historic project would be a serious mistake. While many different societies and cultures have insights into the world, the fact remains that science and technology, as they developed through the Enlightenment tradition, have liberated billions from need and from the vagaries of nature. The key is to test ideas from other cultures and bring them into the scientific mainstream. “Indigenous” medicine, agriculture and even physics that are tested and found to be valuable stop being “indigenous” – they're just science, pure and simple. Equally, if those ideas are tested and found to be erroneous, they should be rejected. We don't need to be parochial about that, either. The West has produced plenty of wrong-headed ideas of its own – from homeopathy to the idea that 5G wireless networks cause Covid-19. Every idea, whatever its source, should be rigorously tested and debated. As the old motto of London's Royal Society famously put it, “Nullius in verba”– essentially, “take no one's word for it.” This philosophy has served the world very well for centuries. We should always strive for a single, universal and complete understanding of the world. We will never get there, but the aim is an entirely laudable one. We should never give in to the destruction of knowledge into myriad different “ways of knowing.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"16 Aug, 2020 06:54","The five biggest coronavirus myths BUSTED! Exposing the fear mongering, propaganda and outright lies that are plaguing the world","The coronavirus misinformation that scientists, politicians and media have fed to the public has been shocking. Take a tour through the bizarre, contradictory and downright ludicrous myths that have done more damage than Covid. ByPeter Andrews, Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics. TRIGGER WARNING! Do not read this if you are a loyal member of the Branch Covidians, cravenly awaiting the pleasure-pain prick of the Covid vaccine before you will appear in your own garden without a face nappy. Or rather, do read it, but don’t expect to like it. There is no place for assumptions here—only logical thought from first principles. The only aim is to debunk the biggest myths that the media and political establishment have propagated. And if you can hear me out then I salute you; there are few of us left who hold open minds. This is the fundamental premise of the world’s ‘response’ to Covid, from which all else springs. But it has never been established that we should be trying to slow the virus down, not even from the blinkered point of view of just saving lives in the short term. Slowing the spread of the virus was initially sold to us as a way of protecting health services: if everyone gets sick at once, the hospitals will fill to bursting point and people will die on gurneys in car parks outside. Remember ‘flatten the curve’? Since Covid infections are inevitable, spreading them out through time willindirectlysave lives by ensuring that everyone whocanbe saved by medical interventions - oxygen masks and ventilators - will be. A noble idea, but as it happened, a misguided one. Most hospitals spent the months of the outbreak as good asempty. All other medical treatments were postponed in order to prepare for the onslaught of Covid patients coughing their lungs up—an onslaught that never arrived. Even intensive care units rarely reachedfull capacity, and it quickly became apparent that for the people most at risk from Covid, ventilator and intensive care treatment is unsuitable. Only a tiny minority of those who have died actually died in intensive care—old people with many co-morbidities arebest keptin ordinary wards. So ‘flatten the curve’ was a dead duck, but doesn’t it make sense to slow the spread of the virus anyway? Well, only if you think that those who would die of Covid if they caught it can evade the virus until a vaccine is developed. If vulnerable people who believe that they have not caught the virus (they may be asymptomatic) want to wait for a putative vaccine, then they should be more upfront about their intentions. Because if they can’t, then there is no point to any of this. In addition, there is at least one theory why you could be doing someone a favour by giving them the virus. Evolutionary theory tells us that as a respiratory virus spreads, it loses potency. A successful virus is a mild one, which does not kill its host before they can spread it. This is how herd immunity really works in this context: it’s about the changes to the virus itself. In contrast, when we locked down, the virus had nowhere to go. Instead of getting milder, all of the most dangerous strains came together in the only places where sick people gathered: nursing homes and hospitals. This is why Igreetednews that the virus was becoming more contagious with jubilation—it is better that the virus spread freely, at least among the healthy. But let’s pretend for a while that it isn’t better. Because without the fundamental assumption thatspreading = bad, the rest of the discussion is flipped on its head. ‘Spikes’ become cause for relief, not concern. Masks, if they work, would become counter-productive. I am not claiming this as truth—only that it is at least as likely as the classical model. But if you can suspend your disbelief for long enough to imagine that hindering the spread of the virus is worthwhile, then you might be forgiven for assuming that lockdowns are the way to do it. There is, however, no suggestion, let alone evidence, that lockdowns would pose a problem for a wily virus. If lockdowns played any part at all, we would expect to see a correlation between the different forms of lockdowns enforced by various regions or countries, and the shape of the death curves there. But we do not—the correlation is zero. Belgium, the UK, New York: strict lockdowns; lots of deaths. Sweden, Japan, Uruguay: light or no lockdowns; few deaths. You can point to opposite examples, but that’s just the point—there is no consistency. And before you try to explain away individual countries with hand waving about ‘different cultures’ or ‘better testing’, there is no correlation with any of those things either. Simply put, there is nothing that can be easily pointed at to suggest that any measure taken by any government in the world to block the virus has worked. Lockdowns may be the biggest tools in the shed, but they are still faulty. Early in the outbreak, there seemed to be a connection between those countries with impressive track and trace capabilities, likeGermanyandSouth Korea, and their ability to cope. Of course, the tracking and tracing itself could not have been ‘curing’ the population of Covid. No one knew why there seemed to be a positive effect from comprehensive testing. Months later, still no one knows. But that has not stopped western governments from pathetic attempts to emulate the conformist East Asian societies with contact tracing apps and programmes. Despite a not inconsiderable propaganda campaign, they have allfailed miserably. This is largely because not enough people even have any symptoms anymore, months after the virus peaked. Trying to ramp up contact tracing in August goes beyond locking the barn door after the horse has bolted. This horse bolted so long ago that now herds of its descendants roam the countryside. Meanwhile, the farmer ruins his homestead in order to pour his resources into increasingly elaborate and expensive door locking contraptions. For BAME, insert whatever ethnic or other minority you have read is worst affected by the virus outbreak. Of course, the virus is racist—everything else is. Factoids like this come from dividing the sick or the dead into their Woke groupings and then comparing the proportions to the population as a whole. And no doubt, BAME people are ‘over represented’ in such statistics. But the risk is at the population level, and is almost entirely explained by mediating factors like obesity, diabetes and other co-morbidities, more prevalent in some populations than in others. If you are in your eighties, overweight and sickly, then you should be worried about catching the virus regardless of your race. Similarly, if you are fit and under 60 you are more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by the virus, regardless of your race. There has been a suggestion, but only a suggestion, that lower Vitamin D levels in black people could play a part, but that is not behind the disparities. This basic statistical point makes ridiculous the notion that some professional athletes were worried about returning to their sport. I actually feel sorry for the likes ofTroy Deeney(not just because he’s been relegated with Watford) but because he has been understandably frightened by poor scientific communication. As a healthy young BAME man, there is no reason to suspect that he himself is at an increased risk. But he has been persuaded that he is by a regime that distils power from fear. What utter rot this is. The individual who came up with thisfalse trade-offwould have a bright career in board game design, if they were not earning so much as a public servant. This is simply a fabrication, and as such somewhat difficult to disprove, rather like the existence of invisible fairies. You could just, you know, leave the pubs open and then open the schools too? But I suppose then there would be a ‘second wave’ in deaths two weeks later. You know, like the second wave that was warned of inMay. And thenJune. And then July. Only in the past two weeks did the WHO finally give up the dream and change itsstoryto ‘One Big Wave’, which doesn’t have the same ring to it. But the second wave fiction has not yet been memory holed—it can be trotted out on demand to force through any further assaults on our remaining freedoms. All I can do is predict that a second wave in deaths will never materialise, and every day since April I have been proven right. The establishment, in contrast, makes wrong predictions again and again, and are never held to account. They just change the prediction, and hope everyone forgets about what they said a week ago. Don’t wear masks. Don’t go to work. Go to work, but don’t take public transport. But if you do, wear a mask. Do not be fooled into thinking that the confusion is incidental. It is part of the plan—confused people are easier to control. It may have been Joseph Goebbels who said: ‘’If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.’’ It seems this is an evergreen statement; not only is there no limit to the size of the lie, there seems to be no limit on the number of lies either. Hypotheses make predictions, and if they are consistently proven right, eventually they become theory. Einstein is heralded because he made predictions about black holes that are only being proven true almost a century later. Many fine minds have put their necks out to make predictions about the nature of this outbreak, despite slime and slander from the cheerleaders of the elite. But when they are vindicated, the cheerleaders just drown them out. In contrast, Neil Ferguson isrolled outagain and the second wavers just keep saying ‘wait another two weeks’. When will this end? Never. Not until we have a complete rethink. Logic and reason have not worked. It’s time for a new approach. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"29 Jul, 2020 16:11","In a world of poverty and injustice, mask-hating Facial Justice Warriors have finally found a cause worth fighting for","With limited time and passion to give to causes, it’s crucial we choose ours well. So well done Facial Justice Warriors for ignoring other issues until a fight worth fighting came along – being asked to occasionally wear a mask Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Bob Geldof once spoke of compassion fatigue: the notion that we have limited emotional resources when it comes to ‘doing our bit’ for a good cause. We can’t help everyone all the time, so it’s important to choose your battles wisely. This is why I salute the Facial Justice Warriors (FJWs), a term I have coined for those people tirelessly and selflessly campaigning against rarely-enforced laws requiring them to wear a face mask for a few minutes if they happen to be, say, in a shop or on a bus, in an attempt to slow the spread of Covid-19. While others have spent their precious energy campaigning against things like poverty, crime and injustice, the FJWs have bided their time, waiting for areallyserious issue to trigger their activism. And now they have it: an annoying dress code. We’ve had anti-mask marches, we’ve hadBible-quotingmask truthers marching through supermarkets (warning: the truth may differ from truther to truther), we’ve had a wave of maskless selfies from brave FJWs risking the wrath of apathetic teenage shop assistants and, of course, we’ve had the FJW online battalions warning us of the #plandemic. And what warriors they are. Why does every ‘no mask selfie’ picture look like they’re staring into their microwave, waiting for a ready-meal to cook.pic.twitter.com/i8zNYPJtlJ These people willabsolutely notbe told to wear a mask for a small percentage of their week, even if there is a reasonable chance that doing so could prevent people from catching an unpleasant and potentially fatal virus because the FJWs’ civil liberties are far more important. They will not allow a minor inconvenience to interfere with their lives when instead they can protect us from sadistic governments who havefinallyfound a way to control our behaviour having failed to do so for millennia with all those other laws. FJWs, I can only assume, also refuse to submit to such authoritarian liberty-destroying diktats such as having to drive on a designated side of the road or wear clothes in public places. If only they’d been around in World War II. While all those sheeple were complying with blackout rules and rationing, the FJWs would have been having black market BBQs and laser shows in their back gardens, really telling Churchill and whoever the 1940s Bill Gates was (Einstein?) where to shove their science. Because did you know thatstatistically, the chances of you dying from a German bomb were less than those of you dying from tripping over a kerb in a pitch-black street or from not eating enough butter? True fact. These guys are sticking it to the Man for the greater good. They could have campaigned to end homelessness or improve mental health awareness. They could have taken on (actual) bullying or racism. They could have mentored vulnerable young people or worked to rehabilitate offenders. But no, they’ve found an even higher hill and they’re going to die on it, with their final breath unhindered by cloth. They will ignore the fact that, while you can dispute the infection and death rates, only the most dedicated conspiracy theorist doesn’t believe the coronavirus pandemic is real and that wearing a mask in the very limited situations where it’s requiredmightjust impede its effects. They will also ignore how limited those situations are. They will trot out evidence that they got off Twitter of masks actually killing people or increasing acne or something, which is why medical staff, factory workers and people in the Far East who wear them for hours a day in non-pandemic times are always keeling over in the street. They will point to conflicting data about the efficacy of masks and argue that it’s “inconclusive” but refuse to err on the side of caution when they can err on the side of doing whatever they want, consequences be damned. They will ignore that fact that almost no-onelikeswearing a mask and very few want to, but that most people don’t really see it as a big deal and realise that it’s a temporary nuisance. They will ignore that fact that governments clearly don’twantto make people wear masks because it’s not, and has never been, a vote-winning policy. And, of course, they will ignore accusations of hypocrisy. I have every faith that if you had a Venn diagram that showed the cross over between FJWs flouting these laws and the people who are very much in favour of strict enforcement by the state of any rules they agree with, perhaps things like “getting tough” with other kinds of protesters, then you could call that diagram a “circle.” Which is great because, when they go to the supermarket to take their rebellious selfie or save our souls from all the lies, they can get their cake and eat it – without anything getting in their way. They will do all this because, well, probably because they’re amazing, selfless people who simply want #justiceforfaces. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"20 Jul, 2020 11:40","No one’s flying and MILLIONS of jobs might be lost – but airlines took billions, CEOs got rich and employees got screwed, again","Millions of people are fearful and permanently out of work. The supply chain devastation will continue with a tsunami of defaults, starting with the airlines who promised not to fire employees in return for bailouts. Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi Last week saw drug maker Moderna surge over 20 percent and a few transportation stocks, most notably within the airline sector, surge over 15 percent in a matter of hours. Retail and cruise-line shares steamed higher as well. We also saw another claim from a big pharma drug pusher that it has a miracle vaccine for Covid-19 (let us sell billions of these VACCINES!). Did someone hit a magic switch that turned the economy back into high gear? Has everything been forgiven? The real question is can we ever go back to the way everything was and ignore the economic carnage caused by the global economic depression we entered a few months ago? Albert Einstein defined insanity as“repeating the same thing over and over and expecting to achieve a different result.”Unfortunately, that seems to be exactly what we’re doing. The airlines frittered away billions in stock buybacks – American Airlines alone spent $13 billion on share buybacks. Airlines received at least $50 billion in government bailouts that taxpayers will be on the hook for when they go bankrupt. As I explained (here), American Airlines’ CEO Doug Parker was paid 150 million dollars to crash the airline that will cost tens of thousands of jobs – jobs that will be gone forever. The mainstream media is reporting on the 25,000 jobs AA is preparing to furlough, but is failing – or refusing – to see the macroeconomic big picture and the reality that MILLIONS of jobs could be on the line. Here are some pictures I took of New York's eerily empty JFK airport as I was flying back to the UK last week. Frightening? It is clear that the business and the ancillary supply-chain businesses (leases and purchases from Boeing, airplane parts, airline maintenance, jet fuel, food services, employees to clean planes and airports) are not returning anytime soon. We are talking MILLIONS of jobs across the airline supply chain that will never return. Will airlines go bankrupt? YES! Why wasn't Parker fired and the board sacked? Why did the government fund $10 billion in bailouts when 25,000 people are about to be sacked? What caused the current global economic depression and are the governments being honest about it? The credit crisis that began in earnest back in 2008 was caused by too much debt, credit and leverage. Then it hit high gear with Boris Johnson’s top adviser shrieking“2.2 million Americans and over half a million Brits will die from coronavirus.”This statement was the shot that ended democracy around the world, and it came from Dr Neil Ferguson and his Imperial College“models”funded by Microsoft's Bill Gates. The full report ishere. New York City’s economy is in the tank. It is estimated that over fifty percent of the small businesses that closed due to Covid-19 will never reopen. This means millions of jobs are gone forever, and it will cause more vacant commercial real estate to come onto an already over-supplied property market. Property prices in cities will collapse and, as job losses continue, we will see a catastrophic increase of defaults on residential mortgages that will cause a broader collapse in all property prices. The global economy is in an economic depression, illustrated and compounded by massive unemployment, contracting gross domestic product, staggering amounts of private and public debt and a wealth inequality gap that has rocketed to stratospheric new highs. Central Banks, aka rogue hedge funds, have printed trillions of dollars. These funds have re-inflated asset bubbles to wildly grotesque levels of valuation that have never been seen. US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank money went to Apple, which helped Apple conduct record amounts of share buybacks, putting AAPL’s stock price at new record highs and a billion dollars in Apple CEO Tim Cook’s pocket. Did any of this help Main Street? Nope. These reckless policies inflated the most outrageous valuations, bubbles, and greed in history. For example, Tesla traded above $1,800 per share this week. We now have Covid-induced fear and irrationally greedy markets – a toxic, unsustainable combination. Big governments worldwide have massively increased their debt with a false belief, instilled by Keynesian economic charlatans, that if you print more money, you can print demand. Remember Harvard’s Larry Summers? He convinced Bill Clinton to get rid of Glass Steagall and blew up Citibank with Robert Rubin. Summers and Paul Krugman are now jumping on the Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and AOC bandwagon of“Free stuff for everyone”. The lunatics are running the asylum, and as Albert Einstein said,“The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting to achieve a different result.”It’s a safe bet this global depression will devastate the financial markets as it slowly deleverages and wipes out the reckless gamblers.

"27 Jun, 2020 21:45",‘You’re always crazy until you’re right’: BLM leader compares Defund the Police to innovators like Steve Jobs & Einstein on RT,"Greater New York Black Lives Matter president Hawk Newsome told RT President Donald Trump is encouraging violence against him and the Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police movements, which are led by “changemakers.” Newsome gained national attention this week following atweetfrom the president that suggested the BLM leader is a traitor for his comments about“burning”down the American system if his movement is not given what it wants. The tweet, Newsome says,“put a target on a movement that most Americans see as favorable.”He suggests Trump“riled up his base to be violent toward myself and toward other activists.” Newsome provided no examples of this potential violence against him and“other activists,”but he has said he does not condemn the“rioting”seen at protests over the death of George Floyd across the nation. As for what his demands from the“system”are, the BLM leader says the Defund the Police movement needs to find more support from the government and more police officers need to be“put in jail.” “Hawk” Newsome, a high-school-dropout turned Big Law firm project-manager who now helps lead the Black Lives Matter movement, says it helps to know more about the law than the police. Newsome always knew he wanted to be a lawyer. But he set out on a different path in his last year at Touro law school in 2012 following the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. #BlackOPTS @theblackopts @blackopportunities #BLMNY A post shared byHawk Newsome, J.D.(@hawk.newsome) onJun 13, 2020 at 4:36pm PDT Newsome believes police are not always necessary to stop crimes and funding for departments should be going to“education”and mental health services in an effort to prevent crime from happening at all. “People commit crimes out of poverty, mental health issues, desperation,”he says, acknowledging that white people,“especially white women feel unsafe about defunding the police but what we’re saying is put the money back into community organizations.” While the idea of completely wiping out crime merely by putting money into education and mental health issues may seem radical, Newsome says America is an“experiment”ready for“change”and he compares the perceived extreme nature of the Defund the Police movement to the innovations of Apple founder Steve Jobs, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos,“or even Albert Einstein.” “You’re always crazy until you’re right.” While Newsome is no fan of the president, he did acknowledge that Trump’s administration has tackled issues related to black struggles in America, including“mass incarceration,”which Trump has attempted to reform through efforts like the First Step Act, which makes it easier for non-violent criminals to be released from prison. By tackling“mass incarceration”but not supporting the Defund the Police movement, the administration, he claims, is“addressing an issue and denying it at the same time.”  Like this story?

"19 Jun, 2020 17:03",It’s absurd to feel guilty about 200yo crimes while ignoring the West’s recent destruction of Iraq and Libya,"By focusing on the historical crimes of Western imperialism, we are in danger of forgetting that some terrible wrongs were done more recently in US-led ‘regime-change’ operations for which no one has yet apologized. is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 We live in strange times. Ordinary people are being encouraged, some would say gaslighted, to feel guilty over bad things done by Western powers hundreds of years ago, over which not even their great grandparents had any control. Yet at the same time they are expected to ignore or forget about equally awful things which happened in living memory. The dominant hegemonic narrative has it that exploitative ‘imperialism’ – and the attitudes of racial superiority that went with it – ended with the demise of the old European empires. But that is absurd. Arguably an even worse form of it has emerged in recent decades, one which has caused an enormous amount of death and destruction around the world. Yet while the ‘old’ imperialism and anyone associated with it is completely beyond the pale, the new turbo-charged, ‘politically correct’ imperialism, which often masquerades under a ‘progressive’ or ‘humanitarian’ banner, gets off very lightly. Consider what has happened these past 30 years. In 2003, Iraq, already targeted for years with draconian sanctions which caused great harm to the civilian population, including the death of many children, was subject to an all-out military assault on the fraudulent grounds that its leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction which could be assembled and launched within 45 minutes. Result: Iraq was destroyed. Hundreds of thousands died during or following the invasion. The chaos caused by ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom’ led directly to the rise of the death cult IS/Daesh. As if that wasn’t bad enough, in 2011 more or less the same was done to Libya. The country with the highest Human Development Index in the whole of Africa in 2009 was bombed back to the Stone Age by the NATO ‘human rights’ crusaders. The pretext for the assault was that Muammar Gaddafi was about to slaughter the inhabitants of Benghazi. But five years later, after the country lay in ruins, the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee report held that ‘the proposition that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered the massacre of civilians in Benghazi was not supported by the available evidence.’ Just like Iraqi WMDs. In 2017, it emerged that black Africans were being sold at slavemarketsin ‘liberated’ Libya for as little as $400. Almost the entire British political and media class – including virtue-signaling Labour MPs now‘taking the knee’to protest against racism – supported the bombing of Libya, a regime-change op which was marked on the ground by racist pogroms against black Africans by NATO-backed ‘rebels.’ You don’t have to be Einstein to spot the double standards. After Libya came another imperialist regime-change op in Syria, which entailed once again the sponsoring of violent extremists, and British involvement in the war in Yemen – described by UNICEF as the largest humanitariancrisisin the world. Surely we should feel more strongly about these operations than those which took place centuries ago? Yet we don’t. Ask yourself this question: If/when neocon warmonger John Bolton, who supported – and indeed cheer-led for – the above ‘interventions’ comes to Oxford University to speak about his new book attacking Donald Trump, would there be more, or less, demonstrators than for the ‘Rhodes Must Go’ statue protest last week? Or if David Cameron, who led Britain into Libya in 2011 and wanted to bomb Syria in 2013, came to give a talk? To make it clear: this is not about absolving Cecil Rhodes. My wife and I visited the Kimberley Mine Museum in South Africa a few years ago and we were appalled about the way the indigenous black people were treated by the utterly ruthless individuals who made vast fortunes out of Africa’s mineral resources. But isn’t it strange that a statue of a man who died 120 years ago gets people more worked up than those still alive, who have played key roles in today’s blood-stained imperial projects and who have never said ‘sorry’ for the misery they caused? If you’re being cynical, you could say it’s far better for today’s power elites that we do indeed focus on historical figures in funny old clothes from centuries past who did bad things, than those following in their footsteps today. Because if we did concentrate more on current imperialism, the power elites might actually lose their power. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"11 Jun, 2020 20:35","JK Rowling’s sexual-abuse revelation is timed to deflect from her ‘transphobia’ – and, by #MeToo logic, it should’ve worked","Had the Harry Potter author opened up about her experience of historical sex abuse and domestic violence before, she’d surely have won widespread support. Does the silence she’s received now mark the death of the #MeToo movement? ByJason O’Toole, author of several best-selling books who has worked as a senior feature writer for the Irish Daily Mail, a columnist with the Irish Sunday Mirror and senior editor of Hot Press magazine. I certainly wouldn’t do JK Rowling the great disservice of comparing her recent actions to pen such a confessional essay to that of the sleazy actor Kevin Spacey coming out as gay in a desperate and very crass attempt to shift the narrative of his sordid scandal. Nevertheless, I’ve no doubt that Rowling intentionally revealed it in an effort to seek sympathy and put a stop to the ongoing backlash she’s being on the end of, thanks to her contentious comments on gender identity earlier this week, when she was denounced as being “anti-trans” for posting atweetmocking an article that referred to “people who menstruate” rather than “women”. ‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud? Opinion: Creating a more equal post-COVID-19 world for people who menstruatehttps://t.co/cVpZxG7gaA “A lie is a lie,” as the Haim sisters sing on the opening track of their superb new album, due for release at the end of this month, which I’m coincidentally listening to right this second as I type this up. And no matter how she attempts to spin it, Rowling told a big whopper in her controversial 3,600-word transgender essay when shewrote, “I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy.” Really? That’s total BS. After 20-odd years in the limelight, she is certainly not naïve enough to believe that dropping some sensational bombshells out of the blue like this wouldn’t garner huge media coverage, because it obviously would and did. It was splashed across the front pages of several UK papers on Thursday, with the Daily Mail running with theheadline, “My domestic abuse and sex assault hell by JK Rowling.” Come on, JK! We all know it was done solely in a vain attempt to distract the irate keyboard warriors and hopefully give everybody a guilt trip. It’s the oldest trick in the book called the Dark Art of Spin, and it’s disingenuous of you to claim otherwise. But whether I’m right and she tried to invoke them on purpose or not, this was where #MeToo was supposed to kick in. However, in her case, there was just silence… followed by another round of online ire as she faced“a fierce backlash” on social media. The questionable pity-me tactic “backfired” on her, as the Daily Mirrorputit. You wouldn’t need to be Einstein to see the online attacks restarting, but I was taken aback by the eerie silence of the once-powerful #MeToo movement. Why have they failed to come out in support of Rowling in her hour of need? It would’ve been unthinkable two years ago for a celebrity to step out of the shadows like this without them being hailed by #MeToo – never mind suffering any criticism for doing so without facing their great ire. With Tara Reade’s recentclaimsagainst Joe Biden being met with a wall of silence, it was already starting to become clear that the liberals and their media supporters were conveniently forgetting their once strongly held view of “believe all women” – an axiom even once uttered by the US presidential candidate himself. But the lack of response from the #MeToo crowd about Rowling brings into question whether or not this movement that radically shook things up is now, once and for all, officially dead. It certainly looks like it, because #MeToo was most definitely on its last legs when the actress Rose McGowan recently tweeted her unease about Biden’s nomination and nobody batted an eyelid. That, it seems, was its death rattle – and Rowling’s statement was the final nail in its coffin, it appears. There’s no disputing that the #MeToo movement was a hugely significant moment with some notable scalps, like the repulsive Harvey Weinstein, getting his just deserts. But I’ve always been very uneasy with alleged rapists being publicly named on social media without proper due process taking place first. Even Samantha Geimer, who has been known all her life simply as “The Girl”, after she was raped at the age of 13 by the film director Roman Polanski, once told me herself that even she had concerns about #MeToo. During an in-depth interview in May 2018 that lasted well over three hours, Samanthasaid: “I don’t really think it should be used to take down celebrities. We’re trying to get equal wages and equal rights, and to end a society where sexual harassment is tolerated. So, I feel trying to take out Woody Allen or Roman Polanski or James Franco, it’s like, ‘Hey! Focus! We’re trying to make the world better for women, and being mean to celebrities – that’s not it…’ Listening to everybody who wants to say, ‘Al Franken touched my waist’. OK, just stop! Let’s move forward. If it just turns into a weapon to use against celebrities and politicians, then that’s pretty sad. I think all this celebrity-bashing is a distraction, and it’s not really nice.” READ MORE:TERF war: How a tweet from JK Rowling exposed the militant intolerance of the trans lobby Geimer also agreed with me that victims should exhaust all legal channels, rather than making a song and dance about it all on social media. “Go to court – otherwise don’t be accusing people of things and expecting dire consequences when you’ve never bothered to prove it. That sounds kind of s****y – I’m sorry. We’re having #MeToo now, so every single celebrity is going to have a bunch of people talk about stuff they did 20 and 30 years ago. OK, it’s probably true – I don’t know. But who’s this helping?” She added: “I don’t think #MeToo should be a weapon. We should be strong, moving forward, stopping abusive treatment. If you’re using it as a weapon to take people out, over stuff that happened maybe a while back or a long time back, I don’t see the value in that. #MeToo is not supposed to be a weapon. I feel that it’s getting used that way by people and it bothers me.” You could say that she was, in fact, the first high-profile #MeToo rape victim – the reluctant “poster child,” for lack of a more tasteful description – which certain adds weight to her words. As she told me herself, “It wasn’t #metoo. It was like #justus. It was a lot harder to be all by yourself than it is to have a hashtag and a bunch of celebrities into it.” As I say, I applaud any victim of sexual abuse to go public with their story – yet I wonder if Rowling has lost some of her dignity here by playing the victim. She would’ve been better served by keeping her powder dry, so to speak, and accepting the criticism. That way, she could have told the world about her abuse at a more appropriate time and then there would never have been any question about her true motives for sharing it. As it is, judging from the reaction on social media, she has lost a lot of people’s respect. It’s a crying shame, because those Harry Potter books won’t have the same magic now for many fans. They’re deeply unhappy about the controversial views she shared in both her recent tweets and the essay itself, which is a can of worms in itself, and best tackled in a separate analysis. As the old adage goes, there’s a time and a place for everything – and clearly this wasn’t the appropriate moment for Rowling to pour her heart out. I bet she’s wishing she had a magic wand to make this all disappear. Seeing as she has a propensity for putting her foot in her mouth, perhaps she should just stay away from Twitter. Like this story?

"11 Jun, 2020 12:39",ISS astronauts create FIFTH STATE OF MATTER in space for first time ever,"Astronauts on board the International Space Station have created a rare state of matter in ways not possible here on Earth. ByElliot Leavy, former editor of the technology and innovation magazine maize and editor of culture magazine BOZO. He has written for numerous publications around the world focussing on technology, belief systems, and culture. A new studypublishedin the magazine Nature suggests that scientists have used a small facility called the Cold Atom Lab (CAL) to create rare Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), also known as the fifth state of matter. The CAL is capable of chilling atoms in a vacuum down to temperatures one 10-billionth of a degree above absolute zero – lower than in interstellar space. That’s why CAL – the size of a bedside table – has a reputation for being one of the coldest spots in the known universe. BECs occur when the temperature of an ensemble of atoms almost reaches zero. These gaseous clouds of atoms then act collectively, rather than individually. First predicted by Albert Einstein and Indian mathematician and physicist Satyendra Nath Bose 95 years ago, they weren’t observed in a lab until 1995. The reason why it was essential to make BECs in space is that, on Earth, gravity pulls them to the ground, making them disappear within fractions of a second. When created in the microgravity of space, however, BECs last longer – the atoms slow down and their wavelengths align, allowing us to study them for longer. “It was recognized early on that microgravity would come in handy, and that going to space would give us a lot of advantages in terms of measurement time,”David Aveline, the lead author of the study and a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab,toldBusiness Insider. In the past, scientists have conducted some pretty rudimentary tests to achieve microgravity here on Earth – including using a specially constructed tower at the University of Bremen’s Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity, where researchers drop objects from tall heights to simulate the state. With the CAL, BECs can be generated“amazingly quickly,”Maike Lachmann, who participated in the experiment,toldGerman magazine Welt der Physik (World of Physics). This is because with the CAL,“you don’t have to cool large bodies, just a tiny atomic cloud,”meaning the entire process takes roughly two seconds. The success of the CAL experiment could mark the first step in BECs becoming the basis of ultra-sensitive instruments that can detect the faintest signals from the most unknown aspects of our universe, such as gravitational waves and dark energy. Aveline alsotoldMIT that BECs have more practical applications, which“range from accelerometers and seismometers to gyroscopes.” Whatever the outcome of the study, the existence of CAL means that scientists can continue to get funky with how they experiment with atoms.

"7 Jun, 2020 06:26",On Contact: Trump & the ‘permanent lie’,"Chris Hedges talks to Mark Green, former New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner and Public Advocate, about the""permanent lie""used by US President Donald Trump to cancel out reality. Mark Green is co-author, with Ralph Nader, of""Fake President: Decoding Trump's gaslighting, corruption, and general bullsh*t."" YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook.com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/on-contact  CH:  Welcome to “On Contact.” Today, we discuss the nature of the permanent lie with author Mark Green. MG: Another 20% did vote for him, traditional Republican, so if he can convince them that black is white or white is black according to how they are paid, to quote Jonathan Swift, he’s gotten it. So he doesn’t care about blue states, doesn’t care about you or me, doesn’t care about reality. So he will repeat and repeat a permanent lie, as Goebbels knew so well, as Mussolini knew so well. A permanent big lie to people who are 5-second voters--“Oh, yeah, that sounds good,” and then they go back to what they’re doing—enables him to overwhelm their love of family or their love of truth, because they believe Trump, even though the air is dirtier, the water is dirtier, the rich are getting epically richer while they in real dollar are getting poorer. They don’t understand that because they grab onto the life preserver of the permanent lie. CH:  Donald Trump, like all demagogues, engages in the permanent lie. The permanent lie is different from the falsehoods and half-truths uttered by politicians such as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The common political lie these politicians employed was not designed to cancel out reality. It was a form of manipulation. Clinton—when he signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement promised “NAFTA means jobs, American jobs, and good-paying American jobs.” George W. Bush justified the invasion of Iraq because Saddam Hussein supposedly possessed weapons of mass destruction. But Clinton did not continue to pretend that NAFTA was beneficial to the working class, when reality proved otherwise. Bush did not pretend that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction once none were found. The permanent lie, however, is not circumscribed by reality. It is perpetuated even in the face of overwhelming evidence that discredits it. It is irrational. The iron refusal by those engage in the permanent lie to acknowledge reality, no matter how transparent reality becomes, creates a collective psychosis. As Hannah Erendt wrote, “The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we are taking our bearings in the real world—and  the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end—is being destroyed.” Joining me to discuss the nature of the permanent lie and its danger to democracy is Mark Green, the former New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner and New York City public advocate, who, with Ralph Nader, wrote “Fake President: Decoding Trump’s Gaslighting, Corruption, and General Bullcrap.” I’m gonna substitute “Bullcrap” for the word you wrote, Mark. So you quite interestingly lay out the mechanics of the permanent lie at the beginning of the book, you know, how that permanent lie works, and I kind of just want to go through them. Let’s start with what you call the “Black Swan” fallacy or “Cherry Picking.” This phenomena of you write of spotting a black swan and then implying that all swans are black, what’s this about? MG: Well, we have massive evidence against you. You have to search for one example. So Trump’s lied 18,000+times, according to the “Washington Post.” And all he has to do is say, “Oh, once Bill Clinton—once Barack Obama—this is true—said there were 57 states, so who are you to tell me that I don’t tell the truth?” Now, Obama said that late in the campaign trail. He knows there aren’t 57 states. And Obama’s a standard politician. He may puff, exaggerate to make his point, but he doesn’t, as you say, have a permanent lie that’s the crux of his candidacy or his presidency. And that’s a very good phrase. Thank you for it. We’ll steal it, as we will. It’s sort of like “Fake President.” That is, he is President, according to the 1787 Connecticut Compromise, which overweighted slave southern state in the electoral vote, and here we are 240 years later. He loses the popular vote, becomes President. But he’s fake in that he can’t tell the truth. He can’t do the job. Job is to console people during a pandemic. It’s too [audio cuts out]. It’s like if you asked me to high-jump 8 feet. I can high-jump 3 feet. I just couldn’t do it. He can’t do it because it’s so ingrained that he is a self-centered, narcissistic, malicious guy that everything goes through that prism. So, Chris, we don’t know each other well or not, but you’re—I’m almost scared to be on with you, with someone as smart as Nader. I usually don’t do that, but I’m making an exception for you. Someone says to me or you “The sky is blue.” We may look at it and see the sky is blue or red. We want empirical reinforcement. He doesn’t care. All he cares about is being the David Blaine, a master hypnotist, to about 25% of Americans are the fringe fourth. That’s an estimate that’s true of all Western society. People who are racist or ignorant believe “Well, slavery was good for the black people.” And there’s no—they’re irredeemable. Another 20% did vote for him traditional Republican, so if he can convince them that black is white or white is black according to how they are paid, to quote Jonathan Swift, he’s gotten it. So he doesn’t care about blue states, doesn’t care about you or me, doesn’t care about reality. So he will repeat and repeat a permanent lie, as Goebbels knew so well, as Mussolini knew so well. A permanent big lie to people who are 5-second voters--“Oh, yeah, that sounds good,” and then they go back to what they’re doing—enables him to overwhelm their love of family or their love of truth, because they believe Trump, even though the air is dirtier, the water is dirtier, the rich are getting epically richer while they in real dollar are getting poorer. They don’t understand that because they grab onto the life preserver of the permanent lie. CH:  But we should—you know, the power of the permanent lie is that it’s emotionally appealing, which is why people who engage in the permanent lie, as Trump does, will frequently contradict themselves, often within a 24-hour period. I want to just keep going through your kind of anatomy of the permanent lie. “Assertions & Adjectives.” Explain that idea. MG: Well, the current press secretary does this all the time. Instead of evidence, like, “Oh, you say that voting by mail is inherently fraudulent.  It could be fraudulent. Nothing is perfect. We drive cars, and we know there’s a .00001% chance we’ll die, but what’s your basis for that?” And she and Trump have no evidence, so they say, “It’s well-known that it’s a total fraud on voters in our democracy.” Really?  And so Trump keeps saying, “Our performance has been great in the pandemic.” And then he’ll find “Oh, look, there was once a scenario out of a British epidemiologist that said if I don’t do anything, there’ll be 2.2 million people dying.” And let’s say that’s true. So that’s the black sheep. You take one example, you exaggerate it, you then self-proclaim… Muhammad Ali was the greatest, but Trump says, “I’m the greatest. I’m a success. I’m a great success.” And isn’t it easier to attach a fabulous adjective to you and what you’re saying than having to do what’s called scholarship—you know an article, footnotes. And a lot of people will believe the adjective rather than the fact. CH:  You talk about performance art as part of this permanent lie. You have that great quote by Ronald Reagan. “If you can fake sincerity, you’ve got it made.” Talk about the nature of performance art as integral to the permanent lie. MG: Well, it’s hard to know who the real Donald Trump is. By the way, I know him personally pretty well. I ran for mayor of New York City at a time where I was favored to win. So he gave me money, not because he loves me. He’s a transactional guy. And he now has adopted—of course, he adopted—Reagan adopted a persona as an actor. We get that. He adopted a persona as a tough, brilliant boss in “The Apprentice.” We get that. Now when he’s in public, his…his body language, his head nodding, his fake sincerity… “Black people—what do they have to lose?” His voice goes up. It’s a performance meant to dupe the credulous. And I find myself sometimes when he says something, I go, “Oh, really?” And then I remember, “Oh, wait a second. Mark, you who co-wrote ‘The Fake President’ with Ralph Nader, you’re a sucker.” For an instant, we all go for the visual sincerity. “If you can fake sincerity, you’ve got it made.” And so, I couldn’t tell you when he says the 20th time, “I wrote the law that gave our military big pay increases.” Now 20 times, the “Washington Post” and Mr. Dale of the “Toronto Star” have said, “That’s a lie.” Obama wrote and signed the law that gave the military pay increases. So when he says that the 20th time after being told it’s a lie, is he insane? Is he pathological? Has he convinced himself? Or is he saying “What do I care what this … reporter says? I got a mic that’s a million times bigger. I’m just gonna say it.” So he’s performing for us, and it convinces a lot of people. CH:  Thanks. We’ll stop there, and we’ll come back after the break with Mark Green, the author of “Fake President” with Ralph Nader. [Break] CH: Welcome back to “On Contact.” We continue our discussion of “Fake President:” with author Mark Green. So let’s move on to the next category of the permanent lie, which you call “the insult machine.” This is a daily phenomena for Trump. What is its role in the permanent lie? MG: Well, he has a few approaches. We had in our book 21 tricks, like a magician has a trick, so you can spot when he’s doing it. And they all add up to lie, deny, blame, and berate. And like, “I’m as good as Tiger Woods in basketball.” He’s a greater athlete, but—so he’s great at golf, obviously, but it doesn’t transfer. Trump is a genius at instantly deploy—so he’s at a press conference answering questions. And whatever anybody says, he has the skill, having done this thousands of times--whether it’s real or not, doesn’t matter—to immediately “Oh, that didn’t happen.” “Oh, that’s not true.” “Oh, blame Carter.” “Oh, Nancy Pelosi is mentally unstable.” The “New York Times” did an aggregation of all these, and there are 500 people that he’s personally denounced with the megaphone, of course, of the White House ‘cause of our habit, and it’s really creating a problem, that when a President says something, that “Today’s a day of infamy” or “Voting by mail is fraudulent,” whether it’s true or not, it’s news ‘cause it comes out of his mouth. And so it’s hard to get around that because of his repetitive untruths. Oh, one second. You had also [audio cuts out] insult. You had asked about insults, forgive me. So… CH:  Yeah. MG: There are limits. Suppose he tweeted “Mark Green is overrated.” Could be true, could not be true. Who cares? When he doesn’t like Joe and Mika on “Inside Joe—“ “Coffee Joe in the Morning:” on MSNBC— CH:  “Morning Joe.” MG: When he says of Mika and Joe on “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, not “they’re overrated,” “they’re pretty,” “they’re not pretty,” but he says, implies, “Joe committed murder decades ago of a young woman in his office with whom he may have had an affair.” Now, if I said, “Donald Trump is a polygamist and a pervert who does men,” people would be outraged. I would have as much credibility—and I would be chased out of the public square for slander. He does that all the time, in effect. He crossed the line—crossed the line. He crosses every line. When he wakes up in the morning, he’s crossed the line. And when he said of “Morning Joe” that he—“Some people say he commits murder…” Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney said, “You’ve crossed the line. Cut it out.” And we’ll see, since he—part of his performance art is never apologize, which is odd. Who among us is perfect? But when you never apologize, you don’t learn. So if he makes a mistake—who doesn’t?—early on, he should have had earlier testing and masks. He said, “You know, the CDC, they don’t come better.” For months, he said, “You don’t need a mask. You know, they know more than I do, than you do. Now they say everyone should wear a mask to protect you from them and them from you. That was a mistake, and we’re gonna do better.” If you’re unteachable and you’re ignorant and you refuse to admit error, then there’s only one way he or society goes, and that’s downhill. And for 3 years, we’ve barely survived his willful lying or his self-delusion. Psychiatrists can figure out which. We’re now at a point where in our book, we said before the pandemic, you know, he wants to lie about his golf score, what the hell. But if he lies about life-and-death decisions, this country’s health and democracy will be at risk ‘cause who will believe him? Well, here we are now 100,000 deaths later, and Eugene Jerecki among others has posted an analysis that the best epidemiology experts have said that 2/3 of the 100,000 deaths would have been avoided if Trump had listened to the experts in February and March when he did nothing. When, if he reacted better, according to the scientific evidence, said, “Gee, we made a mistake,” 65,000 people who are not listening to us would be alive. Trump, by policy, murdered them. And so I tell you, I—I—yes. CH:  I want— MG: Go ahead. CH:  I just want to move on. I mean, the one aspect—the thing about the insults is that it’s a form of dehumanization. I mean, you know, you look back on dictatorships of the past, and it’s a way—not only are you destroying the credibility of the person who’s attacking you, you are denying them their own humanity, as he did with the disabled “New York Times” reporter. But I just want to move on. You talk about the—you did, I think, mention about the unscientific method, but you also, you and Ralph, have this category called “upside-downism—no, you’re the puppet.” Explain what that is. MG: Well, we use the phrase “projection”--I don’t know if that’s the right psychological phrase--where if you’re Willie Sutton, you go, “Me? 20 people out there are the bank robbers, not me.” And so, he’s constantly saying, Pelosi, et. al, “They’re liars,” “They’re mentally unstable.” Black reporters, 4 times in a month—female black reporters he said are “stupid.” He has an inferiority complex that he overcompensates big-time. And so when he says something critical about a person, it’s often to preempt an attack on him for the same thing.  And so, “Oh, you’re blaming me for the pandemic? Obama left the cupboard bare when it came to masks and testing.” Well, whether he did or not, I couldn’t tell you, but that was 3 years ago. And he ignored Obama’s transition team laying out a way to fight pandemics. So he’ll blame someone else for what he does, and it’s a rhetorical trick. And in terms of dehumanizing people, as you just said, to use an extreme but glowingly scary analogy, when Hitler said, “Oh, he said that, but he’s a Jew.” And people go, “Oh, well, we can’t believe Einstein.” And so when he disdains African-American people--all reporters are enemies of the state, a phrase from Stalin, he admitted it once. Give him credit. He can’t control his bragging. He said to Lesley Stahl off-camera on CBS after a “60 Minutes” interview—Lesley said, “Enough with the fake news. It’s ridiculous, it’s belittling, and it’s not true.” He said, “No, no. You don’t get it, Les—When I say it, I so delegitimize all media critics that I can always say—and he does—any criticism is “Oh, that’s the fake media.” And that’s like a dog whistle to the listener saying, “Oh, I don’t have to listen to that anymore.” And it works, not with everybody, but  we’ll see. It worked with 46% of Americans that got him slightly through the graduating the electoral college. We’ll see if he can do it, not when Trump brags about how he’ll do something. He now has a record of doing bad things. CH:  Let me go on to--it’s “Fear” itself. Talk about that, that, you know, how fear is deployed in such a way as to solidify the kind of permanent lie. MG: Well, we’ve seen it over centuries by Rome fearing Greece or Mussolini fearing the West. It’s hobgoblins. And so we live through it, people of our age, the Soviets. They appeared to be in iconography and imagery 10 feet tall, they could beat us at nuclear war, they can beat us at conventional war, and all you had to do—of course, during  the McCarthy era—is say someone’s a commie, and their life was ruined. Well, now Trump tries to do that with any critic. And so he’ll say, “If you elect Joe Biden, we’re gonna go back to…” and then he fills in a word--a “depression,”  forget that we’re closing in on one, or “big government eating you up.” And so the only thing he wants people to fear are Democrats or minorities or blue states. And some people who are insecure in their lives psychologically or economically, they may grab on to this as people would believe Elmer Gantry. CH:  You talk about nicknames, but I think that we’ve covered that with insults. But I want to talk. You have a section called the “Hyperbolic & The Apocalyptic,” especially the “Apocalyptic.” Talk about that ideas, again, a kind of foundational concept for the permanent lie. MG: Well, that’s simply fearing something. But speaking of apocalyptic, he said that if he hadn’t been elected in 2016—I’m closely paraphrasing—we would be having a nuclear war with North Korea. Now, can I disprove that? You can’t disprove a non-event. By the way, we’ve avoided nuclear war with North Korea since they were at nuclear capacity, what, 15 years? But he simply says that. Now, there are people—I saw a woman who was asked why she wasn’t testing herself for COVID-19. And she said to the reporter, “I don’t have to. I’m bathed in Jesus’ blood.” Whether I believe that is true or not is not relevant. People can have any religious belief they want, but language like that leads people like that to believe in the Rapture and…in a coming Armageddon, according to some religious book. And how do they unlearn that? So this is not simply exaggeration. You may not like Nancy Pelosi’s policies. Is she mentally unstable? Ha! I wish more of us were that mentally unstable. And it’s a form of denigration where you don’t have to answer her criticism. Now, she tries to criticize Trump on the merits, but every so often, I’m delighted. She goes, “Well, I don’t want to really talk about how he’s ignoring the health of old, overweight people, and he is morbidly obese.” Ha ha! It’s true. But normally, you don’t engage in these 5-year-old insults, but what are you gonna do when Trump… CH:  Well, at that point, Trump wins because you’ve brought it right down into the gutter at his level. I’m running out of time, so I want to get one of your last points about “Political Correctness.” MG: Well, when you—by the way, political correctness exists and it—on both sides. But conservatives now use it as a way to imply that someone is not saying what he or she believes, but is saying it because of a…the masses, the wisdom of crowds. And so, this week, when a reporter asked him a question at a White House press conference and was wearing a mask, Trump said, “You can take it off. I want to hear you.” He said, “No, I want to be safe.” And then Trump said, “Oh, you’re being politically correct.” So that’s, again, like denigrating a black female reporter or minorities. He’s using a phrase that has no content. Now, in fact, the reporter’s not allowed to do this. You or I could have said, “You’re an idiot. I’m following the guidelines of your own CDC. Why are you viol—why aren’t you wearing a mask?” So, again, it’s a trick that works with people who are 5-minute or 5-second voters. He has leaps of logic that people have a hard time penetrating when they’re said in a—by someone who’s a speed liar. CH:  Well, I think, you know, as we—and you alluded to it—as we enter an economic dislocation that could very well rival the depression of the 1930s, people who engage in the permanent lie, which is really about emotionally catering to the distress of a public become increasingly effective, which is why we saw demagogues arise in the 1930s and why we’ve seen one arise out of our own failed democracy. But we’ll have to stop there. Thank you very much, Mark Green.

"22 May, 2020 08:32","Scientists in Brazil make faster, cheaper RNA coronavirus test that doesn’t produce false negatives","Researchers in Brazil have announced a quicker, more accurate coronavirus test than the existing method, allowing them to assess more people at once. The test has already been patented in the US and will be available from June. Scientists at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo used Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), which identifies a particular disease by reading fragments of DNA. They adapted the NGS test to detect ribonucleic acid (RNA), the predominant molecule in viruses like SARS-CoV-2. “The virus has RNA and our research group was interested in knowing how a molecular test could be used in the context of this pandemic,”said Claudio Terra, the hospital’s director of innovation and digital transformation. The NGS test is as precise as the conventional RT-PCR method used around the world, but it has the major advantage of allowing for over 1,500 tests to be carried out simultaneously – a 16-fold increase in processing volume. The current tests, known as serological tests, focus on checking for antibodies produced by the human body to fight the infection. However, they can only work some 14 days after the initial infection, a lead time which in turn leads to a higher number of false negatives (up to 30 percent). The RNA tests detect coronavirus infection from the first day and provide results within three days, after the tests are administered via injection or oral swab. The Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein’s labs conducted 150,000 exams in a 72-hour period, up from an initial 2,000 tests per day. Pathologist Joao Renato Rebello Pinho, coordinator of the Einstein Special Techniques Laboratory, said their main concern was“dramatically increasing”Covid-19 testing capacity at a“more accessible”cost. Widespread testing using this methodology will begin across Brazil in June and will be shared around the world shortly after. The patent has already been registered through the International Patent System in the United States and will also be made available there from June. Think your friends would be interested?

"28 Apr, 2020 09:31",Universe may actually have a ‘north’ and a ‘south’ as new tests tear holes in Einstein’s gravity theory,"Scientists studying a quasar 13 billion light years away believe they have discovered a ‘direction’ to the universe which, if proven true, would upend not only Einstein’s theory of gravity, but the standard model of cosmology. The universe is governed by four fundamental forces which stitch it together: gravity, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force and electromagnetism. As it turns out, the fundamental physical constant to measure electromagnetism between charged particles is actually surprisingly inconsistent, despite being responsible for tying electrons to nuclei inside atoms and keeping pretty much everything from falling apart. That’s according to researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, who used images and data from the Very Large Telescope in Chile to measure this force back in the first billion years of the universe. The results have caused the team to question whether there may actually be a ‘Goldilocks’ effect, or a perfect balance between these fundamental forces, which is required for life to exist at all. “Putting all the data together, electromagnetism seems to gradually increase the further we look, while towards the opposite direction, it gradually decreases,”says astrophysicist John Webb from the UNSW, adding that, in other directions in the cosmos, the fine structure constant which governs electromagnetism remains the same, indicating some form of directionality. Their new readings, combined with data gleaned from separate studies, indicate variations in this ‘constant’, which may (once again) upend our current and hard-fought understanding of the universe around us. In other words, the universe may once have had a ‘north’ and a ‘south’, or definitive points based on these variations in the electromagnetic constant. “[The new study] seems to be supporting this idea that there could be a directionality in the universe, which is very weird indeed,”Webb says, which implies that the universe may not actually be the same, in a statistical sense, in all directions. The team’s findings were also supported by separate, and largely unrelated, research in the US by a team who found similar ‘directionality’ among x-rays. It is still too early to talk about the full implications of the research, but it may force those working on the Grand Unified Theory, the hunt for a singular unifying force in the universe that ties all the others together, to rethink everything. Throwing an additional spanner in the works is the possible existence of a fifth fundamental force, according to research published last year. Indeed, our standard model of cosmology is based on an isotropic universe (one which is the same in all directions). This model, in turn, is based on Einstein's theory of gravity which, you guessed it, assumes that the laws of nature are constant. In other words, we might have to rethink large sections of our physics and our understanding of the universe around us, and come up with entirely new (though exciting) replacements if this new research turns out to be true. “...It's something you've got to test because it's possible we do live in a weird universe,” Webb says.

"20 Apr, 2020 16:05",Breathtaking VIDEO recreates enormous smash-up between two black holes,"A colossal collision of two black holes 2.4 billion light years away was detected by astronomers last year, but fresh developments show that the reverberations – both figurative and literal – have been felt ever since. The galactic smash was not between two equally sized black holes, as initially thought, but was instead the violent coming together of one black hole weighing in at 29.7 solar masses and another weighing just 8.4 solar masses – a bit of a mismatch, by anyone's calculations. A new video below shows the discrepancy in weight class between these two gravitational giants. As it turns out, despite the enormous combined masses involved, the collision marked the lowest-mass black hole collision humanity has ever detected – but even so, it affords the Earthbound scientific community vast troves of data to pore over for years to come. “This observation lets us test our predictions for gravitational wave signals in a new way, and is another piece in the puzzle of understanding how binary black holes form,”said astronomer Christopher Berry of Northwestern University. Among the bizarre and haunting noises produced by the collision were two distinct frequencies that were, rather amazingly, an interval of five notes apart – or, in music parlance, a perfect fifth (think the first two notes of 'Twinkle Twinkle'). The team were able to use these frequencies generated by the collision to once again test Einstein's theory of general relativity, while also determining that the larger of the two black holes was indeed spinning – something hitherto achieved only twice before.

"16 Apr, 2020 10:17",Star proves Einstein’s theory as it orbits supermassive black hole in stunning ‘SPIROGRAPH’ pattern (VIDEO),"Observations of the star S2, which orbits a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, show that not only does it prove predictions made by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, it does so in spectacular fashion. Using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have been tracking S2’s orbit around the black hole Sagittarius A* since the 1990s. After poring over the data from the observations, the researchers have now concluded that S2's orbit isn't a fixed-in-position ellipse but instead shifts position like a spirograph drawing, as illustrated in this incredible animation. The ‘spirograph’ phenomenon is known as Schwarzschild precession, and S2 has now proven that such celestial oddities hold true even in the most extreme gravitational environment in the universe. S2 comes within 17 light-hours of the black hole or roughly four times the distance between Neptune and the sun and, in doing so, reaches speeds of up to three percent the speed of light as it is swung around by the black hole's immense gravity. In addition, the observations of S2's movement around the black hole also confirmed Sagittarius A*'s mass as being around four million times that of the sun, further confirming previous predictions while also setting limits on the amount of invisible material, such as dark matter or even smaller black holes, that could possibly be orbiting the gaping black hole at the heart of our galaxy.

"5 Apr, 2020 16:52","Magic bullet for Covid-19? Scientists look to century-old plasma treatment, but there are some big ‘BUTS’","As the world seeks a Covid-19 panacea, treating patients with plasma harvested from those who have recovered from the virus is being touted as a possible cure – but big challenges still remain, scientists say. It's been months since the novel coronavirus started to rage across China, spilling over to other countries and infecting more than a million people around the world, but there is still no clinically tested vaccine or medication. However, one possible treatment that has been around for over a century is attracting attention, with some scientists suggesting it could be a game-changer – provided that certain flaws are removed. The approach basically revolves around harvesting convalescent plasma, the yellowish liquid component of human blood, from someone who recovered from a viral infection and transfusing it to a newly infected patient. Plasma is essential here because it is rich in antibodies – proteins that bind to parts of the virus and neutralize it. Remarkably, antibodies are produced against specific types of viruses, effectively becoming an""anti-virus serum,""Aleksey Kupryashov, head of blood transfusion at Bakulev Center of Cardiovascular Surgery, explained to RT. The idea behind the therapy is very straightforward – sharing antibodies taken from patients with a robust immune system could help other, weaker ones to recover. Conceptualized by German physiologist Emil von Behring – the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine – the method has actually been around for over a century. Just recently, in mid-March, Arturo Casadevall of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and Liise-anne Pirofski of the Albert Einstein Medical College championed the treatment, claiming infusions of antibodies could potentially protect people from the virus for several weeks. Later in the same month, their Chinese colleagues suggested that convalescent plasma had helped Covid-19 patients even on ventilation, but their study was based on only five cases. As health workers used to say in the Hippocratic Oath, doing no harm is key in medicine. Can we be sure that treating Covid-19 patients with antibody-packed plasma will do no harm? ""We transfuse hundreds of thousands [or] millions of blood units in hospitals, and the severe outcomes are really low,""Professor Jeff Bailey of the US-based Brown University told RT. The logic behind using plasma against Covid-19 is""very strong""because""a person who has recovered has good antibodies that will block and neutralize the virus,""he explained. However, one big issue is that""it's a new disease, we haven't transfused a lot."" Another concern that may arise is that every 200 or 400 milliliters of transfused plasma expands the patient's blood stream. This will present no problem if the patient's kidneys work well, but if they don't, the volume could increase fluid in their lungs, worsening the condition. But will the therapy work for everyone, given that there are no compelling statistics showing whether the plasma transfusion is efficient against the Covid-19? ""You have to try it, only experimenting can tell us yes or no,""argued Sergey Netesov, a leading virologist and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. At any rate, trying experimental therapy is better than""dying on the spot without any medication."" Physicians on the front line urgently need trials to study the benefits of plasma treatment as new drugs are being developed, Bailey agreed. What you want to know is if this helps survival [by] 50 percent and something else helps survival [by] 25 percent, you probably want to go with the one that's 50 percent. Dr Charles Rupprecht of the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ross University said “there is no magic bullet”in the absence of peer-reviewed, large-scale, long-term, double-blinded studies proving the benefits of plasma in Covid-19 treatment. The scientist, who leads the rabies section at his institution, referred to that disease as an example. Rabies immune globulin (RIG) – which also contains large amounts of antibodies from donated blood – is“one critical part of prevention after humans have been exposed to a rabid animal,”but it’s“short-acting”and is usually used in a healthy patient before“illness onset.” Still, no specific coronavirus treatment has been proven to be effective, so doctors and patients need“the tincture of time,""as there are always safety issues to consider in the use of human blood products, he cautioned.  However, the hardest part here is finding and vetting donors, the number of which is appallingly small, especially compared to more than one million coronavirus cases globally. Also, plasma intended for Covid-19 patients must be free from other diseases, such as hepatitis or HIV/AIDS. ""As a matter of fact, up to 50 percent of donor blood is being rejected in most countries,""Netesov revealed, citing the example of China – a pioneer in plasma treatment – where almost one-in-10 potential donors had hepatitis. Russia, for instance, has only a tiny number of recovered Covid-19 patients, and maybe only half of them could donate blood, limiting the pool to mere dozens, the scientist acknowledged. ""The number of patients is still larger than the number of the recovered. As long as this situation persists, we have nobody to take that plasma from,""Kupryashov of the Bakulev Center agreed. Finding the right dosage of plasma is equally crucial under the circumstances, because doctors have to know what concentration of antibodies is enough to help cope with the virus. In the long run, however, manufacturers will usually process plasma, increasing the amount of antibodies and allowing doctors to use smaller doses, Bailey said. Health authorities around the world have high hopes for plasma treatment, rapidly rolling out trials and authorizing it for compassionate use – allowing unapproved treatments to be prescribed if a dying patient has no other options, and if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. In the US, where the number of coronavirus cases has now exceeded 312,000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded""a new national effort""to facilitate the use of plasma treatment.""There are some limited data to suggest that convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin may have benefit in the Covid-19 illness,""the agency states. The Mayo Clinic will serve as the lead institution for the program, while the American Red Cross will collect plasma and distribute it to hospitals throughout the country. In the UK, coronavirus patients are about to receive the experimental treatment, with experts calling on the NHS to urgently stockpile antibody-rich plasma for such needs. France is also set to start trials for the promising therapy next Tuesday. Russia, too, is catching up with the trend. The country's famed Sklifosovsky Institute of Emergency Care will be the first to try infusing plasma in the coming days, local media have reported. Additionally, the Vector Institute – a leading research center of virology and biotechnology – has developed a test for measuring antibodies in those who have survived Covid-19. The institution has already screened blood samples from 11 people who recovered from the virus, Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said. Iran, recently a coronavirus hotspot, will also follow suit, as will Turkey, where the head of the Red Crescent insists that it could become""one of the world's most effective applications""against the contagion. For the time being, many other treatment options are being considered by the international healthcare community, ranging from anti-malarial drugs to HIV medication. A range of Covid-19 vaccines are also being developed, although they seem to be months – if not years – away from being commissioned. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"1 Apr, 2020 09:19",What will 6 months of Covid-19 do to our society? Only certain thing is we'll be in a state... and the STATE will be IN CONTROL,"Predicting the future is always notoriously difficult. The unprecedented response to the Covid-19 crisis means most bets are off on what may happen, apart from reinforcing the idea there is no alternative to state intervention. is a writer, speaker and consultant on innovation and technology, was most recently a Director at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he set up and led their crowdsourced innovation service. Follow him on Twitter@Norm_Lewis is a writer, speaker and consultant on innovation and technology, was most recently a Director at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he set up and led their crowdsourced innovation service. Follow him on Twitter@Norm_Lewis Albert Einstein famously quipped that he never thought about the future because it came soon enough. He might have been a genius, but he didn’t experience the coronavirus crisis – and thus could not imagine a time when society would be so obsessed with thinking about the future. There are a number of difficulties with trying to anticipate what society might be like after this crisis. In the first instance, we have no idea how long this will go on. Experts disagree. Some suggest lockdowns could be relaxed in three months. The UK government is now planning on at least six months. In each case, the outcomes could be significantly different. Second, whatever happens in the future we can be sure there will be continuities and disruptions, and destructive and constructive dynamics at play. Crises are never one-way streets. But – and this is critical – the coronavirus crisis will not bring year zero, a new era or clean slate in which what happened in the past will disappear or can be ignored. Nor will pandemics be the new normal. The exceptional peacetime actions taken by governments and central banks, and the reorganisation of society and the economy around lockdowns – which is inducing some behavioural changes – are temporary, not permanent. But the consequences, particularly of the unprecedented global state bailout which the Financial Times estimates to be around$4.5tn, will have a direct bearing on the future and in different ways. The increased role of the state in the economy and society is the one definite in a sea of uncertainty. In the UK the government has promised loans and grants to businesses worth £330bn, and basic pay for company employees who are left workless. The Treasury is propping up wage support, grants, tax holidays and loan guarantees. It has relaxed banking regulations to ensure lenders can provide £190 billion of extra credit, and the authorities are using moral suasion to conscript them into the Covid ‘war effort’ and back small businesses. Even despite this, it is estimated that at least a fifth of small businesses will collapse. With echoes of a wartime command economy, ministers are coordinating supermarkets to distribute food and manufacturers to make ventilators. This might evoke wartime parallels, but the analogy is inapt. Why? Because in real global wars, capital is destroyed and forced to restructure, which creates the conditions for renewed growth. The post-war boom demonstrated this all too clearly in the 20th century. In the coronavirus ‘war’, however, state spending and mobilisation are geared towards propping up pre-existing stagnation. And this is what is being studiously ignored in the many fantasies being suggested as heralding the future. Claims that this crisis is forcing traditional business to embrace the digitalage, for example, are merely highlighting how vacuous the claims made by many are that we have been in a new fast-moving age of disruption and innovation. The fact that some old-line industries – from media and entertainment through retail to food and beverages – are having to go online to survive the lockdown highlights how stagnant, not innovative, so much of our economy has been, and remains. The idea, too, that people working from home represents the future world of work is another make-believe forecast. While this may appeal to doomsday environmentalists – less commuting means less congestion, less pollution and lower CO2 – the real issue is what work they might be doing, rather than the fact that it is at home. Is it productive or decorative? The so-called coronavirus war has revealed another less-acknowledged reality of the stagnant economy: namely that many essential jobs in our society are unskilled or semi-skilled, and that we depend more on these than the much-hyped white collar ‘information’ or service workers. How much difference would it make if many of the latter jobs simply disappeared? But the absence of construction, agricultural, transport, delivery, and indeed health workers, to name a few, brings home the fact that even in the ‘digital age’, we depend upon material production in sectors that have suffered decades of stagnation, non-investment and non-innovation. Even some highlights of the current crisis, like‘Project Pitlane’– the collaboration of seven F1 engineering teams based in England to rapidly develop a continuous positive airway pressure breathing device – should not be over-hyped. Without diminishing the accomplishment, we should soberly reflect on the fact that the best of British engineering has re-engineered an existing off-patent device, not created a breakthrough in health care. ‘Project Pitlane’ speaks to something quite critical about the future. The immediate crisis has made the world unfamiliar. But yesterday’s ideas have not disappeared. Wokeness, identity politics, inter-generational conflicts, and the culture of low expectations, will be back with a vengeance. More importantly, the risk-averse culture of precaution around climate change in particular will be larger than life. Why? Because what people have seen in the behaviour of the state – particularly the disbanding of the rule book of fiscal responsibility – will raise the obvious question:“If all this is what was necessary to deal with Covid-19, what about the climate emergency?”After all, Covid-19 accomplished what Greta and Extinction Rebellion were advocating: shut down schools, stop flights, stop people driving cars, reduce our carbon footprints, stop fossil fuel exploitation, etc. And this is surely the point about the future. While the economic consequences are going to be felt for generations to come, the more immediate effect will be its political impact. What Covid-19 has already accomplished is the final nail in the coffin of the phoney post-war ideological battle between free-marketeers and state ‘socialists’. Already the banners flying in society have inscribed“There is no alternative to the State,”following Margaret Thatcher’s famous dictum ‘There is no alternative to the market’ after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. When Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, jokingly quipped in theFinancial Timesthat“if the government said it was nationalising all the UK’s shoe shops, people would regard it as entirely plausible,”he was not exaggerating. There has been no argument. There has been no political debate. But the state has won, and everything else will follow. If we thought yesterday’s tendency towards technocracy was strong, we haven’t seen anything yet. The authoritarian trends already on display in the current lockdown are perhaps a harbinger of a future society run along managerial principles. But crises are never one-way streets. The examples of social solidarity we have seen suggest there are other forces at play that may positively influence the future. This remains an unknown. But the renewal of the role of the state is not. We do not need to speculate about its future; it has already arrived. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"13 Mar, 2020 15:49","Liberal ideology & virtue signaling put before people’s HEALTH, as Macron, Merkel defend open borders amid Covid-19 spread","Dealing with Covid-19, Emmanuel Macron seems to be singing from the same hymn sheet as Angela Merkel, who is also against closing borders, but is this not a case of Western liberal ideology overriding necessity and common sense? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Compare and contrast. In his speech to the nation last night, Macron declared: “This virus has no passport.” He added: “We will undoubtedly take measures to close borders, but only when it is relevant… It is at the European level that we have built our freedoms.” Macron is closing all schools, nurseries, universities and day care centres from next week and has called on the vulnerable to isolate themselves. But if anyone can still come into France unchecked from countries where coronavirus is even more of a problem, won’t those measures be undermined? Ditto Germany. Angela Merkelsaidthis week that “we in Germany, in any case, are of the opinion that border closures are not an appropriate response to the challenge.” Contrast this ‘open borders,’ ‘we must protect Schengen’ approach with that of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Hungary who are all EU member states. Declaring a 30-day ‘state of emergency,’ theCzechgovernment has closed its borders to people from 15 countries hit by coronavirus and banned its citizens from visiting these countries too. From Monday next week, all international travel to and from Czechia will be essentially prohibited. Slovakia is closing its borders today to all foreigners except those who have a residency permit, while announcing that all Slovaks who have been abroad will have to face two weeks of quarantine. Austria has barred all people entering the country from Italy, unless they have a medical certificate. Hungary has banned arrivals from Italy, China and Iran. But in Western Europe, it seems a commitment to maintaining ‘open borders,’ even at a time of a potentially very extreme health crisis, trumps other concerns. An example of this fundamentalist and very dogmatic approach can be seen in the tweet from Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt who declared: “Nationalism isn’t the answer to COV19, because viruses don’t care about borders or nationalities.” Nationalism isn't the answer to#COVID19, because viruses don't care about borders or nationalities. We are all in this together. We need a European approach to save lives & bold interventions to protect our economy.pic.twitter.com/T5g9ua0Qfv But on the most basic medical level such a statement from Verhofstadt is just downright silly – even by his standards of silliness. Of course viruses don’t care about borders or nationalities – and can potentially infect anyone – but when said virus is more prevalent in some countries of the world than others, it makes sense to restrict or ban entry to people from those worst-affected countries to minimize the chances of the disease spreading. This is not a question of being pro- or anti-immigration (for the record I’m generally pro); this is about common sense at a time of emergency. Consider the strict quarantine measuresintroducedby Hong Kong for travelers from mainland China and the case of Vietnam. As soon as the virus began tospreadin late January, Vietnam partially closed its borders with China (as well as closing schools), and stopped issuing visas for Chinese tourists. As a result, the country only had 16 cases of coronavirus and all the patients recovered. However, a few days ago the number of cases jumped to 35, following the re-introduction of the virus from a flight from Britain, with the ministry saying that most of the 13 passengers who tested positive were British or Vietnamese people who had traveled to other parts of Europe, including Italy. International travel may broaden the mind, but unfortunately, it also helps Covid-19 to spread. You really don’t have to be Albert Einstein to understand that the more open the borders, the greater chance of a country seeing its coronavirus cases rise. Yet the most powerful countries in the EU – unlike the more pragmatic ones in central and eastern Europe – seem to be putting virtue signaling and liberal ideology first. Of course, there’s a moral case that can be made for ‘free movement,’ but in a time of crisis, governments have to forget all that and put protecting their own citizens first. Nationalism? No, it’s just doing what governments are elected to do. If we can criticize Macron and Merkel on these grounds, we can criticize Boris Johnson too. Plane loads of people arriving from the worst affected areas of Italy have been arriving in Britain without any proper checks. On last night’s BBC Question Time, Professor John Ashton, a former director of public health, noted how around 3,000 supporters of the Spanish football team Atletico Madrid were in Liverpool this week for a Champions League tie. Spain’s Corona cases, as of Wednesday, had surpassed 1,600 with about half of them in theMadridregion. Two-thirds of Spain’s deaths from the virus have occurred in the Madrid region. Yet, as Professor Ashton pointed out, the Madrilenos would have been out and about in Liverpool on Tuesday and Wednesday, drinking in bars, staying in hotels, traveling on public transport. How can governments say they are doing everything they can to stop the spread of coronavirus when unrestricted travel from Covid-19 ‘hotspots’ is still taking place? It may be true, as Macron says, that “It is at the European level that we have built our freedoms,” but what price ‘freedom’ if it means the ‘freedom’ to die from coronavirus because the most logical, common sense step of all is not taken?

"4 Mar, 2020 10:38",Scientists believe new theory may finally shed light on DARK MATTER,"The universe has more mass than we can account for. A lot more. One of the greatest mysteries that has eluded scientists for decades is where all this mass comes from. One brand new theory suggests we may have cracked the case. We can only tell all this mass (which makes up the majority of the universe) is there by observing its gravitational effects on objects around it, for which we use the stand-in term 'dark matter.' Now physicists think they have identified one potential culprit that might explain the mysterious bending of light around stars and other massive objects, as well as the rotation of entire galactic discs, both at a higher rate than we can account for. As always, they have opted for catchiest of names: the subatomic particle known as a ‘d-star hexaquark’ or d*(2380), for short. The new theory goes that shortly after the Big Bang vast numbers of this d-star hexaquark might have come together to create dark matter. Dark matter neither absorbs, emits, nor reflects any kind of electromagnetic radiation, which renders us effectively blind to it, as these are precisely the factors we observe in the universe around us via probes and telescopes to figure it all out. Up to 85 percent of the universe may be made up of dark matter. If we can't prove it exists, that would mean a return to the drawing board, as our standard model of the universe would be fundamentally flawed, along with much of the theoretical physics at the edge of our current understanding. Not ideal. ""Our first calculations indicate that condensates of d-stars are a feasible new candidate for dark matter. This new result is particularly exciting since it doesn't require any concepts that are new to physics,""says nuclear physicist Daniel Watts of the University of York in the UK. Quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. They usually combine in threes to form baryons which make up most of the observable matter in the universe, like you, the screen you're reading this on and so on. However, when six quarks combine, they create a dibaryon or a hexaquark... we think, as we haven't actually seen any yet. These hexaquarks are Bosons, fundamental particles that obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Basically, they're the kind of thing we need vast, multi-billion dollar particle accelerators like the one at CERN to observe for even a split second. Given that scientists believe that hexaquarks behave this way, they likely form the mysterious fifth state of matter, called a Bose-Einstein condensate, formed when low density boson gas is cooled to just above absolute zero. Atoms in this state no longer move around like normal but become quite still, which almost never happens in the universe. So the latest theory proposes that, in the aftermath of the Big Bang, an unfathomably vast cloud of d-star hexaquarks was floating around and eventually cooled to form these Bose-Einstein condensates, providing the vast majority of the mass in the universe, while simultaneously boggling the minds of theoretical physicists and researchers for the past century or so. The team behind the latest theory are planning to hunt for these d-star hexaquarks in both the lab and in outer space to either prove or disprove their new theory — science can be maddening like that. ""The next step to establish this new dark matter candidate will be to obtain a better understanding of how the d-stars interact — when do they attract and when do they repel each other,""said University of York physicist Mikhail Bashkanov. ""We are leading new measurements to create d-stars inside an atomic nucleus and see if their properties are different to when they are in free space."" Think your friends would be interested?

"28 Feb, 2020 18:22",Eureka! Physicists accidentally stumble upon mind-blowing new material that could upend physics as we know it,"American physicists believe that they have discovered a strange state of matter entirely new to science – and they did it all completely by accident. Peter Andrewsis an Irish science journalist and writer, based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in Genetics Famously, many of the greatest scientific discoveries have been accidental. Alexander Fleming let bread go moldy and discovered penicillin. Archimedes splashing about in the bath stumbled upon how to measure the volume of a solid. It’s perhaps an indictment of the modern world’s overly-regimented and bureaucratic scientific community that such unintentional breakthroughs never seem to happen anymore. Western university-industrial complexes are burdened with never-ending paperwork, and huge resources devoted to ethical and health and safety requirements. These modern innovations have their benefits, of course, but they do have a major downside, in that they completely smother the more spontaneous side of the scientific method. But now, a team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, have made an exciting and accidentaldiscoveryin the often-overlooked field of materials science. This team has previously made several leaps forward in the world of materials science by stacking ultra-thin 2D layers on top of each other to form new structures. These sheets are only a couple of atoms thick – so thin, in fact, that the electrons within them are restricted to movement in just two dimensions (hence their name ‘2D materials’). Such materials are too small to see even with the use of microscopes. Swastik Kar, an associate professor of physics at Northeastern University and one of the co-authors of the study,describesthe new discovery as""a perfectly repeatable array of pure electronic puddles""in between the two ultra-thin layers. The rules of quantum physics make it energetically favorable for the electrons to pool into these predictable patterns, despite the fact that they should repel each other due to their negative charge. “It’s almost like a new phase of matter, because it’s just purely electronic,”Kar added. On the potential applications of the discovery, Kar said that“when such phenomena are discovered, imagination is the limit.”When he first saw the way the material was behaving, he was convinced it must be a mistake, but says the team’s discovery could have major implications in communications, storing information, and a raft of possibilities“we may not have even thought of yet.” Moving electrons around is the essence of all electrical technology, from solar panels to spark plugs, and iPhones to Xboxes. The potential applications of a breakthrough like this are too extensive to list, but one wonders if larger questions might be addressed by seeing particles behave in unexpected ways such as this. A trend is now beginning for some of the biggest scientific breakthroughs to emerge on the frontier of materials science, and specifically nanotechnology. By investigating the nanoscale, right down to the level of individual particles like electrons and protons, strange properties begin to emerge – properties that do not seem to make sense in the context of a rigid Newtonian universe. For over a century, many of the world’s greatest minds have been trying to marry the two great theories of physics, Newtonian (or Standard Model) and quantum. The search for a Grand Unified Theory, or Theory of Everything, obsessed Einstein, Hawking and many others besides. Could materials science be the unlikely battleground where the answers will finally be revealed? We will have to wait and see, but until then, we’re likely in line for some sleeker smartphones, not to mention faster computer speeds. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"31 Jan, 2020 17:10",Astronomers spot two-star system spinning so fast it’s BENDING space & time (VIDEO),"Astrophysicists spend their time working on some truly mind-bending stuff but after two decades of observations, scientists have witnessed a pair of stars spinning so fast they literally bend both space and time. The team has been tracking the orbit of the extraordinary binary star for about 20 years, using the CSIRO Parkes Observatory’s 64-metre radio telescope. The researchers, from the ARC Centre of Excellence of Gravitational Wave Discovery, caught the spinning celestial bodies“frame-dragging”or, in other words, twisting both space and time with their immense gravity. Astronomers spot two-star system spinning so fast it’s BENDING space & timeMORE:https://t.co/JKadR04U5Cpic.twitter.com/KdnBltL0A9  The research, published Friday in the journalScience, is yet more evidence for Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The binary star is made up of two stars. One is a white dwarf, a star whose nuclear fuel has run out, which is roughly the size of the Earth but has 300,000 times its density. The other is a neutron star which is somehow about 100 billion times the density of the Earth while only measuring approximately 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) in diameter. All that matter is compressed into a star system with the catchy name“PSR J1141-6545.” We can witness frame-dragging to a tiny degree by observing gyroscopes here on Earth, however it takes an extremely long time, one degree every 100,000 years or so, but because the effect is around 100 million times as strong in the binary pair the scientists were able to spot it despite the fact that it is several hundred quadrillion kilometers away. In case you think that’s a made up number, a quadrillion is equal to a million billion. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"10 Jan, 2020 07:34",There are parallel universes out there populated by our parallel twins - Michio Kaku,"Today's theoretical physics sounds like ancient magic, but it’s looking forward, daring to imagine endless possibilities. What are they and when will the theories on the edge of progress change our lives? We’ve talked about this with brilliant physicist, father of the string theory - Michio Kaku. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Dr. Michio Kaku, thank you very much for being with us today on this programme. It's a great pleasure. So lots to talk about because for us, you're one of the greatest minds of our times. What I think about it, every day there are new gadgets, there are small scale discoveries. But then again, for years, there hasn't been a major breakthrough in physics that would help us in general understanding of how the world works. What does it really mean? Does it mean that we've reached a borderline of what a man can actually discover about the physics of the world? Michio Kaku:No, I think that we're just beginning to probe the mysteries of the universe. The Nobel Prize was given recently for the discovery of gravity waves, and we hope to put gravity wave detectors in outer space, a new kind of telescope, a gravity telescope. Think about it! All telescopes today use light. Now we use radio to peer into black holes. Next will be gravity telescopes that will allow us to peer inside a black hole at the instant of creation itself. And so we're going to begin a new realm of astronomy with gravity wave detectors, starting with the discovery just made a few years ago. SS:Can you explain to me about this Nobel Prize, and physicists who got it because there’re discoveries of gravity waves, what does it mean? Can we actually control gravity? Are we getting closer to controlling gravity? I mean, I have my personal interests. MK:No, we cannot control gravity, but we can measure it and harness it and probe some of the deepest secrets of nature itself. SS:What would that give us as humans on earth? MK:First of all, we'll begin to understand where it all came from, how the universe was created. People ask the question, “Well, if there was an explosion at the beginning of time, where did the explosion come from? What was the universe like before Genesis?” Well, we physicists believe that the universe is a bubble of some sort. It's expanding. That's the Big Bang theory. However, we think there are other bubbles up there, other bubble universes, a multiverse of universes. So instead of just one soap bubble universe is expanding, we live in a soap bubble, a bubble bath, a bubble bath of universes. And when these bubbles collide, we think that could be the big bang. So this cosmic expansion that took place at the beginning of time may have taken place because of the collision of universes or perhaps the fissioning of a universe into two smaller universes. And so we're going to put into outer space a gravity wave telescope, perhaps in a few decades, that will allow us to peer into the instant of creation. We're going to get baby pictures of the infant universe as it emerges from the womb. And maybe we will find evidence of an umbilical cord. An umbilical cord connecting our infant universe to a mother universe. And perhaps that is the Big Bang. SS:But could we ever get closer to understanding and somehow controlling time if we have a better understanding of how gravity works? MK:Well, eventually, maybe millennia from now, we may have enough power to begin to think about building a time machine or building perhaps a space warp, just like you see in the movies... SS:I was going to ask you that. Is it is it really a pipe dream for people or is it a question of future? MK:It is a pipe dream for us because we're so primitive. However, maybe in outer space, aliens have already done this, but it would take the power of a black hole in order to rip the fabric of spacetime. Einstein's equations do allow for time machines, for example. Einstein said that time is a river. It's a river that speeds up and slows down. But it's a river that can fork into two roads or perhaps a river that can have whirlpools, whirlpools which would make time travel possible. Now, this is not for us, but I think in the far future, if we have enough energy, perhaps we'll be able to bend time into a pretzel and perhaps maybe even drill a hole through space and time. And that's called a wormhole. SS:Well, there have been many theories so far that are helping us better understand how the universe works. But you've contributed to one of the main ones. That is the string field theory. So the string field theory, if I understand correctly, in essence, is a theory that imagines the world made up of different strings of energy. So if I gather it correctly, does this mean that in some sense, in essence, we're nothing but string music? MK:That's right. We think that the variety of subatomic particles we have - hundreds of subatomic particles we get by smashing protons apart in Geneva, Switzerland, are nothing but musical notes on a tiny, tiny vibrating string. So this would be an electron. This would be a neutrino. That would be a quark. They're nothing but different vibrations of a tiny violin string. So what is physics? Physics is nothing but the harmonies you can create on vibrating strings. What is chemistry? Chemistry is the melodies. The melodies you can play on strings. What is the universe? The universe is a symphony of strings. And then what is the mind of God that Albert Einstein wrote about for the last 30 years of his life? The mind of God would be cosmic music. Cosmic music resonating throughout the universe. That would be, quote, “the mind of God” that Albert Einstein wrote about. SS:Is this why a lot of people actually say (I think Herman Hesse has it also in his book) that music is so much more than any other part of any other art, just because it's unexplainable how it works on souls of people, and you can just gather people and make them cry under a music and it doesn't need translation because it is what we are? MK:Think of all the paradigms of nature, which is the richest one? For example, some people think that maybe orbits are the paradigm of Mother Nature, but you cannot create too many solar systems with objects going around other objects. But think about music. Music has the richest set of complexities, and harmonies, and rhythms of all the paradigms of Mother Nature. Music is the one that is the most complex, the most sophisticated, and it's the medium that Mother Nature uses to create the diversity of protons, neutrons, quarks, neutrinos that make up our universe. And so we think that in some sense, the melodies of nature is  physics. SS:I want to talk to you about another very popular theory, which is the multiverse theory, and that's been very popular also in science fiction movies lately. What do you make of it? Does this mean that there are parallel realities to our reality? MK:Well, according to quantum mechanics, objects could exist in multiple realities. I'm speaking here in Moscow about quantum computers - computers that actually compute in parallel universes. You see, an electron, we think, is nothing but a dot that sits at a certain point. But the quantum theory says, “No! The electron could be in many places at the same time”. Now, that boggles the mind. But how is it possible that an electron can be in two places at the same time? Because the electron exists in a multiverse, a multiverse of parallel universes, and therefore that allows us, we think, to create a new kind of computer. That's why I'm here in Moscow to talk about this - a quantum computer that computes in parallel universes. SS:So is this the big breakthrough in physics that we start talking about from the beginning of this interview? MK:That's right. We no longer believe in a UNIverse. That is a one universe theory. We think that our universe can coexist with other universes. And we think that explains a lot of the mysteries of Mother Nature. For example, it looks as if our universe was tuned just right to allow for humans to exist. If the nuclear force were stronger, the Sun would have burnt out billions of years ago. If the nuclear force were weaker, the Sun would never have formed. And so the universe seems to be tuned just right to make humans. Now, does that mean that there's a God that created humans? Not necessarily. It means that there are other universes where the Sun never ignited, other universes where the Sun burnt out too quickly. We're lucky. We're lucky to live in a universe that is just right to allow for life. SS:So what you're saying would actually exclude an option of having multiple mes or multiple yous in different universes and parallel universe because the Sun never ignited there, or the Sun burnt out too quickly there? Am I right? MK:No. In some parallel universes there's no life because the Sun never ignited or the Sun burnt out too quickly. However, there are other universes that look just like ours, where we have twins of ourselves. When I look in the mirror, I realize that I'm not really seeing myself as I really am. When I look in a mirror, I see myself a billionth of a second ago because that's how long it takes for light to go from here to there and back. And I also realize that when I look in a mirror I'm seeing waves. Millions and millions of waves that look like me, but actually are not. And some of these waves go in different directions. So one day I'll decide to go to school, another day I’ll decide to go to the beach. It's the same me splitting apart into multiple universes. SS:So does this mean that there is a parallel universe where another me didn't commit the mistakes of my life in this universe? MK:That’s right. Or another universe where you made a lot more mistakes. And in this universe, you're fortunate enough to be here. SS:How do they interconnect? I mean, do my decisions in this life, in this universe affect what happens to me in a parallel universe? MK:For the most part, the answer is no. For the most part, we cannot enter another parallel universe. In other words, universes are vibrating, and they vibrate in unison. But these universes begin to separate with time, and therefore it's very difficult to enter a parallel universe because we're no longer vibrating at the same frequency as these other universes. And so in this room, there are the waves of dinosaurs, in this room there are the waves of aliens, the waves of all sorts of crazy things. The waves of a universe where people never existed. Except we're not vibrating at the same rate anymore. We’ve decohered from them, so we cannot talk to dinosaurs. In other words, they are probably dinosaurs in this room right now. It sounds crazy, right? But we're not vibrating at the same frequency as them. So we can't talk to them. We can't interact with them anymore. SS:There may not be this tangible way of connecting to me or to dinosaurs, but there must be something that connects us all. What is it? MK:That's right. There is a way. And at the subatomic level it’s called ‘entanglement’, where quantum computers compute in different universes. So the computer exists not in one universe, but in many universes simultaneously. And that's why it’s so powerful, it’s more powerful than a conventional computer which computes with zeros and ones, zeros and ones, because a quantum computer computes in multiple universes. Now, this may blow your mind. This sounds like science fiction, but hey, we call it physics. SS:Would that computer, quantum computer eventually, in, I don’t know, a hundred thousand years, allow me or you to break through this bubble - this universe - and actually meet me in the next bubble – a parallel universe? MK:It's conceivable. Very difficult. In fact, that's why quantum computers are so difficult to create, because we want to make all the electrons vibrate in unison. And when they decohere, that they split apart into two universes, then they no longer can compute anymore. And so, believe it or not, the future of civilization, all the computational power of a future civilization may depend upon computing in multiple universes. And so this is not science fiction anymore - the world economy could one day depend upon this. SS:You brought up quantum physics, talk to me about it, because it was too complicated for me to grasp all that it's about. There's one thing that I think I understand about it, and that is that a wave becomes a particle when observed, and when it is observed it's a wave of possibilities. So my friends, my mystic friends, what they gather out of it is that observations and the power of mind can actually shape the world around you. Basically, you think of something, and you visualise it, and that comes true. What do you make out of it? Is this how it works? MK:Well, the greatest paradox in all of science that really encapsulates what we're talking about is called the cat problem. The Schrodinger cat problem. If I put a cat in a box and connect the cat to a gun, and the gun is connected to uranium. Uranium is a quantum mechanical thing. It radiates radiation, quantum mechanically. It sets off the gun, which then kills the cat. So the question is, if you put everything in a box and you can't look at it, “Is the cat dead or alive?” Well, we physicists say that you have to write the wave of a dead cat and added to the wave of a live cat. The cat is neither dead nor alive, the cat exists simultaneously in two states, it’s a nether cat[SA3] . OK? Now you may say, “This is crazy. I mean, you physicists are lunatics”. But this cat could be an electron, and the electron can exist in two states at the same time. So if electrons can do it, why not cats? Now, the way that we physicists get around this is that the universe has split in half. In one half, there is a dead cat; in the other universe, there is a live cat. And that's how we explain the Schrodinger problem. The multiverse idea allows you to explain how cats can be both dead and alive simultaneously. Now, this means, by the way, that people who are dead in our universe could be alive in another universe. We can't talk to them because we are no longer vibrating at the same frequency. But it means that Elvis Presley could be alive in a parallel universe. SS:Would that bring up the whole dogma of soul and what happens to it after the body is dead here on earth? Does that somehow connect to what you are saying? MK:It somehow does, however a thousand years ago, philosophers believed in dualism. The soul and the body were separate. And when you die, this all went to Heaven and the body went to the earth. That's how it was for thousands of years. And then we have now neuroscience. Neuroscience says, “No, no, no, no. It's just the brain. The brain thinks there's a soul, but it's just neurons”. Now we're beginning to come back to the way it was a thousand years ago, because now we are thinking about digital consciousness, because it's possible to digitise everything known about you: your credit card transactions, your videotape, YouTube interviews, everything known about you can be digitalised. And when you die, your digital fingerprint lives forever. And we're going to get very good at this. In the future, we'll be able to digitise everything that is known about us. SS:I found something that you said fascinating and very interesting. You have said that your life's work is to take the laws of physics and summarise it into an equation that is one inch long, and that equation would be ‘the God of Einstein’. You said that, right? So does that mean that basically you are looking for God and is God an equation? MK:Well, we think that string theory, which summarises all known physical laws, can be summarised into an equation one inch long. That's my equation, that string field theory. Now, why don't we physicists win the Nobel Prize then? Because there's a problem. It turns out that we now believe that membranes can also exist with strings. So not just strings, but like little balls, beach balls. In fact, our universe could be a membrane of some sort. And that theory has not been put into its final form yet. But string theory, yes, string theory can be summarised into a one inch equation, which happens to be my equation. That's my contribution to string theory - to be able to summarise it into an equation one inch long. SS:But what struck me, what you said was the word ‘God’. ‘That would be the God of Einstein’. MK:No, Einstein said that he wants to read God's thoughts. These are his exact words. OK? He didn't necessarily say this equation created God or this equation was God. He said that this equation is God's thoughts. That's how he phrased it. So he evaded the question, “Which came first, God or the equation?” He did not say which came first. However, he did believe that there are two kinds of gods that we have to separate. The first kind of God is the personal God, the God that answers prayers, that God that smites the Philistines, the God of the Old Testament. He did not believe in that personal God. He believed in the God of Spinoza, the God of harmony, beauty, simplicity. The universe didn't have to be beautiful. Universe is gorgeous and simple. You can put all the laws of physics into one little equation. That is not an accident. So Einstein said that there is a God of physical law, not a personal God, that answers your prayers and smites the Philistines, but a God of the universe that gives us the physical laws. In other words, a lawgiver, is what Einstein said. SS:Is this your understanding of God as well? MK:That's my understanding of God. Now, where this equation came from, we don't know. We just know that once you have this equation and you solve it, you get electrons, and protons, and neutrinos, and Big Bangs, and Earths, and water, and people. SS:What comes first, in your opinion, equation or God? MK:I don't know. I think that's where we begin to have no words to describe which came first. Einstein would say probably that God came first, and God's thoughts are the equation. And therefore, in some sense, these are the thoughts that God created. SS:He also said once that with progress, the understanding of physics gets simpler and simpler. See, we have all these concepts: quantum physics, waves, particles, membranes, strings, black holes. I mean, it's hard enough to even start to understand one of those concepts. How is it getting simpler? MK:Well, you know, I have friends of mine who are getting PhDs in English literary criticism and they write PhD theses on Shakespeare and “what did he really mean when he said this?” And I said to myself, “English is getting more and more complicated. Every year, somebody writes another PhD thesis on James Joyce, or Hemingway, or Shakespeare!” So English is getting more complicated with time. Physics is getting simpler, and simpler, and simpler. The laws of electricity and magnetism, which makes this interview possible, is called Maxwell’s equations. Maxwell's equation is half an inch long. It's the divergence of the F tensor is zero. Then light comes right out of it. It turns out that Einstein’s equation for gravity is a little bit longer: gμν = 0. That's Einsteins famous equation. That makes possible black holes and Big Bangs. The quantum theory is messier. It's about a page long, but it can be summarised into string theory, which is, again, governed by my equation. And then you realise that physics is getting simpler and simpler. SS:You have pointed out paradox yourself that the equations get simpler, yet we humans here on earth in this reality tend to complicate things just the same as we complicated them a hundred, two hundred, ten thousand years ago. Why isn't life for us getting simpler and easier in understanding of how we should live if the laws of physics and how everything else works around us, like you said, is getting simpler? MK:Because the fundamental laws, we think, are very simple and pure at the beginning of time. But after the Big Bang took place, things became complex. The human brain, for example, is the most complex object in the known universe. In the whole universe, the galaxies of galaxies, we have not seen anything resembling the complexity of the human brain. And there is a hundred billion neurons there. Each neuron connected to 10,000 other neurons. There are trillions of thoughts that we, our brain is capable of, and because of this, it means that human interactions are extremely difficult. So the fundamental laws of atoms are simple, but how they create the human brain and how humans interact with other humans is extremely complicated. SS:I want to talk to you about another thing. There is a UK, Canadian and Italian study that has provided what researchers believe is the first observational evidence that our universe is basically just a vast and complex hologram. What that means in my terms is that everything we experience is projected at us from a border line, somewhere from there, from the universe. Is this what it means? MK:Well, string theory gives us as a byproduct the holographic universe. Now think of a hologram: a hologram is a two-dimensional, it’s flat like this. But when you shine a laser light, out comes a three-dimensional wavefront. So if your eyeball is sitting over here, you see three dimensions. This is how, for example, at Disneyworld and amusement parks, ghosts and all sorts of creatures come out in three dimensions. How is that possible? It's because it's a flat sheet of glass that has a hologram on it. You shine laser beams on the outside from the backside and out comes a three-dimensional image. We think our universe is three-dimensional because we have length, width and height. String theory says, “No. The universe is perhaps ten-, maybe eleven-dimensional. There are other dimensions out there that we cannot visualise”. Now, to see this, think of a child. I used to spend a lot of time in San Francisco looking at the fish swimming in a Japanese tea garden. The fish live in two dimensions. They can only swim left, right, forward, backward. The concept of up beyond the pond is totally alien to them. They cannot visualise the world of up. It's only a two dimensional pond. And then I said, “If there is a scientist fish there, the scientist fish would say, ‘Bah! Humbug. There's no third dimension. There's only two dimensions. Everybody knows this! The pond is the universe!’”. And then I imagine as a child grabbing one of these scientist fish, lifting the scientist fish into the world of up, what would he see? He would see three-dimensional beings moving without fins, a new law of physics; beings breathing without water, a new law of biology. And then I put the fish back in the pond in my dream and then I said, “How would he explain it to the other fish? ‘I was in a parallel universe! I left the universe! I saw creatures that can move in the third dimension!’ And the other fish would say, ‘You're crazy!’” Well, today we believe that we are the fish. We spend all our lives in three dimensions moving forward, backward, left, right, up, down, thinking that's all there is. What you see is what there is, nothing more. SS:So you’re hoping for someone to grab you out of the universe and like, “Hello! Look what's going on in here!”? MK:Well, it's conceivable that maybe one day somebody up there in another dimension, and another multiverse, and another bubble universe will come to our universe and grab us and say, “Look, look! There's a whole universe out there, a parallel universe in dimensions beyond the dimensions that that you'd know and love”. SS:Thank you so much, Dr. Kaku, it was fascinating talking to you. And we thank hotel Lotte Plaza in Moscow for allowing us to arrange this interview and make this happen. Thank you. MK:My pleasure.

"5 Nov, 2019 10:41","Thrown for a loop: Paradigm-shifting study claims universe is a closed ring, not flat","Astrophysicists are known for mind-bending theories that are often too difficult for mere mortals to understand but new research suggesting the universe is actually a closed loop really takes the cake… or, erm, the donut? An international team of astronomers led by Eleonora Di Valentino of Manchester University pored over a trove of data released last year by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite. Contrary to the popular belief that the universe is flat, Di Valentino and her team came to the conclusion that the universe is, in fact, a curved, closed and inflating sphere, in what she dubbed a“cosmological crisis”that warrants a“drastic rethinking of the current cosmological concordance model.” As with many things astrophysical, their theory stems from Einstein’s theory of relativity and, more specifically, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, wherein gravity bends the path of light. The clue for the curved universe cropped up when Di Valentino and her team analyzed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). CMB is the leftover Big Bang radiation that lingers between stars and galaxies which dates back to around 380,000 years after the universe as we know it came into being. It is the dim background light that would remain if you were to shut off all other light sources in the universe. The 2018 legacy data for the Planck satellite shows that this CMB is being lensed far more than it should be, according to current cosmological models, in an anomaly known as an ‘Alens.’ “A closed universe can provide a physical explanation for this effect, with the Planck cosmic microwave background spectra now preferring a positive curvature at more than the 99 percent confidence level,”they wrote. “Here, we further investigate the evidence for a closed universe from Planck, showing that positive curvature naturally explains the anomalous lensing amplitude.” However, as with most things in astrophysics and theoretical physics, it is not quite that simple. A curved universe theory may purport to confirm this one anomaly but basically everything else we know, have studied and analyzed about the shape of our universe confirms that our flat universe cosmological models are correct. For instance, there is also the small matter of the Hubble Constant, a great source of headaches and debate among the scientific community as no two measurements of the rate of expansion of the universe agree as things stand, so a curved universe would make things even more complicated. via GIPHY Dark energy research into the unknown energy driving this universal expansion also doesn’t sit well with the proposed new curved universe theory. A previous analysis of the 2018 Planck data also found evidence for a curved universe but, after looking at dark energy research and other datasets, astrophysicists George Efstathiou and Steven Gratton concluded that there was“strong evidence to support a spatially flat universe.” For now at least, it appears that the ‘closed loop’ universe theory has fallen flat but with ever-increasing datasets and more sophisticated research as time inexorably passes, we may one day know whether we all inhabit a giant donut-shaped universe or not.

"1 Nov, 2019 06:58",Luck doesn’t exist – psychologist,"Hoping, fantasizing, believing – all seemingly natural things for humans. But can we choose what we believe and why we believe in the first place? We asked Michael Shermer, a psychologist, science writer and founder of the Skeptic magazine. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Michael Shermer, welcome to the show. It's great to have you with us. Lots to talk about. You know, many psychologists, yourself including, say that believing in improbable things is innate for humans. So are illusions basically a necessary mechanism that sort of Mother Nature has provided us with, you know, to survive, be happy in reality, which is often dire. Michael Shermer:Yeah, I think that's right. Innate is a strong word, but what I mean by beliefs being, you know, naturally born inside of us is that are our inclination is to try to understand the world, connect A to B. That's called learning, association learning, whether it's like classical conditioning, like Pavlov's dog or operant conditioning, like Skinner's rats. It's connecting one thing to another in the environment to try to understand causality. All organisms do it. So my little thought experiment is: imagine you're a hominid on the plains of Africa three million years ago and you hear a rustle in the grass. Is it a dangerous predator? Or is it just the wind? Now, if you assume the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error, a false positive. You thought there was a real connection, there’s no connection. But no harm. You just kind of run away. But if you think the rustle in the grass is the wind. And it turns out it's a dangerous predator — you’re lunch, you've just been munched and taken out of the gene pool. So my argument is that we evolved the capacity to assume that all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators instead of just the wind. And therefore we tend to believe things that are not true just in case, because some of them are true and therefore believing weird things, by the way, this is called superstition or magical thinking, believing weird things like that is not a bug in the system. It's a feature that comes equipped in the software of our programing to try to connect things in the environment just in case there's a real connection. SS:All right. So you say believes are almost restraint by common sense. Just like a riding bit helps to harness an emotional horse, but this horse will, you know, still go wherever, if it wants. Are you saying that our emotional self will always take over that rational one? MS:Yes. Well, we are both rational and emotional. Reason is a tool that we use to try to understand how the world works. Emotions are also kind of a tool. It's a way of reasoning very quickly. So evolution designed our emotions to drive us to do things. So you don't have to calculate how many calories your body needs at any given day. You just feel hungry. So that emotion of hunger drives you to eat something, and then when you're satisfied, you've had enough, you no longer have that feeling. Or desire to be attracted to somebody else — this is an evolved trait that helps the species perpetuate itself. You have sex and children and so on, but no one calculates exactly why they're attracted to somebody else. You know the waist to hip ratio or the symmetry of their faces or the complexion of their skin. No one does those calculations. You just feel attracted to somebody. So in that sense, things, emotions like anger and jealousy and, you know, those sorts of things. They're a way of reasoning about the world very quickly. It's called rapid cognition. You just have an intuitive sense about something. And we're pretty good about this with people. For example, if you have a sense ‘like this person, I don't have a good feeling about him. I don't trust him. I don't know what it is. I just don't feel right about him’ or the situation you're in. Those are usually pretty accurate feelings that we have, but it's not it's not psychic power. It's a way of reasoning very rapidly about the environment. You're picking things up from the environment. You don't know what they are. I don't know what they are. But it's just a feeling you get. And that's actually a good trait that we have. SS:Well, OK. Let me take this a step further. Let's talk about what's real or not. At the end of the day, what we do decipher is real, right? Because many renowned physicists — I’ve talked to Michio Kaku, for instance. He's suggesting that everything that we think is real — it might just be an illusion. What do you think? MS:Yeah, I don't think that's correct at the level at which we live — that is the macro, physical world. What Michio is talking about there or Brian Cox, one of the physicists that study quantum physics, for example, they're talking about the subatomic particle.  And this is a very different world. It's the size of atoms. If you had like a tennis ball here as the nucleus of the atom, the electrons going around it, sort of the energy shield or field of the electrons going around it. These would be like blocks away from the little tennis ball here. It's mostly empty space. The atom is mostly empty space. So that's why people, some new age gurus, talk about, you know, this chair is completely empty or this is really empty space. Yeah. But not at the macro level. At the macro level, the atoms are so tightly bound that essentially this chair that I'm sitting in is not empty space. It's a solid thing. That's why I don't fall through it and have a little accident here. So at the macro level, it's not an illusion. What we see and feel is a fairly accurate portrait of reality. Now, there are some people that argue that, say, this problem of what's it like to be a bat? Like, I can't know what it's like to be a bat because I don't have sonar. This echolocation system and the big ol’ ears to pick up the sound, bouncing off objects, and the brain apparatus to process the sound information and so on. I can't know what it's like to be a bat, a bat can't know what it's like to be me. And so whatever, let's say a thing in the environment looks like to a bat. It probably doesn't look like that to me. We probably have very different images of what the world looks like, but there's still really, as I say, a wall here. And if the bat is flying toward it, it's going to move around the wall. And I see the wall or I feel the wall, the bat hears the wall. The sensory apparatus is different. The neural structure processing the sensory information is different between me and the bat. But there really are walls. There really are things that we have to navigate around in the world. So that part is not an illusion. That's reality. So I argue that we evolve sensors that give us a fairly accurate portrait of what the world is really like. And the best tool we have for understanding that world is science, because, subjectively, you and I may be wrong or distorted or suffering from illusions, but collectively we can get an accurate picture of the world. SS:OK, so what about creativity? How does creativity affect our ability to believe in things? Does that mean that the richer imagination we have, the more likely we are to believe weird stuff or not necessarily? MS:I think there's a relationship between this and the ‘Believing Brain’, I toyed with the idea that this relationship between, say, madness and creativity or that people who are very open to new ideas, they make connections across disciplines or new fields that you and I maybe wouldn't make, but that they're so open to new ideas, they also believe a lot of wacky ideas. So, for example, I know a lot of really smart people, Nobel Prize winners and so on, they believe the weirdest things. SS:Like what? MS:And in part, I sometimes wonder if it's like ‘9/11 was a conspiracy’ or that astrology works or that ESP is real. These kinds of things that most scientists and skeptics are skeptical of. They think there might be something to this. I talk in the ‘Believing Brain’ about Kary Mullis who won the Nobel Prize for his work in genetics. The PCR technique of taking a little snippet of DNA and then reproducing that. It's a very common technique now. Kary Mullis, super interesting, super smart, creative guy. He dreamt up this solution to this problem for which he won the Nobel Prize while he was surfing and smoking pot and just kind of having a creative moment out in nature you know Like you and I are not going to have that kind of experience. All right. Or Einstein has this dream of flying on a beam of light. Yeah, I woke. I don't have dreams like that. But that kind of openness and creativity might lead you to think, well, ‘all these other things are real’. Not all of them are real. Sometimes the creative ideas you come up with are just Bonzo. They're just crazy. They're the Cracker Jacks. They're not real. And so the rub here is to have a mind open enough to accept radical new creative ideas that no one else has thought of, that turn out to be right. But not so open minded that you believe every wacky idea that comes down the pike. And so, you know, when people say, well, you know, they laughed at Galileo, they laughed at the Wright brothers, you know, it's like ‘well, they laughed at the Marx Brothers’. Being laughed at doesn’t mean you're right. So for every Galileo, there's ten thousand other scientists who had creative new ideas and they were wrong. And I encounter these people all the time. They send me their letters every week of new theories that they have, most of which are completely incomprehensible. So it's not that being creative and having a new idea means you're right and you should win the Nobel Prize. Most new ideas, even in science, even by professional scientists, are not right. So just one final point. Yeah, go ahead. SS:Just because you brought up science, it's just really interesting, I want to ask you, because I've heard the idea that a pseudoscientific research usually precedes scientific revolution and people try to fill some gaps in existing picture of the world. And then the multiplicity of real and pseudoscientific research leads to the so-called paradigm shift. Do you think that we're actually on the verge of another scientific revolution if we look at it that way? MS:Well, it depends on the field. I mean, most fields in the sciences are fairly well set. That doesn't mean they're right. But so here's how it works. So you've mentioned the word paradigm. So a paradigm is this sort of collective body of knowledge that most of the people working in that field agree. This is pretty true. These are pretty solid, well-supported ideas. Then around the paradigm, you have these anomalies that don't quite fit. And what do you do with the anomalies? Well, you assign graduate students to figure out what the problem is or, you know, somebody has to try to work on that problem. Now, if it's true that there's enough of these anomalies that build up and you have a new theory that says ‘I can explain not only the anomalies, but all the core ideas, too’, then you might have a paradigm shift, you might have a brand new scientific theory that overthrows the past idea. But the problem is that most people who think they have a paradigm shift, a new idea, they don't. They've gone off the rails. They just think they do, but they don't. And so you never hear about these because they get thrown out fairly early on. They run experiments. They don't pass the tests or they don't even try to test their ideas. They just bounce them off, colleagues or friends. And they go nowhere. And there's a lot more of those than there are of the famous paradigm shifting ideas like so Einstein comes up with, you know, his theory of relativity that explains some of the things that Newton couldn't explain. But it's not that Newton was wrong. If you want to get a spacecraft to the moon, just Newtonian mechanics is pretty much all you need, or even to Mars. Now there's some fine tuning with some general relativity adjustments made, but not much. So it's not that Newton was wrong and Einstein was right, it’s that Einstein added to the Newtonian paradigm. And that's usually how it works in science. It's not that this the state idea we've held on for centuries is completely wrong and we need a whole new idea. You hear this a lot. Particularly by new agers who think they have a new idea, but usually they don't. So there is a reason science is so conservative and cautious is because we know that most new ideas people have are incorrect. SS:So talking about what's real and what's not. What about hope, which is in essence, a belief, expectation that things will play out well. Right. So is hope a worthless illusion as well? MS:Hope, I don't think is a worthless illusion at all. In a way, hope is a projection into the future of a past that can go in one direction that is more likely to lead to our survival and flourishing rather than in another direction that doesn’t. So people often described me as an optimist. I wrote this book called The Moral Arc about moral progress over the centuries, and I think we can document this in great detail. You know, the abolition of slavery, the abolition of torture, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, animal rights and so on. It's been remarkable how much moral progress we've made. But I'm not an optimist in the sense that was inevitable. I'm a realist. I think it can all go south. I mean, we have to work at that. That's kind of on a collective level. If you mean by hope also personally, I think it does make a difference in terms of how you interact with the world, about whether you're hopeful or not. In a way, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you're a pessimist, you're more likely to see the world in a negative way and then maybe that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. There's a famous study done on luck. You know, some people think they're lucky. Some people think they're unlucky. As it turns out… No, first of all, there's no such thing as luck that is, lottery numbers are not more or less likely to come out because you're lucky or unlucky. That doesn't exist. But if you self identify as a lucky person in a way, back to your question, you're hopeful that you're going to win the lottery or thing good things will happen to you, turns out that people that self identify as being lucky are also score higher in openness to experience and extroversion. So in other words, they're more likely to talk to people, try new things, go to new places, interact with new environments. And in that way, because they're open to experiences and they're extroverted and like to talk to other people, more good things are likely to come down their path and more opportunities for them to take advantage of. And then in hindsight, they look back and go ‘Boy, was I ever lucky. I went to that party. I met this person and we got married’ or ‘I met this person and got this job interview. And this changed my life. I had this career. I had a great family’, whatever. Unlucky people tend to be introverted and they score low in openness to experience. They don't like travel, they don't like new environments, they don't like to go to parties, they don't like to talk to people. So they're less likely to have opportunities that come their way. And then in hindsight, think ‘Boy, I was sure unlucky that I didn't have all these good things happen to me that you had happen to you’. That's not luck. It's in a way, a self-fulfilling prophecy. SS:OK. And what about dreams? Are dreams in that sense innocuous this flight of imagination or escape from reality? What do you make of dreams? MS:Dreams, yeah, dreams are super interesting. OK, so just bigger picture: we all have to sleep every night eight hours. You've got to get eight hours. Super important. A good portion of that eight hours is going to be spent in REM sleep. R-E-M — rapid eye movement sleep. This is sometimes called paradoxical sleep because your body is super relaxed and deeply asleep, but your brain all of a sudden becomes kind of active. When you wake people up in those states they go ’I was having a dream’. OK. So dreams are a kind of a waking state in the sleep in which your brain is mostly asleep, but a part of it is very active. Now, what is it dreaming about? Mostly it's just random firings. OK. There's a couple of kinds of dreams. That one kind of dream is just sort of rehearsing the day's events. And we think that has to do with laying down memory tracks. So you have short term memory and then you have long term memory and there's this in-between kind of memory. And that one kind of dream is to kind of rehearse the day's events and lay down memory tracks so that they're more permanent. They get shifted into long term memory. But a second kind of dream is where there's these kind of random firings between different areas of the brain. And you have kind of a general narrative storyteller — it’s in the left hemisphere — that kind of tries to string all those impulses together into a narrative story that makes sense. And so these are the kind of crazy dreams we have, like in the filmThe Wizard of Oz, where Dorothy has this fantastic dream of going to this world with witches and midgets and, you know, golden paths. And then you know the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow. And that turned out to be her uncles and family members. And at the end of the movie, she's saying ‘Oh boy, I had this incredible dream and Toto the dog was there and you were there and you were there and so on. That's the kind of dream that we have that we can't make sense of like ‘Boy, that was really weird’. OK. What does it mean? Nothing. It doesn't mean anything. Those are just random dreams. And then finally, there are the kind of dreams we've all had that are related to things you're anxious about. And so these are often frustrating dreams, like you're trying to run away from a threat and you can't run, you're going super slow or you show up at work or school, if you're a student, you know, naked or you don't have your homework assignment or you're missing this or that and you can't. It's just those are kind of reflective things where we're anxious about or worried about in the real world. So what you're thinking about as you fall asleep apparently does make a difference. So there's this new area of sort of trying to control your lucid dreams in which you, as you fall asleep, you think ‘I'm going to dream, I'm going to try to dream about this and maybe write it down or whatever’. And some people claim that they have success in determining what kind of dreams they have. I've never tried this. I think it's possible in the sense that what you're thinking about, just as you fall off into sleep, that may influence at least the initial dreams that you have. SS:OK. That's really interesting. So in the 80s, there was a psychologist, Thomas Lindauer, and he measured that an individual brain can store only one gigabyte of knowledge and my smartphone right now can store tens of times more information. That means that we have no idea about lots of things around us and to make, you know, decisions or form opinions about the things we don't know anything about, we have to rely on other people's opinions which are based on other people's opinions and so on and so forth. So, without the ability to get knowledge firsthand are we inevitably locked in this sort of trap of wrong judgments? MS:OK, there's a couple of things to unpack there. First of all, that first study you mentioned, this is almost surely related to this myth that we only use 10 percent of our brain. SS:Yes. MS:Or our brain can only store so much information and so on. Yeah. Now, most of that's not true. SS:How much do we use? MS:But your larger point is true. We use all of our brain. When you scan a subject's brain in an MRI, the whole thing is active. And so to measure somebody’s brain activity, you have to give them a specific task to do. Usually they have a little keyboard inside the scanner and they have to pick between A and B or this image or that image. That causes the blood to shift from one area to the other. The whole brain is active, you have to get it to be even more active. What portion of the brain? So we use all of our brain. But your larger point that I think is true, that is we are very limited in both processing speed and total memory capacity. Now, we don't know what the total capacity is because we're still understanding memory and whether things that are stored are still in there somewhere, and you can recall them or if they're gone forever, or if there's some in-between state. But that aside. Your more important point is that we do have technologies for storing more information and processing it externally, so this is called the extended mind and your cell phone is one, your family members and friends, your community, your society, the entire media, the entire Internet is another place to store information and process information, that you don't have to rely on just your brain. So one theory about how humans became as dominant a species around the globe as we have is that we're very social and that we have the capacity to exchange information through symbolic language, through communication, initially, just verbally, but then through writing. This has given us an edge over all other species. They can't do this no matter how smart they are. They do not have the capacity to share that information in the kind of detail that we can at such an extent. This idea of wisdom that older people are wise, this actually has a good point in it in as much as before there was writing, elders stored that information from that kind of community memory going back multiple generations. So as you're young and coming up, you rely on your grandparents or the great-grandparents or the elders in the community to tell you what it was like 50 years ago when the glacier was there and now it's not there anymore, or whatever you're worried about. That's a kind of stored information that you can't have in your brain that other people can have and we can share that. And, you know, you talked about paradigm shifts earlier. If there's any paradigm shift we're going through now, it's in communicating knowledge and information in real time at the speed of light in which, you know, soon every single person on the planet, all seven and a half billion of us, will have access to all the world's knowledge instantly for free. That is never been the case in human history. That is, some people call it the singularity. Something big is happening right now that we have access to. Now, of course, there's a downside. You spend, you know, eight hours a day staring at the screen. Not good for your eyes, not good for your brain, not good for your social life. So there's a downside of that. But as a tool, you know, it's a game changer for sure. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"25 Oct, 2019 06:56",We all use quantum mechanics but can’t agree on what it means – physicist,"The last century was marked by mesmerizing scientific breakthroughs. But have we come closer to understanding how the world around us functions? We talked to physicist, humanist, popular science author and broadcaster Jim Al-Khalili. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Jim Al-Khalili, thank you very much for being with us today. It's been a while we wanted to do this interview with you, actually. Jim Al-Khalili:Oh, thank you. SS:Because you're a man who fits perfectly the formula that I live by. I think genius is very simple, and you tend to explain what we think are super complicated things, and you put them into simple terms, so it’s sort of accessible to the general public. I’ve got a lot of questions. JK:Ok. SS:Let’s start with the very obvious ones. There are plenty of warnings from the scientists nowadays about the inventions that we're currently working on, like the artificial intelligence or the robotics, or even the biological dangers. When you think about it, before we thought that science was the way out for the bright future. Now, more time passes, I get a sense that it actually may be turning into a tool of humanity’s demise, in a way. JK:Well, Sophie, I'm an optimist, and so I still think science ultimately is going to have to… You know, we need it to save humanity. Science is not good or bad. It's neutral, it’s knowledge. And knowledge, enlightenment is always better than ignorance. It's how we put that knowledge into use. So something like artificial intelligence, and robotics, automation… Yeah, sure, people are nervous. They're nervous about whether robots are going to replace their jobs. They're nervous about the whole “Terminator” movie scenario of machines taking over the world and becoming more intelligent than us. But AI is coming. It's already we're starting to see artificial intelligence happening, and we can't slow it down. My message tends to be “Let's make sure we're ready for it”, not “Let's slow it down or stop it”. But regulations, ethical considerations, and that goes for lots of other areas of science. SS:Right. You said, science is knowledge. But beside knowledge, it has become a real tool of ruling the world and with everything that is wrong right now with the world and in the world you're almost certain that science will end up in the wrong hands for the wrong purposes. No? JK:I certainly am concerned about issues such as genetic engineering, where we're moving very fast, and while some countries might put rules, and laws, and regulations about cloning, for example, other private organizations or countries may not. But we've always used our knowledge to develop technologies that change our world. You go back to the Industrial Revolution, even before that. Science has always shaped our lives. Sometimes it's for bad purposes… We've used it for evil, for building weapons of mass destruction. Sometimes it's for good reasons, for developing… SS:The man, who invented lobotomy, got a Nobel Prize, so yeah. JK:Right. Okay. Well, you know, there are some interesting examples. But I think about the advances in medicine. When people say, “If you could build a time machine, what time would you travel to?” Now. This is the best time to live. Despite all the problems and the issues facing humanity in the 21st century, now is still the best time to be alive, because of the advances in medicine and technology. Our lives are easier, are richer. So I'm still an optimist. I know we have huge challenges facing us in my lifetime and my children's lifetime, but I still think science can have the answer. SS:Because it has become so acute at this point, the breakthroughs that scientists are making, feels like we're on the verge of, I don’t know, becoming a different world and a different civilisation. Do you feel scientists (because they're more than scientists at this point with all these breakthroughs), do you feel they should be maybe more engaged in society politics? I don't know, maybe have more impact on decision making. Take global warming, for instance, I know you care a lot about it. So many scientists all around the world have been saying, “This is serious! This is happening!” And then you still have elected officials saying, “Uh? We don't think it's a big deal. It’s much ado about nothing”, you know. JK:Yeah, I think it's certainly true that scientific discoveries and technological advances are happening ever more rapidly. Maybe a thousand years ago, someone from the 10th century talking to some from the 9th century, they wouldn't have too much that wasn't in common. The gap in transformation of humanity is getting smaller and smaller. Now we look back and think, “Ten years ago, if I looked at my latest smartphone, I'd be amazed!” Things are happening more quickly. Scientists, absolutely, I think, really do need to step out of their laboratories, away from their offices, talk to wider society and think themselves about the implications and ethics of what they're doing. We can't slow down technological developments, but we need to engage with society about what it means to make sure we're ready for it. SS:But a stumbling point here is that a lot of scientists don't know how to talk. I remember interviewing a guy from CERN, we were talking about the discovery of the Higgs boson. And no matter how hard I tried, I wouldn't understand anything, no matter how much he tried to explain it to me. And I figured, maybe this is the problem why scientists can’t communicate these breakthroughs to people. You are an amazing example of “a science PR”, in a good way. Do you think right now there are things in science that cannot be communicable to the public? JK:Yes, I think that is true. I used to think that it doesn't matter what scientific subject we are discussing, it is simply a matter of finding the right language. The Higgs boson, your example, is a very good one. The people who developed the idea of the Higgs field and the Higgs mechanism, they've worked all their lives, 50-plus years to try to understand the detailed mathematics involved in this area of fundamental physics. What right does the wider public have in expecting it to be explained in a sound bite? The great American physicist Richard Feynman once was asked after he won his Nobel Prize, “Can you explain in one sentence what your Nobel Prize is for?” And he told the journalist, “Young man, if I could in a sentence, it wouldn't be worth a Nobel Prize.” So in a sense, sometimes some areas are complicated, but I think the wider issues, the important areas of science that impact on society (like climate change, like artificial intelligence, like our world's energy needs and food resources, like advances in medicine), yeah, we should be able to explain them at least the important aspects that the public need to be aware of. We don't expect everyone to become an expert, a brain surgeon, or a rocket scientist, or a nuclear physicist, but they should be able to understand the basics. SS:So we are going to get to artificial intelligence. But I suppose there are some things that still can be explained in a simple way. For instance, physics has come a long way from apples falling on heads. Right? It has become some sort of magic to people who don't really know it, especially when we're talking about quantum physics and quantum field. It’s still mind-boggling for me, how you can be looking at one thing and it's one thing then, and then it's a different thing when you're not looking. Can you explain to me, how is it possible that an electron can be in two places, at two points at the same time? OK, let's drop the “how” and “why” part- JK:Okay. SS:I'll just accept it as a fundamental truth. JK:Okay. SS:But why that can be in two points at the same time, and a tennis ball can’t. JK:Quantum mechanics is a great example because it is a very counter-intuitive scientific theory. We've had it for almost a century now, and yet, if you ask a quantum physicist to be really honest, they will tell you they also find it baffling, ridiculous, because it describes a world, the world of the very, very small, the level of atoms and the particles that make up atoms, which is a very different world from our familiar world of tennis balls. But it seems that's how our universe, how reality is at these smaller scales. So quantum mechanics is a powerful theory. It's very precise. It has helped develop so much of modern technology. Without it, we wouldn't have computers, we wouldn't have smartphones, we wouldn't have so much of modern technology, because quantum mechanics describes how electrons behave. But as you say, an electron being in two places at the same time is crazy. Part of the problem there is language, because to really get a correct view of what the quantum world is like, we need to describe it mathematically. Nature speaks the language of mathematics. If we convert it to human language (English in this case), then inevitably we are losing some of the subtleties. An electron isn't really in two places at once. The mathematics suggests that there's a probability of finding it here or there. And until you look and measure it, you cannot know. But quantum mechanics doesn't tell us what that electron is doing when you are not looking at it. And there are different philosophical ways (they're called the interpretations of quantum mechanics) that tell us different things about what that electron is doing. Maybe the universe is split into two, maybe the electron is like a spread-out cloud, maybe the electron can communicate instantaneously across the whole universe. There are all sorts of… But the weirdness is there, and that's what makes it for me so fascinating. But it's just crazy! SS:But when you say “weirdness”… Okay, that could be just an adjective to describe what you love. But do you have any doubt in what you love? Are you absolutely convinced? JK:Yes, scientists always have to have doubt. You know, that's built into our DNA that you cannot be certain of anything because tomorrow a new experiment or new observation might be made, which will suggest that my theory, quantum mechanics, for instance, was wrong all along. But in as much as I can be confident, I would say that I'm pretty, pretty sure that quantum mechanics is correct, and it’s the correct description of reality. You know, without quantum mechanics, we wouldn't have understood how semiconductors work. They're not metal conductors of electricity. They're not insulators like plastic or wood. They're in the middle. A semiconductor is… You know, a silicon chip is a semiconductor. So without quantum mechanics, we wouldn't have developed silicon chips. We wouldn't have had microchips, or integrated circuits, or computers. And if you look now at the world around us and how much our lives have been transformed by computers and hence the Internet and so on and so forth, none of that would have been possible if quantum mechanics wasn't correct. SS:So you're saying, “Just drop the philosophical side and stick to the practical side”? JK:I'm saying you can. You can do if you just want to be a pragmatic, what’s called “an instrumentalist”. This is someone who doesn't care about all the philosophic detail. I just want to use it. For me, that's almost… SS:But you dig the philosophical part of it? JK:I like it, because I'm a physicist. I mean, in a sense, I'm talking about the distinction between a scientist, a physicist and an engineer. A physicist has all the deep thoughts. An engineer wants to use the knowledge to do something useful in the world. SS:It's kind of like a historian and a writer who writes a literature book about that period of time. JK:I guess so. Yeah, I guess so. I think a physicist is curious about “how”. How is that electron doing what it's doing? An engineer will say, “That's fine. This equation will help me develop something that will improve humanity, something useful.” But for me, I'm still obsessed with the underlying philosophy of how it behaves the way it does. SS:You have once said that you would really hope that scientists will at some point work on quantum teleportation. At this point, we know that scientists have been able to teleport information. Do you think that we could at some point teleport matter? JK:In theory, in principle, it's possible. SS:How would that work? JK:Well, if you can teleport information so you'd have to have… You know, if we think about a single particle, not even an atom, a particle that makes up an atom, an electron, say, or a photon, a particle of light, to teleport that photon from there to there, you're not actually moving the matter, you're moving the information. That is what's being transferred. So you're not moving a material object. If you extrapolate that, you want to move a whole lump of material in a particular arrangement of atoms, you need to have the raw material in the other place already. And the information is transferred to reconstitute what you had originally. So in “Star Trek”, when Captain Kirk is transported down to a planet, it's not him. It's not the... I mean… SS:Yeah. JK:Physics says that it's not actually him. There have to be atoms of oxygen, and carbon, and nitrogen, and hydrogen, and all the other atoms that make up a human – all have to be there. And the information about those atoms that make up Captain Kirk in that arrangement, all that information has to be transferred to reconstitute him on the planet's surface. But that information is incredibly complex. We can talk about transporting information about one particle, but when you have trillions of particles arranged in a very special way to make up a living human being, it's almost inconceivable. SS:I was going to ask if there is a such thing as a teleport in the foreseeable future, would you step into it, honestly? JK:Well, that becomes quite an interesting metaphysical question, because if it does work– SS:Can you transport consciousness with the atoms of your body? Wouldn't that be kind of death? JK:Well, for me, I would say that consciousness is a particular state of the atoms, the neurons that make up my brain. Consciousness isn't a magical extra thing. I'm just made of atoms ultimately arranged in a special way that are thinking and now talking to you. So if we're teleporting me, we are also teleporting my consciousness. But, of course, my philosophical problem will be that it's not me that has arrived at the other end. It's a new version of me. SS:It’s the information about you, right. JK:And I'd be a bit worried about any glitches or… SS:Right. JK:…or errors. SS:Where would the real you be stuck in all this, right? JK:Yeah, exactly. So you know what is a real me? Similarly, if you make a clone of me, which one is the real me? Is there such a thing as the real me? That's an interesting philosophical question. But I don't think teleportation is going to happen in my lifetime, if ever. I think it's hundreds of years in the future. SS:Another thing that you always talk about is quantum biology, and that's marrying quantum physics with biological processes. Most of your books are very much about how the world that we're living is governed and depends on quantum biology. Can you give me some very obvious examples? JK:Yeah. I mean, this is a new field. It's still somewhat speculative. I would dare even say controversial. Quantum mechanics has been used in physics, so we have quantum physics. We have quantum chemistry. But quantum biology is new. And part of it is historical because when quantum mechanics developed in the 1920s and 30s, it was developing at the same time as biology was developing genetics and molecular biology, and molecular biology and genetics didn't need quantum mechanics. Now we're starting to see particular examples of where maybe quantum mechanics is necessary to explain the processes of life, for example, in photosynthesis, the way a plant leaf captures sunlight and converts it into chemical energy. One stage in that very complicated biochemical process requires… You talked about the electron being in two places at once. In this case, it looks like that photon, the particle of light, follows multiple routes through the cell simultaneously. One photon moving in lots of directions at the same time. If it sounds ridiculous to you – exactly! Welcome to quantum mechanics! But in my view, if quantum mechanics… If life has had for nearly four billion years to find tricks to develop and to evolve, and according to Darwinian evolution, if quantum mechanics offered an advantage, life would have found a way of utilizing it. So maybe now there are half a dozen or so different examples. So if photosynthesis is one– SS:What kind of mysteries can quantum biology uncover about life on Earth that we don't know at all about? JK:Well, we simply don't know. At the moment we're just looking at very specific mechanisms saying, “It looks like that would only work if that particle was behaving in a quantum sort of way”. Maybe, you know, our sense of smell or the way certain animals sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation. We know they do that. Maybe they use some quantum trickery to do that. So these are very specific examples which are not going to change the way we see the world. But the bigger picture, even more speculative, is that maybe life is special because it can use quantum mechanics in a way that inanimate matter cannot use. Because one of the big questions is “What does it mean to be alive? What is the difference between life and non-life?” Maybe quantum mechanics has a role to play in answering that question. SS:From my understanding, quantum biology is also very much about DNA, the importance of the DNA mechanism in general. Do you think breakthroughs in quantum biology could bring us closer to gene editing? JK:Possibly. I mean, the whole area of genetic engineering and gene editing seems to be moving very quickly without any quantum mechanics. Thank you very much. But of course, we are not talking about individual particles, protons, which are the nuclei of hydrogen atoms. They are being moved around. They form the glue that holds the DNA strands together. But when you talk about protons, you're talking about the world of quantum mechanics. These particles are so small they behave according to the rules of quantum mechanics. So it's crazy to think that those processes down at the level of biomolecules in DNA don't obey the laws of quantum mechanics as well. So maybe quantum mechanics is going to be necessary to really understand that. SS:How difficult is it to be working in a field that is still largely theoretical? Is it hard to get funding and grants from bureaucrats? JK:Well, I'm lucky I work in a university where we are expected to pursue sort of curiosity-driven research. We don't have to justify. If I was working for an organization or private company, they would want to know, “What is the product that your science is going to help us develop that we can sell to make money?” In a university we don't. We can pursue intellectual curiosity. Blue sky research. It's always difficult to get funding, but there are mechanisms involved. You apply for grants, and then they ask you to think and come up with theories and ideas and developments that may, of course, one day have an application. SS:So you've done that all your life, come up with theories. And you’ve thought about theories of others. How much in general do we know about universe? I mean, how much holes are there in our perception of the world in percentages? Do we even know 5 per cent of how things work? JK:It depends who you talk to. You're talking to me. I think there have been stages in the history of science, and physics in particular, because physics tends to be the most arrogant of the sciences. You know, we are dealing with the biggest questions, the fundamental issues of reality. And there've been periods when we thought we were almost there. The end of the 19th century: we thought, you know, we had electromagnetism and thermodynamics and Newton's mechanics, we could understand the universe. And then we discover x-rays. What is that! We discover radioactivity. We discover the structure of the atom. And suddenly there's a new revolution by the beginning of the 20th century. Einstein comes along. The pioneers of quantum mechanics come along. And then the end of the 20th century: people like Stephen Hawking were saying… He famously wrote a paper, maybe about 1980, saying we're coming to the end of theoretical physics, almost everything is understood. Now we realize all the matter in the universe that we know of is only 5 per cent of the stuff out there. There's dark energy and dark matter. We have our two most successful theories – quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity, and we don't know how they fit together. So my view is that we still have a long way to go, and that's great! Because I want for there to be lots more we don’t know. SS:It’s funny you mentioned relativity and quantum together, because I was talking to Michio Kaku maybe a year or two ago. And he was like, “My goal is to combine relativity, quantum and other theories and come up with one formula that would explain everything.” I mean, is this too romantic, or is it actually possible? Is it feasible? JK:I'm not sure it is feasible. It's always been the sort of the headline. The ultimate holy grail of theoretical physics, is to come up with the “theory of everything”, the equation to wear on your T-shirt. I don't know how possible that is. We don't think quantum mechanics is wrong. We don't think relativity is wrong. But there are two very different theories. And then there's also the nature of time itself. I think we're moving slowly in the right direction. But I'm not sure we're going to be able to simplify it into a single packed theory that describes all phenomena. I think it's going to be more complicated than that. SS:Do you believe in parallel realities? Scientists who actually work with black holes and quantum physics and all of that, are talking about time travel, and they're talking about time travel not like crazy people, but like scientists. JK:Yeah. I mean, the first book I wrote was about time travel. It’s 20 years ago now. It's fun. I think time travel is fun. But if you asked me, “In reality, are there parallel universes?” I'm not sure. One of the most popular ways of explaining the strangeness of quantum mechanics is called the “many-worlds interpretation”. And it's a very smart idea. And it may be… I still need convincing, but it's almost like a religious ideology. You know, there are physicists who believe in the many-worlds interpretation, there are physicists, who believe in the Copenhagen interpretation, which is another view of quantum mechanics. And there are others as well. So although we all use quantum mechanics, and we all agree on the maths, and we all agree on the technology that quantum mechanics has helped us to develop, we can't agree on what it all means. And parallel realities, parallel universes is just one way of explaining the strangeness. SS:So it's all at this point within the realm of theory. There's nothing that actually can be observable in a scientific way. JK:No. We've tried for ever since almost the beginning of development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, there have been different ways and arguments about what it all means, but we haven't yet been smart enough to come up with an experiment or test that would tell us: that's right, that's wrong. So these are called the interpretations of quantum mechanics. I still hope, for me, that's my ultimate ambition, that before I die, I will know what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. SS:All right. Jim Al-Khalili, thank you so much for this interview. It's been a pleasure talking to you. JK:My pleasure, too. Thank you. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"12 Oct, 2019 14:56",How much energy would it take to travel through time?,"Time travel has always fascinated mankind, but a Star Trek kind of warp drive has till now been impossible to build. This hasn’t discouraged scientists to continue researching it. Scientists have long debated the practicality of warp drive—or traveling faster than the speed of light. While some argue that the entire concept defies the laws of physics as we know it, others continue to press on in their effort to prove that warp drive could one day be a reality, sparking an era in which we would finally become a true space-voyaging species. Warp drive is just plain awesome; after all, the idea of going where no man has gone before holds great appeal, and the opportunities it would afford are literally endless. But while scientists duke it out over the feasibility of this faster-than-light warp drive, those of us with a non-scientific brain are left befuddled as to what that means. What itreallymeans. So before we get into the possibilities, challenges, and opportunities of traveling faster than light, we must break it down into useable, everyday concepts for those of us who do not speak Science. In Star Trek, warp drive is achieved when matter and antimatter collide in a fusion-like fashion, which is mediated by dilithium crystals. Of course, dilithium crystals don’t really exist, but the rest of the ingredients for warp drive really do exist. The matter we’re talking about here is deuterium, which is a hydrogen gas—in real life. Antimatter exists too. While matter is composed of particles, antimatter is made up of antiparticles. Antimatter has the same mass and spin as its matter counterpart, but it has an opposite electric charge and opposite properties. When the antimatter and matter collide, they are both destroyed, creating a source of energy that would propel a spaceship at speeds greater than light travels. There are several challenges to the concept of warp drive, but the greatest challenge is overcoming a little thing known asEinstein’s Theory of Relativity. The theory goes like this, according to Roger Rassool,physicist at the University of Melbourne: “As objects travel faster and faster, they get heavier and heavier—the heavier they get, the harder it is to achieve acceleration, so you never get to the speed of light.”  Even if you could go faster than the speed of light, the energy it would take to do that is substantial. The amount of energy it would take is equal to the mass-energy of a total universe. Or does it? Not all scientists are ready to give up on the idea just yet, despite it violating the Theory of Relativity and requiring more energy than is practical. In the ‘90s, physicist Miguel Alcubierre theorized about how we could get around that pesky Theory of Relativity by theorizing that a spaceship could travel at the speed of light without actually traveling at the speed of light—instead, the spaceship would travel inside a “wave”, created by stretching the fabric of spacetime. But Alcubierre’s drive still would require a massive amount of energy, not to mention Alcubierre’s drive concept was just theoretical, with some arguing that it, too, was impossible. But that didn’t stop NASA from carrying on with the experiments. And they did manage to make some progress. Again, theoretically speaking. But progress in this field is ongoing, and in August, new work on this warp drive concept was presented by Joseph Agnew, undergraduate engineering student at University of Alabama in Huntsville’s Propulsion Research Center, who said at this year’s American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Propulsion and Energy Forum that he had watched Star Trek (both the old and new) and noticed how Star Trek had either predicted or inspired countless innovations. He has since spent the bulk of his academic career researching the idea of a warp drive. ""In my experience, the mention of warp drive tends to bring chuckles to the conversation because it is so theoretical and right out of science fiction. In fact, often it is met with dismissive remarks, and used as an example of something totally outlandish, which is understandable,”Agnew said. In the last decade, progress has continued, leaving lots of “bite-size” problems still to be addressed, Agnew said, as opposed to one massive challenge. But if there were one big challenge with warp drive, it would be the energy; the amount of positive and negative energy that would be required to create the warp bubble outlined in the Alcubierre drive would be massive and impractical. Scientists agree that this would have to come from exotic matter, which would theoretically cut down the amount of energy required down to a mass the size of Jupiter. What would it take? To put this warp drive reality into practice, there are still many hurdles that remain, including major funding, progress in quantum physics and significant advancements in alternate forms of energy that would be sufficient to propel a starship through the solar system in a reasonable amount of time.

"11 Oct, 2019 07:50",Musk’s Neuralink brain chip project is a fairy tale – neurosurgeon,"Love, hate, and our brightest ideas – all born in the body’s most fascinating and complex organ. We talked to a man who literally looks into other people’s brains – Dr. Henry Marsh, one of Britain’s top neurosurgeons. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Dr. Henry Marsh. Great pleasure to be here with you in your wonderful, lovely home. Thanks for having us. Henry Marsh:Pleasure. SS:So I’ve got all the big questions. First of all, I know that you’ve said something like “In medicine, in general, you can never really be too certain.” I mean, it’s like if you go to a general practitioner he prescribes you drug and let's see, maybe it works and if it doesn't, then he’d try another drug. But with cut-and-try it wouldn't quite work that way, would it? HM:As doctors we deal in probabilities. Nothing is ever certain. As a surgeon and obviously as a neurosurgeon what I do is not representative of all of medicine. If you recommend surgery to somebody, what you're saying is “the probability of the operation doing more good than harm is a bit better than the probability of your coming to harm if you don’t do the operation”. But these are probabilities. So let's say, I say “Well, there's a 95 per cent chance the operation will be successful removing a difficult brain tumour, which is what I specialise in doing, and a 5 per cent chance you'll die”, and then the patient dies because of the operation and the family will be very cross. They'll say: “You said there's a 95 per cent chance of success.” I say: “Yes, but I said there was a 5 per cent chance of disaster.” The same with the weather forecast. They're never wrong because there's always a probability. But from a patient's point of view, as patients, and I've been a patient myself, and my own son had a brain tumour, we want certainty. We want to know what will happen to me. Not a 95 per cent this or a 5 per cent that. So there’s a huge difference between the doctor’s perspective and the patient's perspective. SS:We can actually swap roles in a little bit. Before we do that, I know that you specialise in brain surgery with local anaesthesia. HM:Yes. SS:Basically, the patient isn't sleeping when you’re operating on him. HM:Yes, that's right. SS:What is the reasoning behind it? HM:Because - it only applies for certain sorts of tumour - tumours which are actually part of the brain, in the brain itself, consisting in effect of brain tissue, not of nerve tissue, with the cells calledglial cellsthat surround and support and kind of look after the nerve cells. And the tumour looks very much like the brain and feels like the brain. It doesn't come with little dotted black lines and a pair of scissors saying: “cut here, don’t cut there”. And if the tumour is in a very important part of the brain, for instance, here in the speech area - most of us have speech here or movement here, - just looking at the brain with the patient anesthetised doesn't tell you where to stop, because the edge of the tumour looks like the edge of the brain. If the patient's awake you can ask the patient to do things, you can ask the patient to talk. You can use electrical stimulation to work out roughly where you are. SS:So have you ever seen a significant change in a person's brain as you operate “live”, so per se? HM:Yes, occasionally. Well, the most common reason is that somebody has an epileptic fit while you're operating and then they can become unconscious or paralysed or stop talking - things like that. If there's a problem with the operation, and you actually start damaging important brain, the patient will start to lose the function of that part of the brain, so occasionally I've had patients who started to lose the ability to talk or become paralysed down the opposite side of the body. It's a real risk, it happens. Not very often, but it happens. SS:What makes operating brain much more difficult and sensitive than operating something like heart or spinal cord? HM:Two things. First of all, the brain does not heal in the way bone and muscle and skin heals. Every time you cut the brain you damage it, and it won't recover. And secondly, the brain is incredibly delicate. You can damage some parts of the brain, you can kill the patient just by damaging one or two millimetres of brain tissue. Other parts of the brain can sustain quite a lot of damage - in particular, at the front on the right - without the person seeming to suffer any harm. But it’s very vulnerable, it's very delicate, it has the consistency of thick cream cheese. The main surgical instrument is a sucker - the miniature vacuum cleaner. Brain surgery is horribly crude actually. People think it's all terribly... It is high tech, but the actual reality is actually quite crude compared to the incredible complexity of the brain. SS:You do have to cut the skull, right? HM:That's easy. That's all right. That’s a simple bit. That you can do with the patient awake. If you put local anaesthetic in the skin, the problems will start once you open the membrane that covers the brain, themeninges-  and that's where the trouble starts, that's where it becomes very dangerous. SS:But I suppose like if someone has been doing this over and over again for years and years, and it is a job like anything else, and you've said it yourself, it's not the process…. HM:It's not a job like anything else, because you're dealing in people's lives. And if you make mistakes, the consequences are terrible. Now, sure, some surgeons and some doctors become very detached from their patients. And it depends on the culture you work in. I've worked in countries all over the world, and in some countries, the surgeons really seem to have minimal human emotional contact with their patients. SS:What's better: to be emotionally involved or to be detached? HM:“It's a question of balance” is the answer. It's a question of what patients expect. In countries like Sudan and Nepal and to a certain extent Ukraine, all of which I know well, the patients and certainly the patients’ families often do not want to know the truth, and they really don't want to be told how bad the disease is. On the whole and in England and in America, on the whole, patients and their families want to know the truth more or less. But even then with diseases like cancer, if it’s a cancer we can't cure, to get the balance right between giving the patient hope and being realistic is very difficult - and to get that balance right - and you often fail - you have to have some emotional rapport with the patients. If you are a completely cold detached technician you will not handle these problems well. SS:But what about the process itself? I mean, if you had someone in your life that you really love who needed to get brain surgery, would you rather do it yourself? HM:No, you can’t, you couldn't, you’re far too in it. My son had a brain tumour. SS:So that's what I am asking. So, you would ask a trusted colleague? HM:I wasn’t, I was doing general surgery and training at the time. He was only three months old. And some people say: “Did you operate yourself?” And I say, no way! You couldn't! Because all your mechanisms of self-preservation and detachment... you'd be simply too anxious. I once operated on a close personal friend, on my daughter's godmother with a malignant brain tumour. So, I knew she was going to die, and the operation was simply what's called a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. And a very-very simple operation. So a bit reluctantly I agreed to do it because the family were very keen I should do it because we were close friends. And even that I found almost impossible, because I was so anxious, because I was not detached. SS:What's the hardest decision you had to make? Because I understand, brain surgery is a lot about decision-making. HM: Yes. That’s a real problem. I had to make many difficult decisions. I think some of the ones... I have many regrets over 40 years of practice. I think some of the most difficult decisions were when I treated people too much. I should have stopped. I operated when there was no realistic hope, and all I did was add to the patients’ and the families’ suffering. I can think of quite a few patients where I did that. On the other hand, with surgeons who are cold and detached, they will do that, and it doesn't trouble them. SS:So you've said that we will actually never know how the brain works… HM: Well, I think it’s unlikely. I mean the whole point about the future is that it’s unpredictable. So I think it's unlikely, we'll ever understand the brain in the way we can understand how a computer works or a clock works. And I think it’s unlikely. Somebody once said, you can't cut butter with a knife made of butter. I don’t know. But with the present technology we have of MRI brain scanning, electrode implantation in monkeys, and to a certain extent in human beings - it’s very limited to how much it will tell us. And we can't experiment on ourselves. We can't cut open our fellow humans’ brains and fiddle around with them, do experiments on them. We can to a certain extent on chimpanzees. I feel rather sorry for chimpanzees. Anyway, it's becoming increasingly difficult for ethical reasons. So there are major limits to what we can, to actual scientific research we can do on the brain. SS: So following that logic you never really actually know what a patient's brain will do after the surgery and all we have to do is look? HM: Well, you know to a certain extent, because we understand how various parts of the brain are more important for some [functions]. We know as the areas of speech and vision. Sure, they're all tied in together in complicated ways we don't understand. But with the operating, on the whole, you have a pretty good idea what you can get away with, so to speak, without damaging the patient, and when an operation is impossible. SS: How closely are neuroscience and neurosurgery related, in the sense that do discoveries in neuroscience actually make advances in neurosurgery? HM: Not very, except in what's called functional neurosurgery where you put electrodes into the brain for conditions like Parkinson's disease and things like that. There and again under epilepsy surgery, because there was quite where neuroscience is involved, you can take electrical recording of some single brain cells in terms of planning what to do. But in terms of the everyday problems like operating on patients who’ve haemorrhages, head injuries, things like that - pure neuroscience is a completely different [area], is a world away from the everyday world of the neurosurgeon. SS:So you don't think of a human brain like neuroscientists think of a huge computer? HM: No, on the whole not. I mean, as a surgeon I'm more like a plumber. I mean, the relationship between neurosurgeons and neuroscientists is rather like the relationship between plumbers and physicists who deal with the quantum mechanical properties of metals - there is a big gap. SS:So when you're operating on brains you can remove something, right? You can remove the ability to talk, or to see, or to hear. Can you add something to a personality? HM: No, there's been sort of fashions for implantation mainly using foetal brain cells from foetuses’ stem cells, but none of it's really worked yet. In terms of electronic implants - not really. I mean, there are various computer-brain interfaces, where you put electrodes on the brain, and this is being used on people who are completely paralysed. And then some of them then by thinking can actually move a robotic arm. SS: I’ve read these crazy surgical records where it said that the human brain can be cut in half... HM: It’s partially cut in half. SS: They have a name for that… HM: Callosotomy. SS: Exactly. HM: Split-brain. Yes, it’s a famous research done in the 1980s by Gazzaniga and Sperry. For certain sorts of epilepsy, dividing part of the brain in the middle, the two cerebral hemispheres, and they are two halves of the brain up here, which then join together. It’s like a trunk of a tree. The brainstem is the trunk. You can’t touch that. If you touch that, people die or are left terribly disabled. But then the trunk splits into two main hemispheres like that, and they’re joined by something called thecorpus callosumwhich is billions of nerve fibres connecting the top of the right side of the brain to top of the left side of the brain. And if you cut part of that, it can help certain sorts of epilepsy in particular form of epilepsy where people just fall on the ground, called a drop attack. These people appear normal. If you met them you wouldn't know part of their brain had been cut in half. But you can carry out experiments on them where there's a sort of barrier which divides what they're seeing -  the visual field - so the right side of the brain can only see things on the left, and the left side of the brain can only see things on the right. SS: And supposedly they also suffer from split personality in some cases? HM: Well, they do in the sense, yes. I mean sort of… But with this special experimental set-up. It's as though they're two separate people in there — to a certain extent. SS:And you can’t sew it up, back again? HM:No, you can’t. But the story is told of one man who had a split-brain operation and lost his temper with his wife and wanted to hit her with his left hand which was controlled by the right hemisphere, and then his right hand pulled it back. It may not be true but it's an illustration of the way you end up with this sort of split personality. SS:So, let's just roll forward. I know you don't like this whole science fiction but we're not there yet. I'm talking about something else. Let's say we do have this crazy technology to achieve it, where two people, let's say you and I, we want to swap one hemisphere with another. Is it possible? HM: No. SS: No way? HM: No way. SS: Okay. HM: There are eighty-five billion nerve cells in the human brain. If you took one cubic millimetre of the cerebral cortex - the surface of the brain - that can contain up to 100 000 nerve cells and 1 billion electrical connections. That is seriously complicated. SS:Complicated, but theoretically? HM:Theoretically. I don't believe in the human soul. I believe everything you and I are thinking and feeling at the moment is generated by the activity of our brains. But we really don't know how. I mean, yes, we understand a certain amount about vision and movement, but how consciousness arises, how pain arises - we haven't a clue. And there's no way… It happens. For most people like myself with enough knowledge of the brain, thought and feeling are physical phenomena, but the fact of the matter is that contemporary science even at the level of quantum mechanics cannot explain it. Which means we're very ignorant, there's a huge gap in our scientific understanding of the world. SS:Maybe by the time we understand (if we ever understand) that's where the evolution of the human race ends probably, too. That's why we don't know much about it. You told me you don't watch much TV so I don't assume you've watched this series “Altered Carbon”. HM:No, haven’t watched. SS:Okay. It's pretty much about how you can take one person's brain and transplant it into another. HM:That’s a science-fiction. SS:Like Sheckley. I'm sure you read him. HM:It's science-fiction. SS:It’s nonsense? HM:It’s funny. SS:There's no way we can ever achieve something like that? HM:Not in the foreseeable future. Likewise, the idea that some people have, that we can download our brains on the computer. SS:That's what Elon Musk is saying so that you can enhance human brain with the chips. Is that science-fiction? HM:That’s fairy-tales. SS:Seriously? Because they're saying they’re already experimenting on it. HM:Yes, sure, that's fairy-tales. I'm not saying it's impossible but with our present level of neuroscience and technology, there's no way we can do it. SS:So this whole new fashion of maybe becoming immortal... HM:Transhumanists, yes. It's fairy-tales. It's the old fear of death written in another form. Giving people who've lost, who have a deep fear of death... We have the need to feel we’ll live forever which until the modern age took the form of religious belief in an afterlife; the need for that belief is still there, but now some people dress it up in pseudo-scientific terms. SS:All I'm saying is that when we see in today's medicine, how people are being robotised for needs like you can replace an organ, an artificial organ, so then you're asking yourself maybe someday... HM:In theory, it is possible. I won't say it's impossible. But 85 billion nerve cells, trillions of connections between them - it’s quite difficult. SS:So all of that like “put this cyber port in your brain” - that's like not happening ever? HM:That’s science fiction. SS:So tell me something: we do understand how memory is stored in a brain, don’t we? HM:Not, really no. Very little. SS:So there's no way we can remove what we don't want from the brain? HM:No. I mean we understand some sort… with a limited understanding. Put it this way: we know which bits of the brain, if they get damaged, where we lose the ability to make new short-term memories in particular parts of the brain called the hippocampus and the fornices that are so-called experiments of nature: you see people who've had damage either from a head injury or from an operation. They can't make short-term memories. Long-term memories which is what eventually we lose with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia seem to be more to do with the brain as a whole rather than any individual points. But nobody can locate a memory in the brain. Having said that, we know that maps are located in the hippocampus. As a famous study done on London taxi drivers, you may have heard of an MRI scanning which had London taxi drivers, you’d have to pass this examination called “The Knowledge”. They have to know the entire road map of London and not just the layout but which are one-way roads, which is the quickest way of getting it from Belsize Park to Brompton Road or something. It takes years to learn, and the hippocampi in these London taxi drivers, the ones who passed the test are bigger than the ones of people who failed the test. Likewise, you know that professional pianists have bigger hand areas in the movement area of the brain than in non-professional pianists’. SS:So I don't know if you've operated any real-time geniuses but would their brain be any different from?... HM:No. Not what you can see. I mean, it’s like all these ideas of, you know, Lenin's brain was kept, and Einstein's brain was cut into slices. This is a very simplistic way. Sure. But by definition, every brain is different because we're all different. We are our brains. Every time we think a thought, that is a physical process in our brains. So an awful lot of current neuroscience and particularly cognitive neuroscience which is what psychologists now call themselves is really just saying, “Well, yes, when we think certain thoughts, certain parts of the brain are more active”. That doesn't actually at the end of the day explain anything because we know already that everything we think and feel is a physical process in our brains. SS:So, you are a man of science, I don't suppose you believe in anything like the afterlife or… HM:No. So we'll put it this way. I think it's unlikely. You can't prove it or disprove it, but it seems unlikely to me. And why as a neurosurgeon it seems unlikely, because I see and have seen many-many people who suffered damage to the front part of their brain, which is where our social behaviour and moral behaviour seems to be organised, because people have suffered particular head injuries, they've suffered damage to the front of the brain, they suffer personality change, they suffer personality change in terms of their behaviour towards other people. It was also almost always for the worse: they've become cruder, vulgar, swear, coarse, disinhibited. SS:And you can't reverse it anyway. HM:And if what we think makes us particularly human can be altered by physical damage to our brain, well, when our brains die, I reckon, we die. SS:Not necessarily. I mean the moral part is more like the religious part, but I'm just saying it can be anything. But would that mean that those billions, and billions, and billions of nerves that are connected to each other and their existence the minute person's heart stops to beat? HM:Well. There's a rather alarming work done recently in America looking at dead pigs’ brains when they went to an abattoir. They took some brains out of pigs that have been killed a few hours earlier and showed that some of the brain cells are still alive. They'll die in time and what it means goodness knows. Likewise, you know some patients in what's called persistent vegetative state just lie there without moving, have been tube-fed. You know, they’re only alive because of medical treatment. Some of them, it seems, have some kind of activity in their brains. Then we don't know what it means. It’s all very strange. SS:So, it is very strange but still thanks a lot for shedding at least some light on this strange world of neurosurgery. HM:Casting light is to say it's even more… As of all science. You open the door, and then you find a lot of new doors on the other side. Religion it's the other way round, it's a closed door and there all the questions are answered. With science you ask a question - you have an answer and then a lot of new questions appear. That's what's so interesting. SS:I suppose that's how life works in general. HM:Well, yes. But as we get older it kind of runs down a bit. SS:Anyway, thank you so much for a wonderful chat. It's been a pleasure talking to you. Good luck in everything. HM:Thank you very much.

"4 Oct, 2019 13:56",Space bagel: Russia to fly donut-shaped spaceship to edge of solar system,"A team of Russian scientists is developing a donut-shaped spaceship that can reach the farthest corners of the solar system in record time by taking power directly from the Sun. The spaceship’s clever method of sourcing fuel will allow it to overtake even the fastest probes, unravel questions about the origin of comets, and even provide electricity to future martian colonists, all while proving Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The plate covering the middle part of the bagel-shaped ship is a solar sail. It is coated in a special substance that will begin to evaporate as it approaches the Sun, giving the ship a boost of jet acceleration without having to carry heavy engines. Using the pressure of sunlight in this ingenious manner will allow the sailboat to speedily get to the mysterious Oort cloud at the edge of the solar system, where it’s believed that comets are born. “The duration of flights to other stars is gigantic. The Voyager 1 high-speed space probe will take 300 years to reach the Oort cloud. Our sail can reach it in 20-30 years,”said Professor Olga Starinova, of Samara University’s Department of Space Engineering. “This means that we or the next generation will be able to obtain evidence of existence clouds, presumably generating all comets, and examine what remains of the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago,”she explained. The highly advanced technology will also make it possible to prove fundamental laws of physics, such as Einstein’s famous theory, that cannot be achieved under Earth’s conditions. It will also be able to“warm”Mars by reflecting the Sun’s rays, helping to enable the colonization of the Red Planet. The researchers have already calculated flights to all the other planets in the solar system and learned that small sailboats can be in orbits near Jupiter, Saturn or Mars for a long time, relaying scientific data back to Earth. They are now figuring out how to fly as close to the Sun as possible without burning in order to enable long-distance missions to neighboring star systems. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Sep, 2019 15:28","Facepalm: Maths never helped Einstein ‘discover gravity,’ Indian minister says","India’s railways minister tried to warn against worrying about “GDP maths” as “maths never helped Einstein discover gravity,” seemingly unaware that the natural phenomenon was discovered nearly 200 years before Einstein was born. Speaking to reporters following a meeting with the Board of Trade, Minister for Railways and Commerce Piyush Goyal sought to reassure the public about the prospects of the Indian government hitting a target of becoming a $5 trillion economy. “Don’t go by all these calculations you see on TV, that if the country has to become a $5 trillion economy, it will have to grow at 12 percent but right now it is currently growing at 6-7 percent,”Goyal said.“Don’t get into those maths. Those maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity.” Goyal argued that, had Einstein followed the tried-and-trusted“structured formulae,”there wouldn’t have been any innovation. There was just one major flaw: Sir Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and universal gravitation in ‘The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,’ in 1687, some 192 years before Einstein was even born. Unsurprisingly, Twitter users did not react kindly to the minister’s major mishap.

"12 Sep, 2019 13:20",Heart of darkness: Black holes may hide pure dark energy cores that are expanding the universe,"Black holes could hide cores of pure dark energy which are quite literally pushing apart our universe at its very seams, according to an exciting new cosmological theory based on the work of two Russian physicists. University of Hawaii astrophysicist Kevin Croker and mathematician Joel Weiner examined some long-standing and far-reaching scientific theories about the universe on which a lot of modern day astrophysics is based. In doing so, they stumbled upon an idea which might force a rethink of our interpretations of fundamental physics. “It is now clear that general relativity can observably connect collapsed stars – regions the size of Honolulu – to the behavior of the universe as a whole, over a thousand billion billion times larger,”said Croker. Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann laid the foundation for the now widely-accepted view that the universe has been steadily expanding for the past 13.8 billion years, based on a novel set ofequationsderived from Einstein’s work. However, though useful, Friedmann's equations were based on the assumption that matter in space, of whatever kind, is of roughly the same type and is spread out fairly evenly, essentially not seeing the cosmic wood for the intergalactic trees, as under his model, smaller objects might be disregarded as not having a big enough (if any) effect on the wider universe. But Croker and Weiner wanted to see what would happen to space, and the objects within, if they made some changes to the fundamental parameters of Friendmann’s equations. It turns out the change is quite drastic indeed. Using their updated model, the averaged contributions of all objects might have a profound effect on the universe around them, and may also cause them to lose or gain energy depending on what type of object they are. In 1966, a Russian physicist named Erast Gliner, proposed a model in which spaces close to the Big Bang event may have produced immense anti-gravitational effects; spaces which appeared like black holes from the outside, but were actually vast bubbles of energy ‘flexing’ against the rest of the universe. He dubbed these spaces Generic Objects of Dark Energy (GEODEs). Building on the work of these two Russian scientists, Croker and Wiener, believe that even if just a few ancient stars were to have collapsed into GEODEs, it would explain the universe’s observed but as yet unexplained accelerating expansion. “What we have shown is that if GEODEs do exist, then they can easily give rise to observed phenomena that presently lack convincing explanations,”the researchers said. “We anticipate numerous other observational consequences of a GEODE scenario, including many ways to exclude it. We’ve barely begun to scratch the surface.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"12 Jul, 2019 10:48","‘Unexpected’: Hubble discovers supermassive black hole ‘that shouldn't exist’, says NASA","The Hubble space telescope has discovered a supermassive black hole 130 million light-years from Earth that scientists say “shouldn’t exist” if Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity are to be believed. The mysterious black hole has an “unexpected” thin disk of material furiously whirling around it. The conundrum, the space agencyexplains, is that according to current astronomical theories, the disk shouldn’t be there. “We’ve never seen the effects of both general and special relativity in visible light with this much clarity,”saidMarco Chiaberge, a member of the team that conducted the Hubble study. Their research ispublishedin the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The black hole is located at the heart of a spiral galaxy called NGC 3147. Black holes like this one are described as “malnourished” for their lack of gravitationally-captured material to ‘feed’ on, and the surrounding in-falling material typically spreads out into a donut-shaped haze. However, the ferocious disk encircling this hungry black hole moves at more than 10 percent the speed of light and resembles those found in extremely active galaxies with “engorged, monster black holes,” NASA said. “It’s the same type of disk we see in objects that are 1,000 or even 100,000 times more luminous,” the study’s first author, Stefano Bianchi, explained. “The predictions of current models for gas dynamics in very faint active galaxies clearly failed.” The international team of researchers are drawing on their unexpected find to test Einstein’s theories, and are still using Hubble to search for more galaxies that might play host to similar head-scratching disks.

"23 May, 2019 16:11","Risk of nuclear war is highest since WW2, perhaps it is time to start paying attention","Debates over pressing issues such as climate change, healthcare and global poverty will ultimately be rendered pointless if crazed neocons decide to make the world uninhabitable by launching a nuclear war. According to theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the Doomsday Clock is still 2 minutes to midnight – a new abnormal. Having become disillusioned with this particular noteworthy development being buried under the media’s radar for far too long, director of the UN Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) Renata Dwan hasspokenout against the threat of nuclear war, calling it an “urgent” issue that the world should take more seriously. To be fair, we live in a world where the people will only take an issue seriously if they are told to take it seriously – by the media. The risk of nuclear warfare is no exception, despite its catastrophic consequences. If you want people to understand the urgent threat nuclear arms pose to the world, the media would do well to start talking about it more. According to Dwan, all states with nuclear weapons are in the process of modernizing their nuclear weapons, which in turn is changing the arms control landscape. She also believes this is partially due to growing competition between China and the United States. “I think that it’s genuinely a call to recognize – and this has been somewhat missing in the media coverage of the issues – that the risks of nuclear war are particularly high now, and the risks of the use of nuclear weapons, for some of the factors I pointed out, are higher now than at any time since World War Two,” Dwan said. Albert Einstein once famously said: “I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” To launch a nuclear war is to launch the unthinkable. Unfortunately,unthinkingis all too common in the age of Donald Trump, so we have to be even more vigilant about this issue than we ordinarily would (that isn’t to say we shouldn’t have been vigilant under Clinton, Bush and Obama, all ofwhomlaunched disastrous wars of aggression without a legal basis). If Washington launched anuclear waragainst Russia and China, the bombing alone is estimated to to kill at least 335 million people within the first seventy two hours (this estimate was calculated as far back as 1962, meaning the number is surely higher today). As former Pentagon consultant and whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg once explained, these deaths are merely the beginning: “Well, then I asked, ‘All right, how many altogether’ And a few days later, 100 million in East Europe, the captive nations, another 100 million in West Europe, our allies, from our own strikes, by fallout, depending on which way the wind blew, and, however the wind blew, a third 100 million in adjoining countries, neutral countries, like Austria and Finland, or Afghanistan then, Japan, northern India and so forth — a total of 600 million people. That was a time, by the way, when the population of the world was 3 billion. And that was an underestimate of their casualties — a hundred Holocausts.” These numbers also don’t take into account the number of people who would die gradually and overtime from the aftermath, which would likely surpass the amount killed in the attack itself. If entire cities are destroyed, who will treat the wounded, feed the remaining people, provide shelter, and the like? If right-wingers think the refugee crisis is bad now, they should be doing their utmost to prevent such a catastrophe from ever occurring. Yet, despite these damning figures, a surveyconductedin 2017 suggested that the majority of Americans would approve of a nuclear strike against an adversarial state such as Iran, killing 2 million civilians in the process so as long as it saved American lives in the long run. As it transpires, nuclear weapons have lost the taboo that existed after the horrors of the US attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As Brian Toon, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Colorado bluntly admitted, people today are just not confronting themselves with the facts. “They think nuclear weapons are just big bombs that blow up lots of people,” the professor said, “without considering the way a nuclear conflict – even a ‘small’ one involving some 10 percent of the US arsenal — might poison millions of men, women and children and change the climate enough to starve hundreds of millions.” Former Secretary of State under Donald Trump Rex Tillerson once allegedlycalledTrump a “f***ing moron” when the President had asked three times in a meeting “if we have nuclear weapons, why don’t we use them?” When this proposition was put to Daniel Ellsberg in an interview with Democracy Now! Ellsberg stated that it is not a question of whether or not Trump might use nuclear weapons – he already is. “It’s not a question of whether the president might use them,” Ellsberg stated. “He’s using them the way you use a gun when you point it at somebody in a confrontation, whether or not you pull the trigger…as in NATO. I think the — one of our commanders just said, ‘Oh, we use the weapons every day, every hour of the day,’ which is true. We use them on the hip.” This is not an issue of the recklessness of Donald Trump versus the unknown depths of an unhinged leader of a so-called rogue state like North Korea. We must bear in mind that in all actuality, the US has been using its nuclear weapons supply to achieve its own ends for decades. In the case of Iraq and Libya, most of Washington’s adversaries have concluded that these countries were not attacked because they had weapons of mass destruction or posed any significant threat to the world – but in fact, because they didn’t. Accordingto North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, “[T]he Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson,” which was that Libya’s decision to abandon its weapons programs in 2003, applauded by George W Bush, had been “an invasion tactic to disarm the country.” The same can equally be said about Trump’s recent threats towards Iran, in which he took to his infamousTwitter accountto threaten that “if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.” This isn’t a bully at school threatening a weaker child with violence – we all know what he is referring to. Seeing as Iran doesn’t actually have nuclear weapons, any surviving historians will remember who led the world towards a nuclear holocaust. The current president certainly wears his nuclear weapons supply on his hip, and with crazed advisors like Boltonpushingup voluptuously against his other hip, perhaps the warnings of Renata Dwan and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists should be heeded. As former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevsaidjust two years ago: “In modern world, wars must be outlawed, because none of the global problems we are facing can be resolved by war — not poverty, nor the environment, migration, population growth, or shortages of resources.” In the meantime, the best defence we have is the hope that defiant officers willupholdtheir promise to disobey a presidential order to deliver a nuclear strike.

"1 May, 2019 17:18",Astronomers ‘gobsmacked’ by black hole so powerful it’s dragging space behind it,"An enormous black hole sitting some 8,000 light years from Earth has such a powerful gravitational pull that as it moves it’s literally dragging nearby space along with it, according to new research. Black hole V404 Cygni, an incredible nine times bigger than the sun, is drawing in material from a companion star. As the material streams toward the black hole, it forms a rotating disk around it about 10 million kilometers wide. Researchers from the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) found jets of fast-moving material shooting from this surrounding disk are“wobbling so fast that their change in direction can be seen in periods as short as minutes.” A dancing jet from a#blackholehas been caught on (radio) camera rapidly changing over a matter of hours by ICRAR-@CurtinUniresearchers. Published in@nature, this is the first time a black hole jet has been seen to change direction so fast!https://t.co/h4cKIlWH99@UAlbertapic.twitter.com/ctEfchOPwh “We were gobsmacked by what we saw in this system -  it was completely unexpected,”said Greg Sivakoff, an East Asian Observatory Fellow involved in the research. This strange wobble phenomenon is, according to the team, evidence of one of the effects of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which states that enormous objects like black holes can distort space and time, but the speed of it in this case is striking. “We’ve never seen this effect happening on such short timescales,”saidJames Miller-Jones, who led the ICRAR team. The material is moving so fast, in fact, the astronomers said it’s zooming at a phenomenal 60 percent of the speed of light. The black hole’s orbit is misaligned from that of its companion star, meaning that as the hole pulls on space and time nearby it warps the inner part of its surrounding disk. This distorted or warped portion is then in turn pulled around with the spinning black hole, which creates the wobbling effect observed by the researchers. “You can think of it like the wobble of a spinning top as it slows down, only in this case, the wobble is caused by Einstein’s general theory of relativity,”Miller-Jones explained.

"1 May, 2019 15:44","Top 19 historical oil disruptions, and how No.20 will shock markets","Albert Einstein once wrote that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” Were he alive today, he would be repeating the line to anyone who would listen, especially the reporters on cable news channels such as CNBC. He might add that the world’s policymakers always approach oil market disruptions in the same way: predicting there will be no impact on prices. Einstein would then point out that the policymakers are consistently wrong. A hefty price boost has followed every disruption. The world has experienced nineteen oil market disruptions over the last forty years. In a paper published in March 2018, I chronicled these events and noted that the maximum price increase was predictable. Last Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo initiated the twentieth disruption. The consequences are projected here. Start, though, with the energy policy insanity. In each of the disruptions since 1973, I have noted the following regarding government officials. State Department representatives always say something like“the US Department of State remains in contact with our partners to reduce the risk of supply disruptions. There is sufficient oil supply in the global markets that countries can access.” OPEC officials always spout some version of“the oil market remains well-supplied, with the recent price driven by geopolitics, not fundamentals.” Read more on Oilprice.com: Rosneft sees no oil deficit looming as Iran sanction waivers end Nothing has changed. Last week Reuters offered this quote from the State Department’s Brian Hook, the person running the Iran sanctions program: “There’s roughly a million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude (exports) left, and there is plenty of supply in the market to ease that transition and maintain stable prices,”said Brian Hook, US Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to the Secretary of State, speaking in a call with reporters. Meanwhile, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih toldFinancial Timesthat Saudi Arabia would not boost production immediately, adding that“the market is ‘well supplied’ and inventories continue to rise despite the sanctions against Iran’s oil exports.” Mark Twain is thought to have said that“history does not repeat, but it rhymes.”In this case, it repeats. Policymakers have learned nothing in forty years. The table below lists the nineteen market disruptions. I prepared it in 2018 at a time when Conoco had just used an award of $2 billion granted against Venezuela to seize the latter’s assets in Curacao and when production in Nigeria suffered a disruption. For each event listed, the table shows the start date, the duration, the maximum price increase associated with it, and the percentage loss in supply. I took these data and developed a model that predicted the price increase associated with seventeen of the nineteen disruptions, excluding the Arab Embargo and the Conoco attachment of Iranian assets. The model explained seventy percent of the price variation. The graph below compares the actual and predicted price changes for each disruption. I note here that I based this model on results published in 1982 inOil Markets in Turmoil, a book I wrote while teaching at Yale. The volume provides a quantitative approach to evaluating oil market disruptions. The findings from the model indicate that the current disruption will likely cause prices to increase sixty-six percent at their peak. Roughly speaking, Brent will rise to between $114 and $126 per barrel. This conclusion results from my calculation that the present episode will take roughly two percent of supply from the market. The reduction will come from falling Venezuelan production, which is also subject to US sanctions, the declining Iranian exports, and a modest cut in Libyan exports. The latest issue ofThe Economistwarns that“the risk of an oil price shock is increasing.”The editors are correct. Thinking of the Einstein quote above, I end by paraphrasing the title of a great book by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff:“This time will not be different.” Thisarticlewas originally published onOilprice.com  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"10 Apr, 2019 13:06","Scientists reveal first ever IMAGE of black hole (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)","In a much heralded scientific breakthrough a group of astronomers from the Event Horizon Telescope have unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole. The major announcement was made in simultaneous news conferences in Washington, Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo as the European Commission, European Research Council, and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project detailed the findings of their mission. Despite their enormous mass black holes are extraordinarily difficult to observe. It is impossible to photograph a black hole’s interior, as light that gets too close to its gravitational pull is lost. This point is known as the event horizon. READ MORE: One giant leap for meme-kind: Twitter pokes fun at humanity’s 1st-ever image of black hole ""This is a huge day in astrophysics,""said US National Science Foundation Director France Córdova.""We're seeing the unseeable."" Dr Shep Doeleman explained that they surveyed the Messier 87 galaxy in an effort to be able to picture the“supermassive black hole and its core.”This black hole resides about 54 million light-years from Earth. “We are delighted to be able to report to you today, we have seen .. we have seen and taken a picture of a black hole,”Doeleman said.“Here it is”. Scientists have obtained the first image of a black hole, using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87. The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around a black hole that is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sunpic.twitter.com/AymXilKhKe “What you are seeing is evidence of an event horizon,”he explained.“It is the strongest evidence that we have to date of the existence of black holes.” Doeleman added that the milestone has“verified Einstein’s theory of gravity in this most extreme laboratory”. ""We could have seen a blob... We saw something so true, that really had a ring to it, if you can use that turn of phrase, and it was just astonishment and wonder,”he said. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is made up of dozens of observatories that scan the area around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, named Sagittarius A*, and the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. The mission sought to capture the first ever image of a black hole’s silhouette. Until now, all that we have been able to see are artists’ impressions. Astrophysicist Monika Moscibrodzka explained why the circle around the shadow of the black hole ""is not really a full ring,” and is brighter at the bottom. ""Our models told us immediately that this kind of structure could only be formed if something in the source was rotating,”she said, adding,“It could be the black hole, or the matter around it, or both could be rotating.”The images are not yet sharp enough to work out the speed of the black hole rotation. The scientists gathered the first data in April 2017 using telescopes in the US, Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica. Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the global network. The global network of telescopes has essentially created a planet-sized observational dish. Like this story?

"8 Apr, 2019 14:41",Event horizon: 1st-ever black hole photo to be released in astrophysics milestone (VIDEOS),"A team of 200 pioneering scientists from across the globe is preparing to push the limits of scientific achievement and attempt to answer two key questions: is it possible to photograph a black hole and, if so, was Einstein right? The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is comprised of dozens of observatories that scan the area around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, named Sagittarius A*,  to piece together a silhouette of the black behemoth and provide humanity with its first-ever glimpse of a real black hole (as opposed to an artist’s rendering). The“groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project,”will be delivered in an announcement by the US National Science Foundation on Wednesday, April 10, at 9am EDT (13:00 GMT). Concurrent announcements will be made in Tokyo, Brussels, Taipei, Santiago, and Shanghai. The black hole is 26,000 light years away, making it rather difficult to photograph, which is why the team combined radio telescopes from Chile, Spain, Mexico, Arizona in the US, two observatories in Hawaii, and one in Antarctica to capture the elusive snap. The 200-strong team distributed the surface area of the combined ‘global telescope’ across the planet in order to increase its magnifying power. “More than 50 years ago, scientists saw there was something very bright at the center of our galaxy,”Paul McNamara, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency told the AFP. McNamara added that the bright object has a“gravitational pull strong enough to make stars orbit around it very quickly – as fast as 20 years.”To put that into perspective, our solar system takes 230 million years to orbit the Milky Way. How can we detect a black hole, if by its very definition it does not emit any light? The electromagnetic radiation we use to find black holes doesn’t actually come from it directly.#blackholeFridayImage credit:@ESO, @ESA/Hubble, M. Kornmesser/N.

"12 Mar, 2019 15:22","‘Old & simple is better’: Trump says planes too complex to fly, rejects EINSTEIN as potential pilot","The passenger of arguably the world’s most-famous aircraft,  US Air Force One, Donald Trump is highly concerned that the complexity of modern planes is creating danger as pilots can no longer take control of the plane when needed. The increasing automation of the aircraft industry drew some barbs from US President Donald Trump on Tuesday. On his Twitter account the 72-year-old leader said “airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly” and require“scientists from MIT”rather than pilots. “I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot,”he complained.“I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!” Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are.... ....needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane! The remarks are apparently Trump’s response to the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 in Ethiopia – a second for this new airliner model in less than six months – which killed 157 people. The US aircraft producer is currently trying to cope with worldwide fallout from the disaster, as countries ground local fleets or ban it from their airspace.

"11 Mar, 2019 17:25",Anne Frank Center slammed for ‘comparing’ returning ISIS fighters to Jews fleeing Nazi Germany,"The Anne Frank Center has waded into the debate around ISIS terrorists returning to Germany with an unlikely take, seemingly implying that they deserve the same rights as Jews persecuted by the Nazis. A tweetstorm ensued. The German government announced plans to strip some Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS or ISIL) fighters returning to Germany of their citizenship last week. More than 1,000 Germans left to take up arms for the Caliphate since 2013, and around a third have returned. Another third are believed to be dead, with the rest in hiding or captivity in Iraq and Syria. The decision will apply to adult German nationals with dual citizenship who join the terror group in the future. The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Center – a human rights nonprofit founded by Frank’s father Otto – jumped into the discussion with an unlikely defense of the Islamist militants. “A lot of protest has broken out against”the government’s decision, the center tweeted,“with reference to the Third Reich.” “In fact, the Nazis made generous use of the means of naturalization. In several waves, a total of more than 39,000 people were expelled – especially Jews. As of Nov. in 1941, they automatically lost their citizenship when they crossed the borders of the Reich regardless of whether 'voluntarily' emigrated or deported.” Tatsächlich machten die Nazis großzügig Gebrauch vom Mittel der  Ausbürgerung.

"7 Mar, 2019 14:18",Calling Dr. Strangelove: The threat of nuclear war cannot prevent World War III forever,"Today, humanity is confronted with an ugly paradox in that the world’s foremost peacekeepers are nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. One bad move on the geopolitical chessboard, however, could trigger a global catastrophe. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge On July 25, 1945, in the waning moments of World War II, then US President Harry S. Truman jotted the following words in his diary, “We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world.” But not terrible enough to employ them, it seems. Just weeks later, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese industrial cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, indiscriminately killing some 200,000 civilians in, literally, a flash. Many others died in the years that followed from radiation poisoning and other associated illnesses. If there is a special place in hell for those who would expose the planet to such horrific weapons, Truman must certainly be there. The historic tragedy is not without some dark irony. Albert Einstein, whose theory of relativity spearheaded the development of atomic weapons, was worried that Adolf Hitler would acquire the deadly know-how before the West. This prompted him in 1939 to write aletterto Truman’s predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, advising him to expedite research into nuclear fission. American scientists, working in the secret Manhattan Project, succeeded beyond Einstein’s wildest dreams. The famous physicist,appalledby the devastation visited upon the two Japanese cities, expressed regret over his fateful decision to warn the Americans. “Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb,” he said, “I would have never lifted a finger.” Since then, the world has been forced to live with the knowledge that all life on earth could be quickly extinguished in the event of some mishap or conflict. Yet this knowledge has not stopped most governments from coveting nuclear weapons because they understand this technology is their best life insurance policy, so to speak. Indeed, only the simple-minded could have failed to take away lessons with regards to the West’s top hits list. A brief glance at the candidates designated for US-led regime change – Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and Syria as the most obvious – demonstrated an obvious fact: only unarmed countries need to worry about foreign actors determining their ‘democratic’ future. In marked contrast to those weaker countries that ‘suffer what they must’, members of the nuclear club (US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea, while it is generally recognized that Israel possesses nuclear weapons although it does not officially acknowledge them) can rest easy in the belief that they are safe from outside attack. Lately, however, that self-confidence has been greatly shaken by a spate of dramatic events that have given the entire world pause. The most recent wake-up call came this month with a series of aerial dogfights between Pakistan and India – two countries that possess over 100 nuclear warheads apiece. The incident demonstrated exactly how fast things can spiral out of control, especially when third-party actors i.e. terrorists are involved in the equation. On February 14, the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out a suicide attack on an Indian military convoy in the Pulwama District that killed over 40 soldiers. Less than two weeks later, New Delhi – accusing Islamabad of going soft on terrorism (sound familiar?) –retaliatedby hitting a “terrorist camp” in a Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. Tensions mounted the following day as the Pakistani military carried out airstrikes along the Line of Control (LoC), shooting down two Indian aircraft that crossed into its territory and capturing onepilot, who has since been released.  It is impossible to read such reports without recalling that both Pakistan and India possess nuclear weapons. This places the enemy combatants in a curious position in that they must practice extreme restraint so as to avoid a ‘worse-case scenario’, and we all know what that is. Whether or not the two regional rivals can continue to keep cool heads remains to be seen. Another recent incident involving nuclear powers came as a tragic accident, although no less disconcerting. In September, four Israeli F-16 fighter jets launched a reckless attack on Latakia, Syria that resulted in thedowningof a Russian military aircraft, which was accidentally hit by Syrian ground fire. The incident resulted in the death of 15 Russian crew members, as well as heightened global tensions. The Russian Ministry of Defense accused Israel of deliberately using the Russian aircraft to attract fire in that the Israeli aircraft failed to either change their approach to the intended targets or give Moscow enough time to move the Il-20 to safety. Russian MoD: 3D video of Il-20 downing off Syrian coasthttps://t.co/TYnUB0j20Kpic.twitter.com/5cynnLIxyE Although tensions eventually calmed down between Moscow and Tel Aviv, the incident provided a grim reminder that the world is becoming chaotic to the point where accidents between nuclear powers are increasingly likely. By far, the most disturbing development on the global stage, however, is the spectacle of Washington unilaterally withdrawing from arms control treaties – specifically the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Needless to say, these moves will rekindle the global arms race – a positive development for defense contractors, no doubt, but an unmitigated disaster for everyone else. Most worrisome is that the US is trashing these landmark treaties at the very same time it has built a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, while actively building up its military footprint smack on Russia’s border. Moscow, naturally, has responded in kind, with Vladimir Putin having recentlyunveiledan array of weapon systems that will make US-led NATO think twice about making any aggressive moves against Russia. Judging by such American antics, one almost gets the impression that it believes a nuclear war is somehow a winnable venture. And there are grounds to believe that is the case. According to a 2017report, for example, a panel of Pentagon officials have called on the president to consider a “tailored nuclear option for limited use.” Asdescribedin the National Interest, using low-yield nuclear weapons against an adversary’s conventional forces will “demonstrate that you mean serious business and might be crazy enough to launch an all out nuclear attack.” Judging by what transpired in 1945 against the Japanese, is there any reason to doubt that many people could believe that America is “crazy enough” to do the unthinkable for a second time? With such deranged ideas floating around, it’s no wonder that the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a non-profit group of academics devoted to the study of security issues, said the world is nowperched at“two minutes before midnight” with regards to a nuclear cataclysm due to ongoing events that place the world in “extraordinary danger.” To paraphrase the 1964 black political comedy, Dr. Strangelove, maybe we should all just stop worrying and love the bomb? @Robert_Bridge Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

"7 Feb, 2019 13:38","Repeat after me, protests in Venezuela good, protests in France bad!","Large street protests in both France and Venezuela. Two Presidents with low approval ratings. But only one whose legitimacy has been denied by Western 'democracies' and by the French president himself. is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger.

His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Just when you thought globalist hypocrisy couldn't get any worse, it just did. France and Venezuela have both experienced widespread anti-government protests in recent weeks. These have been fuelled by economic factors and increased financial hardship of the majority. READ MORE:France says it decided to recall its ambassador from Rome after Italy's deputy PM meets Yellow Vests But it's only in Venezuela where the democratically-elected leader, Nicolas Maduro, has been ordered to step down and his opponent, Juan Guaido, has been anointed president. The 'good old democracies' of the US and the EU have been falling over themselves to 'recognise' Guaido. They're simply Mad About the Boy, and mad at Maduro. In France though, it's a very different story. Here it's been the street protestors – les gilets jaunes – who have been besmirched. They're 'populists' (boo, hiss) and there have been claims that the whole thing is being stirred up by Russia (an even louder boo, hiss). Venezuelan people have legitimate grounds for taking to the streets to protest against their president in times of hardship, but the French people do not. No siree! To add insult to rubber bullet injury, Emmanuel Macron, the man who has triggered the biggest protests in France for over half a century, has the gall (no pun intended) to be right at the forefront of thosesupportingan unelected leader in Venezuela, and all in the name of 'democracy.' Gilbert and Sullivan could not have created a more topsy-turvy world. One in which those who bray the loudest about democracy and 'human rights,' are the greatest destroyers of democracy and human rights. Where the most resolute defenders of  'law and order ' in one country are the most vocal advocates of anarchy and setting fire to government buildings in another. Repeat after me: Street protests in Venezuela good, street protests in France bad! Very bad! When it comes to their own populaces, Macron and Maduro seem to be just about equally unpopular if we believe the polls. France, YouGov poll:President Macron Approval RatingApprove: 18% (-3)Disapprove: 76% (+7)Field work: 28/11/18 – 29/11/18Sample size: 1,006 Macron's rating fell as low as 18% in early December, but has surpassed 30% since then. Some 73 percentthinkhe's an authoritarian. In Venezuela in November 63% of people said theysupporteda 'negotiated settlement' to remove Maduro from office. We can say that it's probably true that most people in France and Venezuela want their present leaders out. But the reason why there's international pressure on Maduro but not on Macron to step down is not because of the extent of the economic hardship, the scale of 'human rights abuses' or the numbers out on the streets, but because one furthers the interests of what Greek political philosopher and economist Takis Fotopoulos has called the 'Transnational Elite,' while the other one doesn't. The EU's failure to condemn the human rights abuses of the Macron government speaks volumes. This alarming clip appears to show French police repeatedly smashing an anti-government protester's face into the pavement:pic.twitter.com/QUMXDD8KiM#GiletsJaunes Macron is an ex-banker whose mission to is to 'reform' the French economy on neoliberal lines. On foreign policy he supports 'liberal interventionism' and French troops staying (illegally) in Syria. France is a member of NATO and, since the end of Gaullism, a staunch ally of the US. Maduro by contrast is a former bus driver whose country operates a largely socialistic economy. Its foreign policy is strongly anti-imperialist. Venezuela is an ally of Russia, and not the US. It opposed 'regime change' in Syria. You don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the Transnational economic/political/propaganda/academic and cultural elites, to use Fotopoulos's classification in his book 'The New World Order in Action,' are gunning for Maduro but not for Macron. Macron may be despised by millions of his fellow countrymen but he is not despised (far from it!) by the people who wield the greatest power in the West today. Maduro is. To get their hands on France's assets, the transnational elite need Macron to stay. To acquire Venezuela's assets, and in particularits oil, they need Maduro to go. READ MORE:‘Good for business’: Trump adviser Bolton admits US interest in Venezuela’s ‘oil capabilities’  That could explain why much of the media coverage of the Venezuelan protests has been sympathetic, even if appalling acts of violence are carried out by anti-government protesters, such as theburningto death of a black man in Caracas in 2017 while the coverage of protests in France has been begrudging. The hawks in the Trump administration trying to engineer regime change in Venezuela are being quite candid about their real motives (oil, capital markets & geo-strategic advantage). It's jingoistic liberals who convince themselves that Bolton & Pence want to liberate Venezuelans:https://t.co/rAmvfnsmKR Earlier this week in Britain, we witnessed the grotesque spectacle of an anti-war Labour MP, Chris Williamson, who opposes Western interference in Venezuela, being harangued by Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow for not 'changing sides' and supporting the recognition of an opposition leader as the country's lawful president. Can you imagine someone being attacked in such a way for not supportingJean-Luc Melenchonbeing declared president of France? Of course that's not going to happen. The 'transnational elite' don't want to see Jean-Luc in power, nor Marine Le Pen for that matter. Macron is the 'democratically elected' president and that's the end of that, no matter how many take to the streets to protest. In Venezuela though, Maduro, despite his election victories, is ripe for plucking. We have of course been here before. Lots of times. We can state it as a rule that any leader of a strategically important, resource-rich country who obstructs the hegemonic aspirations of the transnational elite, will be subject to a campaign of demonization and delegitimization, as sure as night follows day. In 2009, we were told that the presidential election in Iran which resulted in a victory for the 'hardline' Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was undoubtedly 'stolen'. It took an ex-CIA man, Robert Baer, to challenge the dominant narrative. ""One of the only reliable, Western polls conducted in the run-up to the vote gave the election to Ahmadinejad — by higher percentages than the 63% he actually received,"" hewrotein Time. If the notion that Nicolas Maduro can no longer be considered the legitimate president of Venezuela because a large number of people oppose him, then, hardly any current leader in the world is 'legitimate.' Put simply, if 'Maduro must go', then so too, by the same logic, must Macron and indeed Donald Trump, who lest we forget did not win the popular vote in the US presidential election of 2016 and presides over a deeply divided country. Furthermore, if 'human rights' are brought into it, what about the 'human rights' of street protesters in France who have subject to quite brutal treatment from authorities? Earlier this year 28-year old Frenchman Hedi Martin was sentenced to six months in jail for calling for a Yellow Vest protest. Hundreds have been arrested in the state-clamp down on dissent. But it's not in Venezuela, so we really shouldn't be paying too much attention. Remember, the real revolution – one that challenges the transnational elite, instead of aiding their cause – will not be televised. And for sure, Macron won't be cheering it.

"18 Jan, 2019 16:08",EU loves British money more than it loves democracy,"The EU's antagonistic stance towards Brexit, which was on show again this week, is not motivated by lofty, internationalist ideals, but by financial factors.

He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 If we don't get the result we want, vote again. Or else we just ignore it. Anyone who still believes the EU supports 'democracy' should reflect on this week's events. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's so-called 'Withdrawal Agreement' was heavily defeated in the House of Commons, with a large number of Brexiteers voting against it. On the same day, European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Prime Minister of Poland, tweeted:""If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"". If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is? The message, was retweeted by, among others, Michel Barnier, the chief EU Brexit negotiator. We all know, by a process of elimination, what Tusk means by the""only positive solution.""That's Britain staying in the EU and sticking two fingers up at the 17.4m people, many of them from the most deprived parts of the country, who voted to Leave. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker meanwhile urged the UK to ""clarify its intentions as soon as possible"", warning that""time is almost up."" I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the@HouseofCommonsthis evening. I urge the#UKto clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up#Brexithttps://t.co/SMmps5kexn It's hard to escape the conclusion that the EU offered Britain such a bad deal because they knew it wouldn't be passed. Then, maximum pressure could be exerted on the UK to reconsider its decision to leave, or at least kick Brexit into the long grass, which is what having a second referendum would do. Right on cue, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, and the front-runner to become Germany's next chancellor after Angela Merkel, has made an '11th hour' plea for Britain to stay in the EU. The emotional plea, which lauds""the legendary British black humour""among other things, comes, appropriately enough, in a letter to the neocon propaganda organ the Times, which supported 'Remain.' The European establishment is desperate for Britain to reconsider Brexit. Internationalist ideals about 'preserving European unity', don't come in to it, this is all about protecting income streams. Consider a few facts. If Britain does leave without a deal, then the EU as an institution would be considerably worse off. The UK has consistently been one of the top three countries that puts most into the EU budget (after Germany and France). It is one of ten countries that putsmoreinto the EU than it gets out. In 2017, the UK's net contributionwas£9bn. If Britain leaves, the EU faces a financial shortfall. In 2016, 16 countries were net receivers, including Donald Tusk'sPoland. Little wonder that he regards Britain staying as""the only positive solution"". The very generous financial remuneration packages of EU officials might also be threatened by British withdrawal. In December, it was reported that the EU's top civil servants would bepaidover €20,000 a month for the first time, and that Tusk and Juncker would see their packages rise to €32,700 a month. Austerity? Not in Brussels, mon ami! The EU is a fabulous gravy train once you are on board. But the gravy train relies on its richest members not leaving, otherwise who's going to foot the bill? If Britain leaves with 'No Deal', it's not just the EU budget which will take a hit. In 2017, EU countriessoldaround £67 billion more in goods and services to the UK, than the UK sold to them. Europe needs full and unfettered access to British markets, much more than Britain needs full and unfettered access to European markets. That's not being 'nationalistic', but simply stating the economic reality. The country that would lose out the most with Brexit is Germany. Britain's trade deficit with Germany is higher than with any other country, even higher than China, whose products are everywhere in our shops! In 2016, the year of the EU referendum, Britain imported around £26 billionmorefrom Germany than it exported. It's no great surprise therefore to see the president of the Federation of German Industries as one of the signatories of the letter to the Times, pleading for Britain to stay! Repeat after me:""We wouldmissBritain as part of the European Union. We would miss Britain as part of the European Union"". We also have to discuss fishing. The other EU countries do extremely well out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides them with access to UK waters. Belgian fleets get aroundhalftheir catch from British waters! Asreportedin the Independent, the Common Fisheries Quota has for the past 34 years given 84% of the cod in the English Channel to France and just 9% to the UK. Overall, EU vessels take out around four times as much fish out of UK waters as British vessels take out of EU waters. Again, you don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the EU doesn't want Britain to leave. If the EU's commitment to democracy was genuine, they would have done everything they could to make sure the referendum result of June 2016 was implemented. But the financial hit of Britain leaving is too high. So, instead they have done everything possible to subvert the democratic will of the people, while at the same time boasting about their commitment to 'democracy.' Good news for democracy: Parliament is proposing EUR 1.8 billion funding for a new Rights and Values MFF Programme. Civil society will be our strongest ally to protect the#RuleOfLaw& fundamental rights across the EU!https://t.co/7UQLP71GMK Of course, the EU is not the only party to blame. The British government, led by a Remainer, and with Remainers holding prominent positions in the Cabinet, has been pusillanimous. Theresa May has shown she is desperate for a 'deal' whereas in fact, the ones who really need an agreement to provide continued unfettered access to lucrative UK markets, are the EU. If the UK government had called Brussels' bluff and announced that Britain would just leave, you can be sure Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and co would have come running with a much better offer. Their (very high) salaries, and the profits of European businesses, depend on it.Follow Neil Clark@NeilClark66 Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"6 Dec, 2018 14:07",New universe theory suggests galaxies float in vast ocean of ‘dark fluid’,"Current scientific theories about the universe only account for roughly five percent of what’s in it. According to a new theory, everything we have observed so far actually floats in a mysterious, theoretical, ‘cosmic soup’. The remaining 95 percent of the universe, we currently believe, is made up of dark matter or dark energy; theoretical entities that we're only aware of because we have observed how their gravity affects things around them. In a recently publishedpaper, Oxford astrophysicist Jamie Farnes has proposed that dark energy and dark matter actually combine to form a “dark fluid” with negative mass that fills the universe. Dark matter theory began development in the 1930s and the more recent dark energy theories began around 1998. These comprise our current version of theStandard Model– also known as the Lambda-CDM model – which is our ‘best guess’ as to what makes up the remaining 95 percent of our universe that we know little to nothing about. Lambda signifies dark energy as a universal constant and CDM stands for Cold Dark Matter. READ MORE: Study reveals reason aliens may be snatching stars & caging them in megastructures Farnes argues that, like other physical forces, gravity may also be polarized. “For example, electric charges (+ and −), magnetic charges (N and S), and even quantum information (0 and 1) all appear to be fundamentally polarized phenomena,”the paper states. It could therefore be perceived as odd that gravitational charges – conventionally called masses – appear to only consist of positive monopoles. Farnes’ new theory is based on the, as yet, hypothetical concept of negative mass, which is permissible under Newtonian physics. Under negative mass, the rules of the game are switched: for example, if you push an object it accelerates towards you. Dark fluid would, at least theoretically, exert negative gravity, pushing things away rather than drawing them in.  With this in mind, the observed and ongoing expansion of the universe might be explained by this ‘negative gravity’ which would then essentially render galaxies of regular matter as ‘air bubbles’ trapped in a cosmos of this dark liquid. READ MORE: Harvard physicists say they know how and, roughly, when the world will end “Previous approaches to combining dark energy and dark matter have attempted to modify Einstein's theory of general relativity, which has turned out to be incredibly challenging,”says Farnes. “This new approach takes two old ideas that are known to be compatible with Einstein's theory – negative masses and matter creation – and combines them together. The outcome seems rather beautiful: dark energy and dark matter can be unified into a single substance, with both effects being simply explainable as positive mass matter surfing on a sea of negative masses.”  “If real, it would suggest that the missing 95 percent of the cosmos had an aesthetic solution: we had forgotten to include a simple minus sign.” Farnes plans to use the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope to compare existing observations of the universe with his own theorized predictions to test whether his dark fluid theory stands up to questioning.

"30 Nov, 2018 14:25","Asteroids, war, economic collapse! Is the world heading for imminent disaster?","Thanks to the internet, we are bombarded 24/7 with news of disasters and impending disasters, to the point of ennui. Are things really as bad as the media and Hollywood say? Or are we headed for a happy techno future? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge The other evening, in search of some entertainment, I stumbled upon a film by Australian director John Hillcoatentitled, The Road (2009). This riveting post-apocalyptic drama focuses on the travails of a father and son as they set out on foot across a devastated American wasteland following some cataclysmic disaster. What motivates the characters to persevere in their impossible journey, which presents them with every sort of imaginable and unimaginable nightmare, is simply the quest for survival. Why anyone would want to survive amid such total devastation is another question. An interesting element of the film is that we are never told what caused so much destruction. All we know is that some overnight event turned America, and possibly the entire planet, into a scorched wasteland. Hillcoat plays on our modern fears that some uncontrollable event, either by force of nature or man-made, is lurking just around the corner, waiting to devour us. The media is certainly culpable for giving life to these fears. By way of a few examples, consider the terrors lurking in deep space. It seems that every month or so NASAdiscoverssome new asteroid or, worse, a gang of asteroids that ""just missed""hitting earth by millions of miles, sparing us yet again the fate of the dodo bird. But if death by asteroid isn't your cup of tea, you may tremble at the thought of the supervolcanobubblingjust below the surface in the US Northwest. Known to scientists as the Yellowstone Caldera, America's largest volcanic system last blew its magna some 640,000 years ago. Volcano watchers are giddy about the prospects of it blowing again in our geologically short lifetime. Although the chance of some such disaster ruining our morning cup of coffee is low, just the possibility that one could occur has gripped our collective imagination. This dark, foreboding view of an unpredictable future is one that tends to dominate Western mentality. A quick glance at the sheer number of dystopian Hollywoodproductionsover the years seems to validate the point. The problem is that we have been conditioned to believe in the inevitability of an Orwellian future that it risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or perhaps Hollywood and the media are serving as our collective conscience, so to speak, warning tinkering humans that we have pushed the boundaries of science and technology too far and are now risking severe consequences - much like the mythical character Prometheus, who was punished for stealing fire from Zeus and giving it to mortals. And perhaps in no other field has mankind pushed the technological envelope further than on the battlefield. If ever there was an event that could literally wipe out the planet in the blink of an eye, WWIII is it. As Albert Einstein once quipped,""I do not know with what weapons WWIII will be fought, but WWIV will be fought with sticks and stones.""Such a grim prophecy may have thus far succeeded in cooling enthusiasm for a global conflict, but it has not thwarted the belief that, in the words of Clausewitz,""war is the continuation of politics by other means."" This type of thinking is no longer realistic unless we are willing to accept the gravest consequences. Consider the dire situation in Syria, where about a dozen different players are now jockeying for position, to understand the incredibly high stakes involved. In one of the latest developments, a Russian reconnaissance plane was accidentallyshot downby a Syrian missile as Israeli fighter jets were conducting an illicit raid on the sovereign Arab Republic. Further tragedy was averted, but the incident brought the overall climate in Syria to an even higher degree of uncertainty. In the past, nations had a tendency to rush into war with great gusto. However, the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the waning moments of WWII had a way of changing our minds on the subject. Yet, at the same time, that cruel lesson has done nothing to curb our willingness to stockpile enough weapons of mass destruction to destroy the planet many times over. What is the answer to this deadly conundrum? The choice seems rather straightforward. Although it will be a tall order, especially given how much money isgeneratedby military expenditure, political leaders must ultimately accept the fact that resorting to military means to resolve global issues is an extinct form of 'politics'. It is a paradox, but the awesome lethality of weapons of mass destruction has made war nearly impossible. Either we accept this fact or understand that humans themselves, together with the planet and its other myriad life forms, will be extinct. It's the simplest choice of all, yet which country would be the first to surrender their weapons? Not all events that result in catastrophe are related to 'acts of God' or military conflict. Consider our current relationship with the so-called 'free market.' Although many argue that this is the best system for organizing the economic affairs of countries, it is occasionally hit by violent downturns that can best be described as disastrous. When such downturns do happen, as was the case with the 2008 financial crisis, it is the""too big to fail""banks and corporations that are generouslybailed outby the government, while the average person is forced to sink or swim for land that seems nowhere in sight. This proving the aphorism that what we really have is 'socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.' Recently, there has been a number of warning signals – including steepdropson Wall Street – that we are once again approaching dangerous times. Former Republican congressman Ron Paul, in a recent interview withCNBC, warned that a massive downturn is inevitable because the US economy is sitting on""the biggest bubble in the history of mankind."" Global debt balloons to all-time high of $164 trillionhttps://t.co/wdWlW5V2w9pic.twitter.com/hmXqDcATbD Earlier, the investor Jim Rogers, pointing to the massive amount of debt in global markets, especially in the US,predictedthat""When we have a bear market again, and we are going to have a bear market again, it will be the worst in our lifetime."" Although these two individuals may be wrong, there can be no doubt that another economic downturn will eventually happen again. So how should we prepare now for the inevitable? Given the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis, it seems imperative that the banks and corporations understand that the government will not be available to cover for their bad business practices. Big bailouts for big business is not the answer. If companies understand that they will go belly up in the next crisis, they will behave more responsibly. At the same time, assurances should be made to average citizens that they will not be left behind if and when the next downturn occurs. Since unemployment always increases as profits on Wall Street decreases, one way to deal with any future market meltdown is to ensure long-term unemployment and medical plans for those affected by any sudden shocks to the system. Perhaps this is the best way to deal with the daily news of impending gloom and doom, which we see from a variety of places from the military battlefield, to the economic battlefield: Let the people know that not only are solutions being sought, but that their best interests are at heart. @Robert_Bridge Think your friends would be interested?

"21 Nov, 2018 10:57",‘God of chaos’: Milky Way star on the brink of massive gamma-ray supernova explosion,"A star 8,000 light years from Earth is on the verge of a huge supernova explosion, which could produce the Milky Way’s first gamma-ray explosion, a dangerous and extremely energetic event. Australian scientists at the University of Sydney discovered the rare ‘God of chaos’ star, which they say could produce the Milky Way’s first known gamma-ray burst, a lethal combination of dust and gas mixed with wind as fast as 12 million km/ph, which is one of the most extreme energetic events after the Big Bang. The researcherspublishedtheir findings in the latest issue of the journal ‘Nature Astronomy’. ‘God of chaos’ is part of a two-star system named after the Egyptian serpentine Apep. Apep comprises of two hot, luminous stars which orbit each other every hundred years or so. Scientists say one of the stars has the perfect conditions to create a gamma-ray burst which has the potential to strip Earth’s ozone from the atmosphere, drastically increasing our exposure to UV light from the sun. READ MORE: Godzilla, Tardis & Einstein: NASA redraws constellations to map gamma-ray sky (IMAGE, VIDEOS) Fortunately, the star doesn’t appear to be aimed at Earth, however researchers say they “can’t be certain what the future has in store” for Apep. “The system might slow down enough so it explodes as a normal supernova rather than a gamma-ray burst. However, in the meantime, it is providing astronomers a ringside seat into beautiful and dangerous physics that we have not seen before in our galaxy,”saidleader of the research group Professor Peter Tuthill. The study was conducted using the Anglo-Australian Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama Desert, Chile, with the help of researchers at the University of Edinburgh, University of Sheffield and the University of New South Wales.

"14 Nov, 2018 12:12",Hillary Clinton has more chance of becoming president of Libya than she does the US,"If the antidote to Trump is Clinton, the antidote to cancer is heart disease, such is the grotesque perversion of democracy in the land of the free. Thenewsthat Hillary Clinton intends to make another run for the White House in 2020 will have sent a chill sliding down the spine of every student of William Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth.’ ""By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes."" Wickedness and Hillary Clinton walk hand in hand. Indeed wickedness is her particular field of expertise, dressed up in the clothes of liberalism. That said, perhaps where she’s concerned it is liberalism dressed up as wickedness, what with it becoming ever harder to distinguish between the two. A creed that sanctifies sanctimony and hypocrisy while vilifying truth and justice, liberalism to paraphrase Einstein is the measles of mankind. And in this Hillary Clinton is merely the most egregious example. She is a woman for whom the world and everything in it is tantamount to a buffet that is useful only to the extent it feeds and nourishes US hegemony. In 2016, her campaign for the White House fell apart at the seams, shorn of credibility as the sheep is shorn of wool, in her case by the shepherd of truth that is WikiLeaks. Corruption, double-dealing, lies and mendacity – you name it she and the Clinton Foundation she runs with her husband were exposed as the acme of it. Laid out in pristine Technicolor in the now infamousPodesta emailswas revealed irrefutable evidence of her and her husband’s tawdry record of avarice, compounded by an obsession with status and power in the face of which even the Borgias would recoil. Even reading the revelations contained in the emails now, two years on, the stench remains strong. The Democratic Party primary was stitched up to ensure that no matter the fact her opponent Bernie Sanders – running on a platform of wealth redistribution and social justice - was much the more credible and viable candidate to run against Trump, he never stood a chance. The Democratic Party machine made sure of it - made sure that the machine woman with the machine heart, that is Hillary Rodham Clinton, got ‘selected’ come what may. In the subsequent campaign, she ran for president with a sense of entitlement the size of the Pacific which went a long way to allowing a man to enter the White House, as the nation’s 45th president, who is more suited to occupying a psychiatrist’s office than the Oval Office. Thewrathshe unleashed in the wake of her humiliating defeat was directed not at the person responsible – herself – but instead at Russia, Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, alleging collusion and conspiracy. The result of this preposterous exercise in deflection was an investigation, headed by former FBI honcho Robert Mueller, into Russia’s non-existent interference in the 2016 election. Known colloquially asRussiagate, Mueller’s investigation has at time of writing turned up zero – nothing, nada – not so much as a sausage of credible evidence of Russian state collusion in Trump’s victory.  And this is regardless of the deployment of considerable resources, taxpayers’ money and effort with the objective of proving such. In aninterviewconducted earlier this year to promote his acclaimed book on the Trump White House - ‘Fear’ – author and award-winning US investigative Bob Woodward revealed that, despite the fact he “looked for it hard” over the two years he spent researching the book, he could find no evidence of Russian collusion in the 2016 US presidential election. So here we have a candidate, Hillary Clinton, shown to be as corrupt and grasping as a huckster peddling fake watches, initiating with the support of an equally corrupt liberal establishment, an investigation that has plunged relations between Washington and Moscow to an all time dangerous low. Even the English language in all its wondrous capaciousness is unable to furnish a word capable of describing such wilful mendacity. What should not be forgotten is that Hillary Clinton’s Olympian propensity for speaking untruth to the masses was exposed well before 2016. In a 2008articlefor Slate magazine in the US – ‘The Case Against Hillary Clinton’ – Christopher Hitchens eviscerates the woman, lifting the rock of her character to reveal the insects beneath. Writes: “What do you have to forget or overlook in order to desire that this dysfunctional clan once more occupies the White House and is again in a position to rent the Lincoln Bedroom to campaign donors and to employ the Oval Office as a massage parlor?” Please do tell: “On a first-lady goodwill tour of Asia in April 1995 - the kind of banal trip that she now claims as part of her foreign-policy “experience”- Mrs. Clinton had been in Nepal and been briefly introduced to the late Sir Edmund Hillary, conqueror of Mount Everest. Ever ready to milk the moment, she announced that her mother had actually named her for this famous and intrepid explorer. The claim “worked” well enough to be repeated at other stops and even showed up in Bill Clinton’s memoirs almost a decade later, as one more instance of the gutsy tradition that undergirds the junior senator from New York.” Here now the clincher: “Sen. Clinton was born in 1947, and Sir Edmund Hillary and his partner Tenzing Norgay did not ascend Mount Everest until 1953, so thestorywas self-evidently untrue and eventuallyyielded to fact-checking.” The Clintons, Obama and their liberal works were the midwife of Trump and his neoliberal chaos begot right-wing populist rage, and if this right-wing populist rage is allowed to beget more neoliberal chaos in 2020 then the American experiment in the cult of the individual will surely give way to a second civil war. For the masses of the poor across America, as well as a world aching to break free of the Empire’s tentacles, the differences between the Republican and Democratic Party wings of this simulacrum of a democracy are close to none at all. As Gore Vidal points out with impeccable aplomb: “One does not bring a measuring rod to Lilliput.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"8 Nov, 2018 14:09",Massive black hole’s spectacular spin ‘may rotate space around it’,"A massive black hole is spinning so fast that it tests the limits of Einstein's theory of relativity and may rotate space around itself, according to a joint study by India's AstroSat and NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The black hole in question is roughly 10 times the mass of the Sun and one of only five with an accurately measured spin rate this fast, close to the speed of light. India's first dedicated astronomy satellite,Astrosat, launched back in 2015, observed the frenetic pace of the black hole, with findings later confirmed by NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory. In order to grasp the wonders of the cosmos and understand its infinite variety and splendor, we must study light across the electromagnetic spectrum.

"19 Oct, 2018 09:09",VR study dramatically increases people’s compassion by making them virtually homeless,"A study that forced participants to experience what it’s like to lose their home has offered strong evidence that virtual reality can pierce people’s cloak of indifference much more effectively than traditional forms of media. The study by Stanford University aimed to examine how relatively new VR technology affected people’s level of empathy. The team conducted two two-month-long studies with more than 560 participants aged between 15 and 88, representing at least eight ethnic backgrounds. When participants were engaged in their seven-minute ‘Becoming Homeless’ VR experience, in which they lost their jobs and homes, the study found that they had longer-lasting compassion compared to those who read about it or saw it on the news. The VR experience led participants through several scenes, including selecting items to sell in their apartment in order to pay rent, finding shelter on a public bus, and protecting their belongings from being stolen by a stranger. READ MORE: Know-how: Canadian hospital first to сure patients with virtual reality “Experiences are what define us as humans, so it's not surprising that an intense experience in VR is more impactful than imagining something,”saidJeremy Bailenson, a professor of communication and a co-author of the paper. The study,publishedin the October edition of the journal Plos One, points out that while VR enthusiasts agree the technology is the “ultimate empathy machine,” that can help people relate to each other better than TV, novels or films; little is still known as to exactly why VR can alter people’s attitudes.  “About 10 million headsets have been sold in the US over the past two years. So, many people now have access to VR experiences. But we still don't know much about how VR affects people,” said Fernanda Herrera, a graduate student in the Department of Communication and lead author of the study. “This research is an important step in figuring out how much of an effect this technology can have on people's level of empathy in the long term,” added Herrera, who also acknowledged that previous studies have never determined the long-term effects of VR on empathy beyond one week. ApreviousVR study carried out by a team of researchers at the University of Barcelona found people who played Albert Einstein in a virtual reality game actually experienced a change in the way they think and choices they made – with some even reaching a higher IQ.

"9 Jul, 2018 22:21",Think yourself smart: Seeing yourself as Einstein could alter your mind,"People who played Albert Einstein in a virtual reality game actually experienced a change in the way they think and choices they made - with some even reaching a higher IQ, a new study has shown. “Virtual reality can create the illusion of a virtual body to substitute your own, which is called virtual embodiment,""saidProfessor Mel Slater of the University of Barcelona.""In an immersive virtual environment, participants can see this new body reflected in a mirror and it exactly matches their movements, helping to create a powerful illusion that the virtual body is their own.” Previous research by Slater and his associates had suggested that the virtual embodiment of someone else can have a significant impact on attitudes and behavior. A studypublishedin the journal ‘Frontiers in Psychology’ in June found participants with low self-esteem scored better in IQ tests when they virtually stepped into the genius’ body. The researchers were keen to take the virtual experiment to the next level, and wondered if the immersive experience could alter cognitive ability. “If we gave someone a recognizable body that represents supreme intelligence, such as that of Albert Einstein, would they perform better on a cognitive task than people given a normal body?”Slater wrote about the inspiration for the new study. READ MORE: Violent tendencies can be ‘zapped’ out of your brain, new research suggests Some 30 young men took part in the experiment. Prior to the VR experience, each man completed three tests to measure their cognitive ability, self-esteem, and bias towards older people.

The study found people with low self-esteem performed better in their follow-up cognitive exam, and all had a reduced bias against older people. The researchers behind the study hope the results can be utilized to better serve students. Especially those with low self-esteem who, they say, have the most to gain by changing how they think about themselves. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"2 Jul, 2018 19:15","'1964, remember that?':  NY private school slammed over plans to racially segregate students","A West Village private school is facing a severe backlash from parents over its policy of segregating students by race. The school has promised to review the practice, but also said parents had been told about it. The $45,485-a-term Little Red School House is facing outrage from parents who are appalled at the idea of segregating children based on race and ethnicity, the New York Postreports. Parents recently learned of the school director Philip Kassen’s plans to put minority middle-school students in the same homerooms starting next school year. The students share classes with their homeroom group for 30 percent of the day. They also became aware that seventh and eighth graders had already been placed in classrooms based on race in the last school year and that this would likely be expanded to sixth grade in September. A number of parents have even reported the racial division appears to already occur from kindergarten onwards.

These kids have been friends since kindergarten and nursery school. They don’t see color so why are you doing this?”one parent told the Post. The school attracts a number of celebrity parents like Christy Turlington Burns, David Schwimmer and Sofia Coppola. Kassen responded to the anger by emailing parents to say the policy would be reviewed. He then said he would get rid of the policy but would keep races as a“critical, but not primary determinant.” Kassen reportedly sent parents an email last week, explaining the race-placement initiative was meant to“create greater opportunities for connection and support.” READ MORE: Was Einstein racist?

I don’t know if I would necessarily send a child to a school that separated by race,”Amanda Uhry, president of Manhattan Private School Advisors, said.“1964, remember that? We had segregation in America. What is this? It’s segregation!” Schools in the US were legally segregated by race, with white and black Americans forced to attend separate schools until after the Brown v. Board of Education court case in 1954. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended other forms of enforced segregation, which came after years of civil rights campaigning. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"15 Jun, 2018 04:35",Israeli MP invokes the supremacy of ‘Jewish race’ in bizarre pro-Netanyahu tirade,"The ‘Jewish race’ is the smartest in the world and possesses the highest human capital, so Israelis ought to be skeptical about the current corruption probes into Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud party lawmaker has claimed. “I can tell you something very basic,”MK Miki Zohar said, during a debate on Radio 103FM on Wednesday, as cited by the Times of Israel:“You can’t fool the Jews, no matter what the media writes. The public in Israel is a public that belongs to the Jewish race, and the entire Jewish race is the highest human capital, the smartest, the most comprehending.” Citing opinion polls showing widespread support for Netanyahu, Zoharsaidthat statistics clearly show that the“Jewish race”is too smart to be fooled by extensive media coverage of the multiple corruption probes. The somewhat clumsy attempt to defend the Israeli PM immediately landed the ruling party member in hot water. Was Einstein racist? Travel diaries reveal shocking truth about physicist’s views on Asians The loud statement about Jewish supremacy struck a nerve with Ahmad Tibi, an Arab-Muslim Israeli politician and leader of the Arab Movement for Change party, who, on Twitter, accused his Israeli counterpart of devising his own racial theory.“An elected official in ‘the Jewish state’ presents: race theory,”he tweeted, along with a portrait of Zohar. נבחר ציבור ב״מדינת היהודים״ מציג: תורת הגזע..pic.twitter.com/g0uGhBpYt7 The Arab politician then followed up with a tweet of him reading Amos Elon’s book “The Pity of It All: A Portrait of the German-Jewish Epoch, 1743-1933,” which outlines how a small minority came to be perceived as a deadly threat to German national integrity. אחרי דברי@zoharm7. רקוויאם גרמני מאת עמוס אילוןpic.twitter.com/I6cmgbhqwJ Zohar hit back, tweeting:“And on the back cover there is a photo of Albert Einstein, another Jew who brought great news to the world.”To which Arab MP replied:“What’s the connection between you and Einstein? It isn’t even a relative relationship.” In an attempt to quell criticism and clarify what exactly he meant to say, Zohar gave an interview to Hadashot TV – but only made his case worse, denying that he’d mentioned the supremacy of the Jewish race, until he was furnished with a recording of his statement. ‘Despicable lie & smear’: Israel fires back at UN’s ‘apartheid regime’ report “The Jewish people and the Jewish race are of the highest human capital that exists,”he then reiterated.“What can you do?

Publishedby Princeton University Press, the diaries date back to 1920s, the time when the famous Austrian physicist was extensively traveling with his wife Elsa. In late 1922 they embarked on a five-and-a-half-month journey to the Far East and the Middle East. They traveled to Singapore, China, Japan, and briefly sojourned in Palestine before concluding the whirlwind tour in Spain. In manuscripts, he apparently never intended to publish, Einstein shared his travel impressions about art, politics, science, philosophy and ultimately, racial equality. In striking contradiction with his later statements, the Nobel Prize laureate wrote down thoughts on racial stereotypes, insisting that some races not only could not equate to others, but were inferior to them. He described the Chinese as“industrious, filthy, obtuse”and“a peculiar herd-like nation,”that, according to Einstein, posed threat to other nations.“It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races,”he wrote.“For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” With the entry going shockingly against Einstein’s reputation of a civil rights advocate, the public release of the diary could have an effect of two black holes colliding.

Ze’ev Rosenkranz, the senior editor of thepublisheddiaries, told the Guardian that Einstein’s diary entries on the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians stemming from their biological background“are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist.” READ MORE: Stephen Hawking's PhD thesis posted online, crashes Cambridge website With many people looking up to Einstein as both a moral role model and one of the greatest physicists of all time who introduced the theory of general relativity, the revelations on what Rosenkranz called“a clear hallmark of racism”could now tarnish the popular science icon.

"14 Jun, 2018 12:54",Dumbing down? New study suggests young people's IQs are in decline,"A new study, conducted by Norwegian scientists, shows that IQ scores of today’s young people are in decline, putting an end to the post-war trend of rising intelligence. After the Second World War young people’s IQs were steadily rising. It was dubbed the Flynn effect after New Zealand intelligence researcher James Flynn. This phenomenon saw average IQ scores rise about three points per decade. But researches from the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research in Oslo say the Flynn effect is now past its peak. In a paper, published in the PNAS journal, Norwegian scientists Ole Rogeberg and Bernt Bratsberganalyzedthe data from standardized IQ tests of about 730,000 men, born between 1962 and 1991, who underwent mandatory IQ tests to join the national service. The study revealed that the IQ points of those tested peaked among those born in 1975, while people born in 1991 scored five points lower. According to the scientists, this shift could be due to many factors, including the way children are brought up and educated. For example there is less drilling in subjects like mathematics and languages and the total amount of time spent watching television or using technology has increased. However, Dr Ole Rogeberg emphasized low IQ should not necessarily be interpreted as stupidity, but rather children adapting to the new reality of digital technology, skills that cannot be so easily accessed or evaluated by a standardized IQ test.

Norwegian researchers analyzed entire families and siblings in an attempt to find any common traits of mental decline, but failed to find any. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"7 Jun, 2018 10:14","Putin: WWIII may be end of civilization, and that should restrain conflicts (VIDEO)","A new world war could become “an end of civilization,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a live televised call-in show. Awareness of this should restrain international powers from engaging in global conflict, he added. While giving his take on the risks of a new global conflict, Putin recalled Albert Einstein.“I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones,""he quoted the world renowned physicist and a Nobel Prize winner. He went on to say that“understating of the fact that World War III could be an end of the modern civilization”should deter the world“from any radical and highly dangerous actions that could [threaten] the modern civilization.” In a reference to the Cold War era, Putin said that“it was a fear of mutual destruction”that has always prevented the international actors from any radical moves and forced them to respect each other. The Russian leader then pointed out that recent US actions – in particular its unilateral withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed with the Soviet Union – are nothing but an apparent“attempt to disrupt this strategic parity.”He argued that Russia needs to develop its own state-of-the-art weapons systems to retain this condition.

"9 May, 2018 11:57",Karl Marx sacrificed logic on the altar of his desire for revolution,"Karl Marx, the committed revolutionary, once proved that the revolution need not happen. What did he do next? Marx was a committed revolutionary, so much so that when reflecting on his life, he said that if he had it all to do over again, he would still be a revolutionary but would not marry, to save his wife from having to suffer the privations of life with him. There were, of course, many committed revolutionaries in the 19th century. What set Marx apart from them all was that he had proven that revolution not only would happen, but had to happen. It was inevitable. And then, one day, he proved, using a significant advance in his own economics, that revolution did not have to happen: that the inexorable force he had believed pushed in that direction was the outcome of a flaw in his own theory. When the flaw was corrected, the force was gone, and not only was revolution not inevitable, it might not even be necessary. How do you think he reacted? He fudged, of course. He distorted his logic to hide the result, while still continuing to use, in all other respects, the blinding new insight that both extended his logic, and revealed the fatal flaw in his earlier beliefs. I can vividly imagine when he came to these revelations, because they are recorded live in his own handwriting. It happened one day in January 1858, as he wrote what became known asThe Grundrisse: the ‘rough notes’ of his re-readings of the great economists as preparation for writing his magnum opus, Capital. By sheer chance, as he was reading Quesnay, Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, and many more, a friend dropped in with Marx’s own annotated copy of his philosopher master Hegel’s treatise Logic. Marx re-read it, and he started doing something he hadn’t done in 13 years: he began to think and write like a Hegelian philosopher. The change in the language is dramatic, like reading the gonzo journalistHunter S Thompsonas he transits from one drug (say, cocaine) to another (marijuana) over a few paragraphs. Until this point, the Grundrisse reprised the dry logic and prose of his adopted Ricardian methodology. Using this logic, years earlier, Marx had answered a question that Ricardo himself had never solved: if everything was bought at its value, and sold at its value, how did capitalists make a profit? Following Smith and Ricardo, Marx argued that the use-value of a commodity played no role in setting its price. Instead, for these classical economists, price was determined by the cost of production.The intersecting demand and supply curves of Marshall were not for them. Decades earlier, they asserted that the long-term cost of producing an item determined the price for which it was sold. Demand, in effect, set quantity only: price was determined by the cost of production. That in turn resolved itself to the amount of labour used to produce something. As Smith famously said: If among a nation of hunters, for example, it usually costs twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days' or two hours' labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one day's or one hour's labour. Ricardo elaborated this slightly, noting that: ""Suppose the weapon necessary to kill the beaver, was constructed with much more labour than was necessary to kill the deer... one beaver would naturally be of more value than two deer."" But these were explanations of relative prices: they were not explanations of how those relative prices enabled capitalists to make a profit. Smith and Ricardo simply assumed that they did: Marx proved that they did, by taking advantage of a unique characteristic of labour. For every other commodity, the buyer bought and got the commodity itself. But for labour, the capitalist buyer purchased labour-time: the capacity to work in a factory for, say 12 hours a day (a typical working day in Marx’s time). What he paid for this was the cost of production of the labourer him/herself: the means of subsistence. But these means of subsistence might only take, say, 6 hours of labour-time to produce. The gap between the amount paid to the worker (equivalent to six hours of labour) and the product enjoyed by its capitalist purchaser (12 hours of labour) was the source of the physical surplus of outputs over inputs generated in production, and this gap was unique to labour. In Marx’s words in 1847: The labourer receives means of subsistence in exchange for his labour-power; the capitalist receives, in exchange for his means of subsistence, labour, the productive activity of the labourer, the creative force by which the worker not only replaces what he consumes, but also gives to the accumulated labour a greater value than it previously possessed. With labour as the only source of surplus, and hence profit, Marx also hypothesized that competition between capitalists would lead to them mechanizing production more and more over time, leading to a higher ratio of machinery to labour (he called it the“organic composition of capital”) and therefore a lower rate of profit. Though he saw seven countervailing tendencies that might slow it down, this“Tendency for the Rate of Profit to Fall”was the inexorable force that Marx thought would lead, first to social conflict, then to the breakdown of capitalism, and finally to the rise of socialism. Whereas others before him had championed socialism as a preferable form of social organisation to capitalism, Marx believed he was the“Scientific Socialist”who had proven that socialism had to come about. And then he re-read Hegel, re-acquainted himself with his dialectical philosophical roots, started writing in dialectical pairs, of foregrounds and backgrounds and unities, and found a far superior way to analyse capitalism. This revolution in Marx's thought was misunderstood by most Marxists. Some ignored it completely, and described it as Marx“coquetting [flirting] with the Hegelian mode of expression.”This is rather like physicists rejecting Einstein because he“coquetted with the quantum mechanics mode of expression”to solve the problem of the photovoltaic effect. Others confused Marx’s approach with the mumbo jumbo of“thesis, antithesis, synthesis.”This is not only virtually impossible to pronounce (you try saying it five times in a row without sounding like Daffy Duck), let alone apply, but also it belongs to Fichte, not to Hegel or Marx. Marx’s dialectic is best abbreviated as“Society-Unity-Foreground-Background-Tension.”Everything exists in a given society, and is a unity in its own right. But society will focus upon one aspect of that unity, bringing it into the foreground. That necessarily pushes the other aspects of the unity into the background. Since the unity can’t exist without its background as well as its foreground aspects, that sets up a tension, which can transform the unity, and perhaps society itself, over time. It’s a philosophy of change, and ideally suited as a foundation approach to analyzing the economy, in contrast to the stale equilibrium foundations of modern neoclassical economics. Marx’s first appreciation of this technique occurs in a two-page-long footnote, which starts with this opening sentence on page 267 of the Penguin edition of The Grundrisse: “* Is not value to be conceived as the unity of use value and exchange value? In and for itself, is value as such the general form, in opposition to use value and exchange value as particular forms of it? Does this have significance in economics?” This insight became the foundation of his economics from this point forward. He could now justify the Classical School argument that commodities exchange at their cost of production. The commodity was the key social unity in capitalism, and it had two aspects, use-value and exchange-value. Capitalism focuses upon exchange value, putting that in the foreground, and use value in the background. The former determines the price paid for a commodity, the latter is what motivates the exchange in the first place: a seller parts with the use-value of a commodity, which he doesn't need, to get its exchange-value, which he wants; the buyer pays its exchange-value and gets its use-value. Marx’s immediate application of this insight was to develop a positive reason as to why labor was the source of profit: rather than relying on how labor differed from all other commodities, he now used what it had in common with them. Normally use-value is qualitative, and exchange-value is quantitative, and the two are incommensurable for that reason alone. But in production, the use-value that motivates the buyer to buy a commodity is quantitative: its capacity to produce other commodities for sale. With both use-value and exchange-value quantitative, there will be a difference between these two“intrinsically incommensurable magnitudes”(Capital I. Ch. 19) that is the source of surplus. Marx's best statement of this in relation to labor was in Capital I itself: “The daily cost of maintaining it [Labour], and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things. The former determines the exchange-value of the labour power, the latter is its use-value. The fact that half a [working] day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day… The seller of labour power, like the seller of any other commodity, realises its exchange value, and parts with its use-value.” He thus had a far more satisfying, positive proof as to why Labour was a source of surplus. But was it the only source? What about machinery as well? In the Grundrisse, when he was still enthralled by his new methodology, he applied it correctly to machinery: “It also has to be postulated (which was not done above) that the use-value of the machine [is] significantly greater than its value; i.e. that its devaluation in the service of production is not proportional to its increasing effect on production.” But Gadzooks! This means that machinery can be a source of surplus as well. And if so, then an increasing“organic composition of capital”has no implications for the levels of surplus and profit: they could go up just as well as go down when production became less labour-intensive. The“Tendency for the Rate of Profit to Fall”disappears. Socialism is no longer inevitable. Marx’s reaction to this shock discovery was to employ verbal gymnastics until such a time that he could fool himself that he had reconciled the two approaches (I’ll spare you the details, but you can check them outhere,hereorhere). He then set about fooling everyone else, and finally declared emphatically—and falsely—that: However useful a given kind of raw material, or a machine, or other means of production may be, though it may cost £150… yet it cannot, under any circumstances, add to the value of the product more than £150. With this false statement swallowed by Marx’s followers, the belief in the inevitability of socialism continued. Accidents of history led to hisRussia’s Bolshevik followersattempting to impose socialism on feudal Russia, and the rest is a very unfortunate history. Marx also ruined his intellectual legacy with this subterfuge. His most fervent followers continue to champion the“Labour Theory of Value,”ignoring what Marx saw as his major advance over Smith and Ricardo. Though Marx’s many political and social critiques of capitalism continue to resonate today, his analytic contribution was to hobble his successors with defending an inane approach to economics that stymies their ability to analyse capitalism, rather than enhancing it. So Marx’s legacies for his first 200 years are very poor indeed. His fallacious pre-Hegelian ideas led to a social experiment with hideous consequences that we are still, to some degree, living with today. His distortion of his own analytic method led his economic intellectual followers to waste their time trying to solve pointless conundrums in the equally pointless Labour Theory of Value. It could have been otherwise. In his own PhD thesis on Hegel’s philosophy, Marx noted that a philosopher could undermine his own work, and that it was the duty of his followers to amend his error: “It is conceivable that a philosopher should be guilty of this or that inconsistency because of this or that compromise; he may himself be conscious of it. But what he is not conscious of is that in the last analysis this apparent compromise is made possible by the deficiency of his principles or an inadequate grasp of them. So if a philosopher really has compromised it is the job of his followers to use the inner core of his thought to illuminate his own superficial expression of it.” In the end, Marx was as human as Hegel: he sacrificed his own logic on the altar of his desire for revolution. Not only his family suffered for that devotion. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"24 Dec, 2017 09:36","Neutron star merger left behind a black hole, study says","A collapse of two neutron stars, which made headlines this year as the first-ever observation of gravitational waves confirmed by other signals, left behind a black hole, further study has revealed. The GW170817 event reported by scientists of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) earlier this year is considered one of this year’s most significant events in astronomy. The gravitational waves detected by LIGO stations coincided with electromagnetic radiation of a wide spectrum, which confirmed that the event causing the waves was a collision of two neutron stars. READ MORE: Spectacular neutron star crash stretched space time by fraction of an inch (VIDEOS) Superdense neutron stars are produced following a supernova, while a collision event between two neutron stars is called a ‘kilonova.’ Further research of the now-famous kilonova, which was observed in August, indicates that the remnant of this merger is most likely a black hole rather than a more massive neutron star. Researchers from Trinity University in Texas, the University of Texas at Austin, and Eureka Scientific analyzed data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to determine what happened after the collision. The data was obtained on December 3 and 6, 2017 – 108 days after the event. The resultsindicate that radio and X-ray emissions were produced at the same source, and that the rising light-curve that followed the merger was likely due to an increase in accelerated charged particles in the external shock. This could be explained either by a more massive neutron star being formed from the merger, or a black hole, according to the scientists. “We show next that if the merged object were a hyper-massive neutron star endowed with a strong magnetic field, then the X-ray luminosity associated with the dipole radiation would be larger than the observed luminosity 10 days after the event, but much smaller than the observed flux at t ~ 100 days. This argues against the formation of a hyper-massive neutron star in this merger,”the study stated. via GIPHY Earlier X-ray data also allowed scientists to rule out the theory that the object was a neutron star, leading them to conclude that “the merged object was most likely a black hole.” The LIGO project revealed to the world at the start of 2016 that it haddetected gravitational waves, confirming Einstein’s Theory of Relativity more than 100 years on.

The note, given to a courier in Tokyo in 1922 during a lecture tour of Japan, was written shortly after the German-born physicist learned that he was to receive a Nobel Prize for his theory of relativity. The story goes that a Japanese courier delivered Einstein a message at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. The courier then either refused to accept a tip, in line with local practice, or Einstein had no small change to hand, so offered him two handwritten notes. Now a descendant of the messenger is selling the notes at auction to the highest bidder. ""Maybe if you're lucky those notes will become much more valuable than just a regular tip,""said Einstein to the messenger, according to the anonymous seller, reports AFP.

"16 Oct, 2017 14:02",Spectacular neutron star crash stretched space time by fraction of an inch (VIDEOS),"The team of scientists from the LIGO and Virgo observatories have confirmed they witnessed both gravitational waves and light coming from the collision of two neutron stars, definitively proving Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.  Hundreds of scientists from 70 observatories on all seven continents – as well as an additional seven space-based laboratories – combined their resources and expertise to analyze the signal detected on August 17 this year. “As these neutron stars spiraled together, they emitted gravitational waves that were detectable for about 100 seconds; when they collided, a flash of light in the form of gamma rays was emitted and seen on Earth about two seconds after the gravitational waves,”the researchers wrote in apress release. The scientific community, using some of the most sensitive machines ever built by humankind, managed to determine that the two dense, dead stars were 200 miles apart before they merged just 100 seconds later, producing ripples in the fabric of space time.

(POLL),"Scientists are set to reveal details of their latest gravitational waves discovery on Monday in an announcement that is shrouded in mystery. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)saidit would unveil new developments in the ongoing search for gravitational waves alongside partner scientists from some 70 observatories, but gave no hints as to what these could be.

"3 Oct, 2017 18:22",‘Win for Einstein’: Nobel Prize winners find gravitational waves in space,"Three US-based scientists won the Nobel Physics Prize for detecting faint ripples flying through space, the gravitational waves predicted a century ago by Albert Einstein. The discovery gives astronomers a a new way to view the universe. “It’s a win for the human race as a whole,”one of the recipients, Cal Tech’s Kip Thorne told AP.“The gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe.” Utah-born Kip Thorne wins the Nobel Prize for physics for his role in detecting gravitational waveshttps://t.co/QsgZYCXAGypic.twitter.com/NyLjiCVCn1 The other recipients were Rainer Weiss, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Barry Barish, also of the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), who were responsible for designing and developing the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). “I view this more as a thing that recognizes the work of a thousand people,”MIT’s Weiss told reporters at the announcement news conference. Scientists won the Nobel Prize for detecting gravitational waves — here's why that matterspic.twitter.com/wr9nFhAPAZ Gravitational waves are extremely faint ripples in space, generated by some of the most violent events in the universe. The waves detected by the Nobel laureates in September 2015 came from the collision of two black holes some 1.3 billion light years away. A light year is about 5.88 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The discovery ushers in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and provides astronomers with a new set of tools to probe the cosmos. Astronomers previously relied on light, x-rays, radio waves, and other types of electromagnetic radiation emanating from objects in space. “Now, astronomers can learn about cosmic objects through the quivers they made in space and time,”Cal Tech saidin a news release. In describing the process to non-experts, the Swiss Royal Academy of Sciences said gravitational waves“are always created when a mass accelerates, like when a ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.” The waves were predicted by Einstein in 1916 as part of his theory of general relativity, which argues that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time, which itself is the four-dimensional way that astronomers see the universe. The prize is“a win for Einstein, and a very big one,”Caltech's Barish told the AP. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

Today, in the era of Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, the neo-McCarthyites ask: ""Are you now, or have you ever been, a guest or pundit on RT or Sputnik?""The wording might be slightly different, (and the background music more in your face), but the aim is the same. Namely, to try and scare people from speaking out against a foreign policy which relies on war and the threat of war, for fear they’ll be branded a Soviet, or Russian 'agent'. A 79-year-old piece of legislation, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, initially passed to counter Nazi propaganda activities before the start of World War Two, is the latest weapon being utilized by the‘Pro-Freedom and Democracy’Imperial Truth Enforcers, in their campaign against news organizations which don‘t toe the line. All genuine supporters of free speech and media pluralism, whether or not they are fans of RT or Sputnik, should be alarmed at recent developments. ‘Unacceptable for a democratic state’: Russian FM spox slams FBI questioning ex-Sputnik stafferhttps://t.co/MJlCYw9NRRpic.twitter.com/Ehb0V59jOf You don’t have to be the owner of a giant magnifying glass or possess the detective skills of Sherlock Holmes to see whose fingerprints are on the’Get RT and Sputnik to register under FARA'operation. You don’t have to be Albert Einstein to understand why they are so keen to tarnish the RT and Sputnik brands. Let’s go back to January 13th. On that day, theAtlantic Council, whose donors include leading US arms companies, NATO, several foreign governments, as well as lobby groups such as AIPAC, posted anarticleon its website entitled‘US Should Require Russia’s RT to Register as Foreign Agent'by one Elena Postnikova, a JD candidate at Georgetown University Law Center and a former DC Events and Outreach Officer at the US government-funded Freedom House. Postnikova’s article of 13th January was republished by Newsweek and the Kyiv Post. Then on 1st September, the Atlantic Council published a longerreportby Ms. Postnikovaentitled‘Agent of Influence: Should Russia’s RT Register as a Foreign Agent?’ The Atlantic Coundil explained: “In Agent of Influence, author Elena Postnikova, not only argues that RT should register with FARA but makes a legal case for it while laying out recommendations for policymakers. At a minimum, RT’s activities warrant a thorough investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ).” The@AtlanticCouncil- funded by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, NATO, Qatar, etc - to demand RT register as a foreign agenthttps://t.co/xL79r8piDm You can just imagine Senator Joe McCarthy punching the air on hearing that last statement, can’t you? In her paper, Postnikova mentions the benefits of the DOJ getting RT to register.""FARA registration means that RT would need to conspicuously label its information as 'distributed by an agent on behalf of the foreign principal' and include these statements on its website, social media accounts, and in all broadcasts.""This would, she says be""warranted to alert the US public about the origin of RT’s information.""Showing that she possesses a fine sense of humor, Postnikova claims that getting RT to register as a‘foreign agent‘would actually boost free speech.""The disclosure would serve the First Amendment by supplementing information about the agent and ensuring that the public is not misled that it represents a disinterested source."" A week after the 1st September publication, the Atlantic Council held aspecial meetingin Washington to discuss the paper (giving a whole new meaning to the phrase‘AC/DC‘). Then a few days after that the news broke that the FBI was getting involved, to question an ex-Sputnik employee called Andrew Feinberg. Feinberg, it was reported, had handed over to the FBI a thumbnail containing hundreds of internal emails and documents. The anti-Russian media crowd couldn’t conceal their excitement. Three days after our@atlanticcouncilpanel and both@rt_comand@sputnikintunder investigation as foreign agentshttps://t.co/GWRelAHm46 Jamie Kirchick, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, who had spoken at the 8th September Atlantic Council panel, and who had been high-fived by other neocons on social media for‘ambushing’RT live on aira few years back, tweeted triumphantly""Three days after our Atlantic Council panel both RT.com and Sputnik under investigation as foreign agents."" If the McCarthyite hawks of the Atlantic Council get their way and the authorities in the US do force RT and Sputnik to register under FARA, under threat of a large fine and/or civil/criminal prosecution, then a disturbing precedent will have been set. FARA wasn’t designed to target bona fide news or press services not directly controlled by foreign governments, so to take action the authorities will have to find that RT and Sputnik aren’t kosher. Of course, claiming that RT and Sputnik are not""proper newsgathering organizations""like CNN and the BBC and that the journalists who work for them are‘fakes’too, is standard fare for War Lobby propagandists and their fart-smelling groupies. If the robotic nature of these smears strikes you, then all you need to do is to turn to Sharyl Attkisson’snew bookThe Smear for an explanation. You can read my review of the bookhere. Having aggressively pushed the case for FARA registration, those responsible are now keen to stress that it’s really no big deal. The Colombia Journalism Reviewran a pieceby one Jon Allsop, entitled‘Concerns over FBI investigation into Russian ‘news’ are overblown.'(Note how‘news’is put in inverted commas). ""FARA doesn’t add up to press censorship in this case: Outlets like Sputnik and RT aren’t conventionally seen as 'the press,' and the law in no way prohibits their activities,""Allsop explained. He cites JamieKirchick, who says""There is no concern about slippery slopes,""but there’s no mention that Kirchick described merely as""a journalist and writer who has covered Russia and the former Soviet Union,""was on the Atlantic Council panel that called for RT and Sputnik to be registered under FARA. In similar fashion, a 9/11 Yahoo report on the Atlantic Council’s demands neglects to mention how the‘Washington think tank’is funded by NATO and the arms industry, and ironically enough given the subject matter, several foreign governments as well. Yahoo story refers to Atlantic Council as a ""think tank."" Strangely omits that its funders include State Department and NATO.https://t.co/NGpa5QwRZ1 The move to get RT and Sputnik branded as‘foreign agents’is being presented by‘mainstream’outlets as a neutral process. In fact, it’s about as‘neutral’as General Franco refereeing a football match between Barcelona and Real Madrid, or The Joker having the casting vote on a jury deciding on whether to indict Batman for speeding. What we are witnessing is a well-coordinated, well-synchronized and well-oiled campaign to marginalize all dissenting views on foreign policy. Mr Clark: Are you now or have you ever been on RT? I think we should be told...so we can... watch you... Think back to November, when a mysterious new anonymouswebsitecalled’Prop Or Not’popped up to publish a list of US news sites which it accused of""reliably echoing Russian propaganda,""and called on the G-men to investigate them for espionage. ‘The List’included RT and Sputnik, but also sites from across the political spectrum with absolutely no connection to Russia. Prop or Not’s blacklist was then promoted as the work of ‘experts’ by the neoconWashington Post. Again you can imagine Senator McCarthy’s whoop of delight. WPost's anon source: this isn't McCarthyism! We just want FBI to investigate US news orgs for pro-Russia espionagehttps://t.co/8cQD8NZ2NZpic.twitter.com/q9aXl26YqK We’ve reached the stage now when, as in the early Fifties, anyone who opposes a hawkish foreign policy is accused of either being in the pay of Moscow, i.e. a Russian agent, or of‘echoing Russian propaganda.'Against the overthrow of the secular, Christian-protecting government in Syria? Then you’re a stooge of Vladimir Putin! It’s not just Donald Trump who’s been smeared in this way, but the likes of Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, and Labour’s left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn too. All you have to do is to say""I want to end the wars and have better relations with Moscow,""and you’ll get the label. And if you want to lose the label? Well, you have to do what the War Lobby demands of you, like sign a bill imposing even more draconian sanctions on Russia, bomb a Syrian air force base, or publicly condemn‘Russian aggression’in Ukraine. The great irony behind all of this is that the’realist’Russian line on foreign policy is far more in tune with public opinion in the US and UK than the actual policies carried out by the neocon influenced US and UK regimes. Russia opposed the illegal invasion of Iraq, which directly led to the rise of ISIS. It’s also stood firmly on the side of government forces fighting ISIS and Al-Qaeda groups in Syria, instead of trying to undermine them, as the West has done. ‘Are you working for RT?’ - State Dept to reporters asking about diplomatic row with Russiahttps://t.co/V0DXDW7gkQpic.twitter.com/WDb9vYUC1S It’s because people reject the fraudulent War Party narrative that people across the world are increasingly turning to networks such as RT and Sputnik which provide a very different perspective on world affairs. These organizations provide a platform to people from the left and the right, who are kept off the‘mainstream’networks because they don’t meet with establishment approval. I remember the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq when programs such as the BBC’s Newsnight trotted out a series of‘think tank pundits’who assured us that Saddam possessed WMDs which threatened the entire world. These‘experts’went largely unchallenged, and we got a disastrous war which led to the deaths of one million people. The cheerleaders for the Iraq invasion would love us to go back to the halcyon days of 2002/3 when they had control of the narrative and could dictate who could and couldn’t appear on television. It was much easier to sell illegal wars to the public without ’pesky’ stations like RT and Sputnik around, much easier to peddle WMDs-style BS, much easier to launch phony‘humanitarian interventions’against the governments of resource-rich independent countries. Fake news and‘foreign agents‘? Physician heal thyself.

"31 Jul, 2017 07:07",Mirror neurons allow us to become one with another human – neuroscientist,"The human brain is what makes us who we are, yet it remains one of the biggest mysteries for humankind. Today’s guest has shed light on one of the deepest mechanisms of our minds – said to be the driver behind empathy. Mirror neurons allow us to feel what other people are feeling. Are humans programmed to be social? Why then is violence so widespread? And how can the latest discoveries about the human brain help cure autism? We ask leading neuroscientist, and the man who discovered mirror neurons, Dr. Giacomo Rizzolatti. Follow @SophieCo_RT  Sophie Shevardnadze:Dr. Giacomo Rizzolatti, it's really great to have you on our program. Giacomo Rizzolatti:Thank you very much. SS:So, let's start from the beginning. You've discovered mirror neurons. They're responsible for people's ability to understand other people's actions, they're responsible for compassion, they're responsible for empathy - so logically, are those little cells in your brain the very thing that make us human? GR:No, it's not true because, actually, also, monkeys have them… mirror is a mechanism which transforms sensory representation into motor representation. So, I go to a bar and see somebody grasping a cup of coffee, I have the same motor representation in my brain - he's grasping coffee. So this mechanism, it's very ancient, it's present also in the monkey and other people - not my group - discovered it in the birds. So, some birds have this mechanism. So then, in humans, it has been enriched and transformed, but it's not exclusive for human beings. SS:So why is it that in humans it actually incites empathy and compassion and not in monkeys? GR:Why humans - I don't know. Certainly, human ""mirror"" mechanism is much more diffused. The best example - because it's difficult to speak about compassion, because what compassion means for animals, it's not clear. The mother loves the small cubs, the small children, even dogs or cats, so some kind of compassion should be present also in animals, but there's something which is typically human - imitation. We are able to imitate and monkeys, even chimps, are unable to do it or do very little. SS:We're going to talk about imitation a bit later in detail, but I still want to get back to how our mirror neurons differ from those of monkeys, or animals, or birds. Is it that our mirror neurons themselves are more developed or is it just that we are more complex creatures? GR:No, we have more... the mirror mechanism is present in many centers, so it's present, for example, in center related to empathy, to emotion and so on. So, I think, in the animals they are much less developed in the sense. The neurons are always the same, they have the same size and so on. But the connections are much diffused and rich in humans. The mechanism, it's flexible. So if you have been born  in the family which is violent and mother doesn't like you, the father beats you - very likely this mechanism will be somehow suppressed, and you also will be a rather bad man. Then, a point which I often stress, is ideology. If you take some ideology, like Nazism, what happened in  Germany, it's terrible during Nazi period, because one of the most civilized countries in the world decided that Jews are not humans, are untermensch - that was the word, and therefore they can be killed and destroyed. So the mechanism - it's very flexible and weak, so ideology should reinforce it. SS:So it can be very fruitful and at the same time very dangerous because it's so volatile? GR:It's always fruitful, but the culture should increase it rather than destroy it. So, it's always fruitful.... SS:But I am saying that it’s so vulnerable, but you can actually... GR:True, it's very vulnerable. If you think that we can also, in the normal life, modulate it - think about policemen - a policeman can be very harsh, but that's good because if the police is too good, it's not a good policeman. The surgeon cuts, sees blood, but he doesn't start crying, because that's his job. So the mechanism can be modulated even in the normal person. But we think about the society. SS:But from what I understand, you, in the basis of everything, believe in the good of the human nature, so you're saying that empathy is a biological trait in person? GR:I think the humans are born essentially altruistic with a strong feeling towards the other. Otherwise the men would never have children, they would throw away... SS:So what you're saying makes all the economy theories wrong, because economists are actually saying that self-interests is what drives humanity, that's the main thing behind it... GR:Not completely true, because if you think about Adam Smith - he's the founder of the liberal economy, and he wrote, before his most famous book which is the Wealth of Nations, in another one about the moral sentiment and he also said that... there's a very nice sentence in which he said: ""although a person can be very egoistic, still, he's sensitive to the state of the other, and likes when the other is happy"". So even in economy there's this idea that it's not only egoism which drives the person. SS:You brought up violence earlier on - when you witness cruelty, or you witness violence, you often empathise with the victim, but you also are mirroring that crime, right? If you're witnessing violence, does that make you, indirectly, the victim of the crime, because you're mirroring the crime? Because, right now, when you turn on TV, all you see is violence: violence in news, blockbusters are violent, video games are very violent - so, it's very important for us, the new generation, and the young generation, to understand to what extent the violence that we don't experience physically on us, but the one we witness, affects our brains - can you explain that to me? GR:I think that essentially, we became used to it, so we don't feel so strongly as it was 20 or 30 years ago. So we see all the time violence on the TV, so it became something which is really ""I don't care so much"". We don't think it's true. It's completely different - we're used to see it in the movie, but we know that it's not true violence. If you see violence in the streets, it will be completely different. There's a very interesting experiment done in Japan, in which they show to children film with violence and then a play with violence, and the fact was that it was completely different - they were really scared when they saw violence in the theater, and they were rather less scared when they saw it in the film. So the real life is different from what we see in the TV. SS:I'm also trying to figure out if violent behaviour in general can contagious. For instance, if you look at the Sandy Hook shooter, who attacked the elementary school in America, police found paper clippings that he have saved from Norway's Breivik who had massacred young people a year before. GR:That is true, but that thing is not only about violence, we tend to imitate behaviour of others. SS:So it's not just violence. GR:It's not just violence. SS:So we can keep on watching Tarantino films? It's okay? GR:Yes. SS:So, what about blind or deaf people? Do they also have mirror...? GR:Yes. SS:How are they actually activated? GR:I done experiment with blind people and they have the mirror mechanism related to audition and to tactile modality. For example, you can recognize many actions by sound, and they recognize it even better than people who have good sight. SS:Because they're more sensitive and it's more developed?... GR:Because they are compelled to use this modality. SS:So, do mirror neurons actually form our perception of art? GR:We know that people who know how to play piano, and they hear music, they have the resonance in their brain which is much more different from the other people. Then, there's a very nice experiment with dancers - so, classical ballet dancers, when they see other people dancing, they have a very strong reaction in their brain, and in the people who are unable to dance, it's very weak. It's interesting that if you see another type of dancing, like capoeira, which is a brazilian type of dancing, for classical ballet dancer - it's nothing. They are naive exactly as me or you. Instead, when capoeira dancer sees somebody dancing capoeira, they have a very strong mirroring effect. SS:What is it so new and groundbreaking about the mirror neurons that we don't already know? I mean, it's obvious that when you see someone eating on TV, you get hungry and when you see someone beating up a child, you get emotional, so what is it so groundbreak about mirror neurons? GR:The groundbreaking in emotion for example - it's easier to understand for normal people - is that I can understand an emotion in two ways - one way, it's cognitive way - for example, I read: ""In Baghdad, 20 people have been killed"", and I say ""Oh, my goodness, it's a pity"", but my heart has not increased beating, my eyes are normal, my blood pressure is normal. Instead, the mechanism we described, is that if I feel pain or I see pain in you, the same neuron activates. So you and me are the same person. It's not a cognitive understanding, I not just understand that you are in pain, but I feel the pain. That's the big thing about the mirror neurons. SS:So do you need to visualize or view something in order to activate that? GR:I recalled, from an earlier,  which is related to emotion. When I have pain, I have a discharge of this neuron. When I see that you are in pain, I have the discharge of the same neurons. That's really, the most strong argument in favor of that you and me are the same, because at this point I feel that you a human being like me, you are not somebody else. Instead, the cognitive fact, it's very cold. I say: ""Oh, my goodness, 20 people have died in Baghdad, pity"" - and I don't care  anymore. Instead, if I see somebody which I like, for example, in pain, it's my pain. We became the same person, in a sense, it's a ""we"", not ""me"". SS:That makes it more clear... GR:That's I think...for people, the same is true for other actions I mentioned earlier about coffee drinking and so  - but about pain and disgust...we have nothing. We have very nice data on laughing, there's a center for laughing, and when you see somebody laughing, the neurons start immediately firing. SS:Can we make an experiment... See, you don't laugh when I laugh? GR:Well, I don't know what happens in my brain, and also your laughing was fake laughing, I think my brain recognizes what's not real laughing. SS:I keep forgetting you're so smart. GR:You know, we call it, ""the politician smiling"", the politician smiles, but only... SS:A fake smile? GR:...with the mouth, but the eyes are still, they are not moving. Instead, with real smiling, you have these muscles contract. SS:So, professor, you wanted to talk about sports, because there are a lot of parallels with the sports and studies showed that young soccer players increased their confidence in their play just by visualising their moves before they do it  - so is thinking is basically same thing as doing it? GR:It's another mechanism. It's very close to mirror mechanism, which is called 'motor imagery'. So motor imagery is the capacity to think about yourself doing action -  but that's the same neurons which are involved in mirroring, they are involved when they think. So, in other words, if I observe you doing that or I think that I'm doing that - the same neurons fire. So, the trainer knows that, and they say ""before play, rehearse inside your brain the action"" - and that's very useful for trainers and for teams. SS:If brain can affect they way you play and your performance - can observing someone lifting weights actually affect your physical shape? GR:Yeah. SS:Really? GR:There is some data, it's not mine, I don’t know if it could be repeated, but if observe somebody lifting, after a while your muscles increase in strength. So, you can do everything... but you know, what is interesting in this field, is that now we are working - also with other group - on what's called ""action observation therapy"". If you have, for example, broken your legs, and then you have a cast - you walk in a strange way. When the cast is out, you still continue to walk in a strange way, you have to get  rehabilitation. If you watch a film and you see that you are walking in a correct way, the same mechanism which you had before is rehearsed and in one week, you are normal. So it's really, almost magic. SS:Can you learn anything just by watching someone else do it or watching a film? GR:Yes, but that's typically not the mirror mechanism, it's the visual learning. So there's also a visual system. SS:I'm just trying to figure out how much this visual system and mirror neurons are related, that's why I'm asking. GR:So if you see action, the mirror mechanism becomes active, if you see an object - no. If you show to me a painting of Rafaello, mirror neurons are not involved, because you see the color, the shape, the elegance of the dresses, but it's not... the mirror mechanism is related to motion, so it's transformation of some movement of somebody in my movement, your emotion - my emotion. SS:Let me ask you a very tricky question, a very girly question, okay, can I ask you something? GR:Okay. SS:Are the mirror neurons responsible just for the parts of the body that you can enact, that change, while visualizing or mirroring? Or - I can watch someone lose weight... GR:Lose weight? SS:Yes, and would I lose weight too, when I see someone exercising like crazy, burning fat - would my fat burn as well? GR:I have no idea! SS:You should think about it. GR:I will think about it. I'll suggest it for the next experiment. SS:Just want to ask you a question as to a person who studies human brain - do brain types vary, like the brain of a genius, is it different in shape than brain of a normal person, for instance? Or a brain of a person who is very good at mathematics, is it different from a brain of a person who's good in music? GR:No, it's not a macroscopic difference, the difference is in the connections. We know the brain of Einstein is not particularly different from the other, so it's the difference in the connections that you have rather than in the size of the brain. At the beginning of the last century, the people were measuring the brains. Then turned out some have big brain, Turgenev had a huge brain, but then also some stupid people also have a big brain. Turgenev had an enormous brain. SS:I want to talk to you about a topic that's very important to me - how the mirror neurons actually possibly shed light on autism. GR:Yeah. Some people over there interpreted mirror neurons as that broken mirror neurons mean autism, which is partially true. Autism is a genetically-determined disease, and there's a moment of your life, in which typically  you must have emotional sentimental input. For normal people, it’s enough what mother is doing normally.  For other people, that's not enough. You, somehow, you are a bit blind to that, so you must have much more stronger emotional input - otherwise the synapses which make a contact with your emotions center will not light up and you don't understand the action of others, and therefore you are unable to understand them. SS:So, mirror neurons are partially explaining... GR:Partially explaining. SS:...Autism. Can they possibly partially also help improve autists? GR:Absolutely. SS:How? GR:By... as I said before - the only way we have now is through giving more stimuli which can increase your social capability. So, the people who work with these children have to spend a lot of time playing, trying to understand what she likes or what he likes. If you do it normally, after a while, you stop, and children remain autistic. But I must say another thing. When we speak about autism, we have to distinguish. There are autistic children who have normal intelligence, or even very high intelligence. There are autistic children who have a very low intelligence. So, the way to treat them is different. In one case you have just to allow them to socialize. In another case, you have to restore this capacity to interact with the other people in addition to socializing. SS:But in general, can you by some exercises or some outside stimulus enhance mirror neurons or develop mirror neurons? GR:The only way we know is doing some motor things - for example, there's a very nice  experiment made in Holland, with children. When a child is unable to walk because he's too slow - if you show other children walking, there's no activity in mirror neurons. As soon as they start walking, at this point, there's a strong activation. So when you learn a new motor ability, you understand much better the motor ability of others, so you increased a number of your mirror neurons. So, for motor action, it's very easy. For emotion - I don't know how to do it. SS:Can you keep your brain healthy? I mean you’re someone who studies it, what do you do, what kind of exercises? GR:Now it's clear that in order to keep your brain healthy, you have to do motor exercises, you have to have social relations, and you have to have intellectual interests. You have these three things - then you don't become old at 60, you become old at 90. You know, what’s very interesting about Alzheimer's, is that if you are people with low education and no interest, you become, very likely, Alzheimer patient when you are 60. If you have a culture, you don't get Alzheimer's when you get very old. That's… there’s also a good explanation. If you have many connections, so even if you lose part of them, you still are sufficient to interact with other people. If you are a poor man with the little culture - when you lose just a few connections, you become nothing. SS:So, if I start playing chess and doing math and exercises... GR:Yeah, very good. SS:Something like that? GR:Yeah, but also exercise. Physical exercise. It's very strange. Why physical exercises increases your mental capacity? But doing some exercises when you are old, it's good. SS:But I have even noticed that when I run, because I run in the mornings, I think twice as fast. GR:Really? SS:Really. GR:Well, one thing which I think... you know, when you play tennis, you feel very well, I play tennis, I feel very well, and why? Because we have substance we call ""endorphins"". When you do exercises, it's like a drug, and artificial drug, it's liberated in the brain and you feel very well - not because you did exercises, but you have this drug. SS:Right now, with all this new technology, information is very reachable. You don't need to read books anymore, you don't need to go to lectures - tap Google and everything you want to know is there in a heartbeat. How does that affect your brain? GR:There are two faces in this story. One face that's certain is that you can learn much faster - you go to your computer and you know everything about Turgenev, just by mentioning him. Before you had to go to library, to take some books... So from this point of view, it's very good. What is very bad is social thing - you often see two lovers which instead of speaking one to the other, everyone has their own telephone and they're talking with another person. Why then stay together? In this sense, the personal relations, they became very subtle and weak. So that's the danger of technology. SS:So do you think just the personal relations, but then don't affect brains, because if you learn fast, you forget fast, no? GR:Well, this I don't know, but certainly you have more information and you learn fast, but for social aspect it's dangerous. Because if you... I have grand children and they spend most of the time playing with the telephone. But they were playing, I don't know... SS:Imagining, reading... GR:Reading, yes. Now it's really terrible, when you somehow have arranged them together, they talk with you, but as soon as you finish it, they go there and have the telephone. Or they play on  the computer... SS:So, in general, do our brains undergo evolution I mean, do they gain certain skills and lose others or no? GR:Well, if you speak evolution in Darwinian terms - no, because we're fixed now. There's no condition to evolve our brain either way. But in cultural terms, of course, it has been big evolution in these 20 years, I think it’s extremely different - the life now with all these electronic devices. SS:So what are the skills that we have lost, except for social interaction? GR:None. Social interaction  we are losing, we are not losing other cognitive functions. SS:Right, professor, thank you very much for this very interesting interview. Hope it wasn't too difficult for you to answer our question. GR:Well it was rather difficult, your questions were rather difficult. SS:Thank you so much and good luck with everything. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"25 Jul, 2017 12:43",Alternative facts: Ivanka Trump called out by Einstein estate for misquote,"A representative of Albert Einstein’s estate is calling out Ivanka Trump for misquoting the nobel prize winning physicist. A quote tweeted by Trump four years ago, which she attributed to Einstein, resurfaced on Twitter Sunday resulting in a social media roasting for the US president’s daughter. ""If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts."" - Albert Einstein#quote#sunday The trolling even attracted the attention of Greenlight – an authorised representative of the Albert Einstein estate, who runs the estate’s official Twitter account. We can confirm that Albert Einstein never said this quote.  Here's a worthy purchase via@PrincetonUPress:https://t.co/FdGWkO1qpzhttps://t.co/eWTUhskgvR Albert Einstein’s Twitter handle confirmed that the mathematical genius never said the famous phrase:""If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts."" The made up quote was attributed to Einstein on sites such asBrainyQuote.comandGoodreads. While the origin of the false quote attribution is unclear, some believe it’sbasedon a quote of Einstein’s that was taken out of context and was, in fact, criticizing those who change facts. The fact that Einstein never said any such thing only makes this tweet that much more perfect.https://t.co/ZCjViO1CpS Twitter users mocked Trump’s inaccurate attribution by tweeting made up quotes and credited them to some famous names of their own.  ""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach: all the damn vampires"" - Emily Bronte ""Dance like no one is watching. Sing like no one is listening. Love like you've never been hurt and live like its heaven on earth."" ~Pol Pot ""Just make up quotes and attribute them to me. The people who support you won't care that you're lying."" - Albert Einstein Of course Ivanka’s tweet is now being viewed in a fresh light following the phenomenon of the“alternative facts”phrase. Coined by Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway in defence of White House statements about the attendance numbers at Donald Trump’s inauguration, the phrase has become inextricably linked to Ivanka’s father’s presidency.

"7 Jul, 2017 13:21",The Hunt for Reddit User: CNN proves it can do investigative journalism,"There are so many disturbing things about the #CNNBlackmail story that it almost hurts the brain to think about them. But one thing is clear. Watching the way CNN reacted to a Tweet involving a fake sport speaks volumes about its current status. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge I’m not quite sure this is what Donald Trump had in mind when he promised to“drain the swamp,”but he may be on to something. All it took was the launch of one asinine tweet to reveal the unsightly underbelly of CNN and send it on a wild goose chase. For those who somehow missed the main event over the weekend, it occurred ringside at a wrestling match in the glory days of the faux sport, a carnivalesque event that serves as a nice metaphor for the fake reality Americans have been forced to inhabit ever since The Donald trounced Hillary in the elections last year. The tweet features Trump clotheslining some guy ringside, smashing him to the ground before pummeling him with a flurry of fake blows (the footage was from a 2007 WrestleMania event). In this updated version, the guy Trump is 'assaulting' has a CNN logo for a head. Life comes at you at a brisk pacepic.twitter.com/zwzi60fhXF CNN, which recently fell under the bus of fake news claims, found nothing humorous about the meme. In fact, so repulsed was the channel by Trump""inciting violence against journalists""that it was moved to do something it hasn't done in a long, long time: It resorted to good ol' fashioned investigative journalism. One day after Trump released the meme seen around the world, CNN proudly reported that it had, with much more ceremony than the moment warranted,""identified the man behind ""HanA**holeSolo,""the original creator of the Trump vs. CNN virtual fight. #FraudNewsCNN#FNNpic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg Reportedlyusingidentifying data that the user posted, CNN""was able to determine key biographical details, to find the man's name using a Facebook search and ultimately corroborate details he had made available on Reddit."" I guess we will all sleep better tonight, knowing this evil meme creator has been put in his rightful place. But I can't help wondering how less chaotic the world would be today had CNN used those pent-up journalistic juices for squashing all those conspiratorial anti-Russia rumors? But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Although ‘Hans’ was sufficiently alarmed by his sudden notoriety to prostrate himself before the gods of mass media,releasinga lengthy public apology, promising not to publish such un-funny anti-CNN memes in the future (it seems Han was also found to have posted on other occasions content of a racial and anti-Semitic nature), CNNstatedthat it“reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” I can't emphasize how bad this is on CNN's part. This is basically ""don't post stuff we don't like or we'll dox you."" Extremely unethical.pic.twitter.com/5bJZIZasH0 It was that line that caused CNN to enter the Internet house of pain, a virtual Coloseum where fools are not suffered lightly. It's not difficult to see why. Here we have a global media powerhouse, rattled to its very foundation by a puerile meme, swinging all eight of its eyeballed tentacles in the direction of a private citizen whose only crime was exerting his First Amendment right to free speech and expression. Worse, the warning shot against 'Hans' came across as nothing short of arm-twisting blackmail,with some misguided kid with his face smashed up against a school locker. By Tuesday, CNN was on the defensive,denyingclaims that it had coerced the Reddit user in any way. ""CNN decided not to publish the name of the Reddit user out of concern for his safety,""a CNN spokesmantoldThe Hill.""Any assertion that the network blackmailed or coerced him is false. The user, who is an adult male, not a 15-year-old boy, apologized and deleted his account before ever speaking with our reporter."" The damage, however, was already done as CNN learned first-hand how difficult it is to change public perception once an idea has been dumped in the public square. Where have we experienced that before? Ironically, CNN-sponsoredfake news, primarily aimed at Russia, which launched the anti-Trump crusade from the beginning, serves as a perfect example as to how difficult it is to 'retract' fake news once it has taken on a life of its own. Now it seems the fake news serpent has traveled full circle, taken on a virtual life of its own, and is now attacking its master. Some would call that 'poetic justice.' I shudder to think what the Founding Fathers must be thinking about America's great experiment with democracy today, with the 'Home of the Brave' going mental over a tweet depicting an American president physically assaulting a CNN logo in a mock-up of a long-gone professional wrestling bout. FYI ""HanAssholeSolo"" just called me.""I am in total agreement with your statement. I was not threatened in anyway.""https://t.co/7se1B8Z29D Of course, we'd have to patiently explain to those esteemed luminaries from a bygone era, the Franklins, Jeffersons and Madisons, about the glories of social media, corporate-controlled media entities, as well as that curious cornerstone of American culture known as 'World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE),' where grown men in crotch-clutching underwear pretend to beat each other up in front of electrified and oddly democratic crowds. We would also have to explain how CNN is being disingenuous for suggesting that Trump's tweet""encourages violence against reporters""since everybody knows 'professional wrestling' is about as real as a 'Three Stooges' episode, where Mo, Larry and Curly slap each other in the face and rap each other over the head with rubber hammers. Similarly, 'professional wrestling' may provoke fits of violent laughter, and perhaps some domestic disturbances as family members attempt to wrestle the remote control away from Dad. Aside from that, however, wrestling ranks far behind Quentin Tarantino, video games and day-time television as a stimulant and precursor for violent behavior. Speaking of""inciting violence,""it would be very hard to top former CNN host Kathy Griffin, who, in a diabolical nod to jihadi traditions,posteda very non-ironic photo of herself holding a blood-soaked severed head - albeit thankfully of the 'Made in China' rubber variety - of President Trump (please imagine the outcry that would have ensured had any 'comedian' pulled the same stunt using a fake Barack Obama head!). Trump was bad. CNN is worse: CNN threatens amateur satirist behind Trump video: make fun of us again and we dox youhttps://t.co/KiKX1Gexyupic.twitter.com/lqpmFHEsYc The irony over the mainstream media's expressedcontemptfor Trump's""violent""tweet is brought out in stark relief when we consider exactly how CNN has helped to bring relations between the United States and Russia to the brink of destruction. Here is the source of real violence. On this point, we'd have to enlighten the Founding Fathers - who lived long before Albert Einstein - about atomic fusion and the existential threat of nuclear war, which could in a single moment of madness annihilate all life on the planet. Forever. By disseminating a veritable flood of fake news about Russia, CNN can thank itself for helping to herald in an age of extreme uncertainty at a time when our tiny, finite planet is littered with the most lethal weapons of mass destruction ever known. The world can ill afford news 'reporting' thatenthuseson behalf of war and hollow yet deadly consequential anti-Russia rhetoric, as opposed to making sure our political leaders act appropriately. Recently, three CNN journalists weresackedfollowing a retracted story that was based on a single anonymous source who connected Anthony Scaramucci, a supporter of President Trump, to a Russian investment fund. CNN published a bad story, pulled it, apologized. 3 journalists quit. That's impressive and decisive action. Yelling ""Fake News"" unfair. This came shortly after two CNN employees fell for the oldest trick in the journalist trade,admittingon a hidden camera that the Russia narrative is“bull**it”and“a big nothing burger.” In other words, all the talk about Russia being responsible for Hillary Clinton's loss and""hacking US democracy""is pure, fat-free rubbish. The more likely scenario is that the Democratic Party, which was basically promised to win the presidency by a misguided Liberal media, are sore sports who cannot handle the fact that they lost to Trump. This is something the mainstream media by and large refuses to even partially consider. This was most apparent in early January, just before Trump's inauguration ceremony, when CNN reported that senior Obama intelligence officials said they hadbriefedPresident-elect Trump on the existence of the so-called“Russian dossier”full of compromising claims about him. The reality, however, was that it was a half-baked farce. As Mollie Hemingway of The Federalistobserved,""the dossier revealed to everyone how unbelievably stupid and shoddy it was. It was a complete joke, more or less. It didn’t make Trump look bad, it made the intelligence chiefs who claimed to be taking it seriously look like a bunch of amateurs."" I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will#MAGA! In fact, CNN missed a great opportunity to prove itself to be more interested in pursuing truth than aligning itself with a political agenda. Instead, it opted to manufacture for mass consumption fact-free reporting designed to make Donald Trump, and Russia, look bad. In the end, such a pathetic display of journalism only backfired on the news organization, which is now trying hard to save its brand amid""fake news""claims. After Trump posted the controversial tweet, RTspokewith New York Observer columnist Andre Walker about CNN's reaction to the Trump tweet. “Why on earth they are interested in attacking a Twitter user, just because he got retweeted by Donald Trump?”he asked.“I think that CNN is extremely upset about the fact that they’ve been caught out for the amount of fake news and lies they’ve put out across the years,”Walker concluded. It seems that in a very short period of time, the US mainstream media is learning the hard way that fake news does not pay. This is certainly something the US Founders would have understood better than anyone. @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"30 Jun, 2017 14:33",11yo British boy has a higher IQ than Albert Einstein & Stephen Hawking,"An 11-year-old British boy has scored higher on an IQ test than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.  The ‘genius’ benchmark is set at 140, and Arnav Sharma, from Reading, passed the notoriously difficult Mensa test with a score of 162 – the maximum possible result one can receive on the paper. Sharma’s score is two points higher than German-born theoretical physicist Einstein and cosmologist Hawking. His mark in the exam, which primarily measures verbal reasoning ability, puts him in the top one percent of the nation in terms of IQ level. According to the Independent, Arnav had done zero preparation and had never seen what a typical paper looked like before taking it. “The Mensa test is quite hard and not many people pass it, so do not expect to pass,”he told the newspaper. “There were about seven or eight people there. A couple were children but the rest were adults. It was what I thought it would be.”Sharma, who is of Indian origin, said he was not nervous before sitting the test. “I had no preparation at all before taking the Mensa exam. It took about 2.5 hours. There were non-verbal questions as well as verbal questions. “It wasn’t that difficult but I had to guess a few questions as there wasn’t much time.” He added:“My family were surprised but they were also very happy when I told them about the result.” Sharma’s mother, Meesha Dhamija Sharma, said it was not until he was two and a half years old that she became aware of his mathematical abilities. “He was counting up to more than 100. That was when I stopped teaching him because I came to know that there is no end to his numbers.” When asked whether there is anyone else in his family with unusually high IQ, she said:“His dad is quite clever as well, but not as clever.” Mensa is one of the most exclusive clubs in the world, with members only able to join if their IQ test results are in the top two percent of the nation. There are currently 20,000 members in Mensa and only 1,500 are under the age of 18. Mensa was founded in 1946 in Oxford by Lancelot Lionel Ware, a scientist and lawyer, and Roland Berrill, an Australian barrister, but the organization later spread around the world. Its mission is to“identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit of humanity.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"26 Jun, 2017 16:57","Russians name Stalin ‘most outstanding’ world figure, Putin ties for second","Soviet leader Joseph Stalin has once again been named the most oustanding world figure by Russians. Vladimir Putin shared second place with poet Alexander Pushkin. Among non-Russians, Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton made the top 20.  Stalin, Putin, Pushkin, and Vladimir Lenin took the top three positions in a Levada Center poll which asked Russians to name the“most outstanding people of all times and peoples.”The pollresultswere published on Monday. The poll surveyed 1,600 people in 137 places across Russia and was in free form – respondents weren’t given any suggestions for answers. Stalin, who has been in the top three in similar polls since 1999, got 38 percent of the votes. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Alexander Pushkin tied for second, with 34 percent each. Lenin came in third with 32 percent. While Stalin, Pushkin, and Lenin have been getting top scores for years, it was the first time the incumbent Russian president made the top three. Peter the Great, Russia’s first emperor and medieval state reformer, came in fourth place with 29 percent of the votes, ranking higher than the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin. Two prominent Russian scientists – Mikhail Lomonosov, one of the founders of Moscow State University, and Dmitri Mendeleev, creator of the periodic table of elements – also made the top 20. Only three non-Russians made the top 20. French leader Napoleon Bonaparte garnered nine percent, followed by Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton, each receiving seven percent. The list closes with the first and only president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who got six percent of the votes. Russian public opinion of Stalin has been improving over the past few years, earlier research from the Levada Center indicates. According to sociologists and political scientists, this is mostly due to Russia’s fight against Nazism in World War II. While the percentage of Russians who respect or admire Stalin remains more or less unchanged, the number of respondents who condemn Stalin’s authoritarian policies and mass political repressions has dropped over the past decade. This is said to be attributed to a decrease in political awareness. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"2 Jun, 2017 12:34",3bn years old & 3bn light years away – but black hole cosmic wave detected in 2017,"Albert Einstein's once-theoretical gravitational waves were detected in January for only the third time in history, scientists announced Thursday. The waves are ripples in space which permeate through time when two black holes smash together to create a supermassive one. Einstein predicted gravitational waves over a century ago but they remained elusive until September 2015 when scientists working with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) picked up the cosmic vibrations. These vibrations are caused when massive celestial objects – in this latest case two black holes – smash together and merge, triggering ripples in space that echo through time and are picked up by LIGO here on Earth. The newly found black hole has the a mass roughly 49 times the size of our sun. The previous two detections, also caused by black hole collisions, had a solar masses of 62 and 21 times that of the sun. These collisions produce more power than is radiated as light by all the stars and galaxies in the universe at any given time. LIGO/Caltech/Sonoma State (Aurore Simonnet) ""We have further confirmation of the existence of stellar-mass black holes that are larger than 20 solar masses – these are objects we didn't know existed before LIGO detected them,""MIT's David Shoemaker, spokesman for the LIGO Scientific Collaborationsaidin a press release. ""It is remarkable that humans can put together a story, and test it, for such strange and extreme events that took place billions of years ago and billions of light-years distant from us. The entire LIGO and Virgo scientific collaborations worked to put all these pieces together,”he added. NASA discovers ‘beating heart’ of distant black hole (PHOTO)https://t.co/OaQX3gpExypic.twitter.com/WrVR6hUyn3 LIGO picked up the latest space-time ripple on January 4 of this year, quickly determining that the collision occurred an astonishing 3 billion light years away, meaning that the vibrations had been travelling for 3 billion years before reaching LIGO’s instruments on our pale blue dot. The theory of gravitational wave fascinates scientists seeking to develop and utilise it in order to discover more about how our universe came into existence. The first detection caused more than a ripple through the scientific community here on Earth and this latest one is a turning point in the relatively new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. “We’re really moving from novelty to a new observational science,”said Shoemaker. LIGO is also on the hunt for other celestial objects, including colliding neutron stars, objects so dense that a single teaspoon of worth of them would weigh 10 million tons (metric) on Earth.

"18 May, 2017 15:33",The Washington Post: America's #1 source of mass hysteria,"The most widely circulated publication in Washington DC, a weapon of mass distribution, has sparked a political firestorm with an unsubstantiated report leveled against - any guesses? - President Donald Trump and his supposed bromance with Putin's Russia. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Dear reader, if that opening summary gives you a sense of déjà vu, you're not alone. We’ve been down this dark road before; it’s not a bad dream. It's just The Washington Post’s latest addition to the steaming compost pile, featuring lies, fabrication and fake news aimed at protecting the Swamp monsters at all cost. ""President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U.S. officials, who said Trump’s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State,""the Bezos-owned Postreported, and bereft of any verifiable sources. Thus was launched the latest salvo in The Post’s non-stop fake news campaign, apparently to compromise the 45th President of the United States to such a degree that calls for his impeachment will be a foregone conclusion (Incidentally, The Post, judging by a Trump hit-piece thatappearedjust one day before the latest bombshell, seems to be at the forefront of that movement). The Post article in question was polluted with subjective comments sprinkled with some half-baked truths:""For almost anyone in government, discussing such matters with an adversary would be illegal. As president, Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law."" via GIPHY First, some fact-checking. Russia is only an""adversary""of the United States to the degree the American media proclaims it to be. After all, Russia has taken upon itself the unenviable task of routing Islamic State in Syria, and with stunning success. Major Syrian cities, like Palmyra and Aleppo, have been liberated from the terrorist yoke. And let's not forget that before Russia appeared on the scene, ISIS somehow found the time to run a profitableoil-export businessthrough a loophole on the Turkish border. What next? ISIS issuing IPOs on Wall Street? Russia put an end to that startup venture in short order. All things considered, one would think Washington would be seeking more""enemies""like Russia, which seems to be Trump’s rationale. Concerning allegations that Trump somehow was wrong to share intelligence with Russia that involved Islamic State, even The Post admitted that""Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets.""Yet, several lines later, it performed a perfect flip-flop into the shallow end, saying:""At a more fundamental level, the information wasn’t the United States’ to provide to others."" Then, to conceal its tracks into the jungle of fake news, The Post was forced to ratchet up the intrigue, alleging that""the partner""who had provided the intelligence (theidentityof the""partner""- like so much in this story - remains a source of speculation)""had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia.""Really? Let's be honest. Would any other US Commander-in-Chief aside from Donald J. Trump be blamed for not sitting on smoking intelligence if it meant thwarting an ISIS attack? Probably not. So why the double-standards when it comes to The Donald? There is another serious matter here that few are mentioning, and that is the identity of these serial leakers. As Trump could be practically heard screaming over Twitter, where is the investigation into these high-level loud mouths? More importantly, why is the media not using more discretion when quoting such sources? Which leads us to the real question: are these“leaks”in reality nothing more than fake news dressed up like bonafide facts? I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community..... Whatever the case may be, the US mainstream media in general and The Washington Post, in particular, are ramping up domestic tensions to levels rarely seen before. The stakes are high. The reason is because Trump refuses to do the bidding of the Deep State, not to mention the 'media industrial complex, which is hell-bent on war in Syria. Proof of that assertion was readily available when Trump bombed a desolate Syrian airfield in early April. Establishment cheerleader Fareed Zakaria led the round-table rabble when he gleefully gushed,“I think Donald Trump became President of the United States”following the Syrian fireworks display. Really, Fareed? All it took was that little rusty hook - the promise of another US military invasion - to drag you over to Team Trump? Now that Trump is showing a willingness to cooperate with Russia, thereby dashing the fantasies of those media warmongers who - like MSNBC anchor Brian Williams getting all misty-eyed at the""beauty of our weapons""- must start reviling him all over again. Since 2013, when the Graham family sold the newspaper to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million in cash, the publication has morphed into some sort of political parody knockoff of the National Enquirer. It's new motto,""Democracy Dies in Darkness,""emblazoned below its title, seems to serve more like a funeral epitaph than any guiding principle that it dutifully follows. Albert Einstein famously defined insanity as""doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.""If so, then a lot of readers of The Washington Post must be insane, unless they are not expecting a different result, which would be fact-based reporting without some political ax to grind. In that case, regular readers of The Post who don't expect different results are not necessarily clinically insane, but rather happily delusional. Since the public has a rather notorious short memory when it comes to news, here’s a quick trip down the Memory Road of WaPo Fake News. 1. Comey goes Begging? After Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, The Washington PostreportedComey had just sought more funds from the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s alleged ties to the Russians. However, apparently, The Post never bothered to ring up the Department of Justice, because as it turned out Comeynever requestedmore funds. 2. DOJ hissy fit? The Post, quoting a“person close to the White House(perchance a lost tourist?),” reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, the man to whom Comey reported,threatenedto resign following the decision to fire Comey. Yet here we have a video of Rosenstein himself denying that he had considered resigning.

Following news of Comey's firing, The Post, apparently in some lame effort to sound like a Saturday Night Live episode,reportedthat Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, was""hidden in the darkness and among the bushes""trying to avoid reporters. When that was proven to be yet anothersteaming pileof horse manure, The Post was forced to add this note to the fake story EDITOR’S NOTE:This story has been updated to more precisely describe White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s location late Tuesday night in the minutes before he briefed reporters. Spicer huddled with his staff among bushes near television sets on the White House grounds, not “in the bushes,” as the story originally stated. 4. Russians turned off the lights?And then there was the time The Postreportedthat a“Russian operation”was responsible for hacking into the state of Vermont’s power grid? The story is still sitting there, in fact, carrying the same scaremongering headline, positioned over yet another Editor’s Note divesting Russian hackers of any blame: Editor’s Note:""An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the US electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of thatso far.The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid."" 5. The Post decides what's fake Finally, the mother of all ironies. The Post’scrown gem of all fake newswas essentially a fake news story blaming Russia – and a host of alternative websites – for spreading fake news. I kid you not. In fact, much of the unfounded hysteria over“Russia hacking American democracy”resulted from a now debunked Post article that used material from a group calledPropOrNot, which, despite proclaiming to gauge the media on behalf of the public, shuns the public spotlight, preferring anonymity. The Post article by one Craig Timberg alleged“a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy...” PropOrNot issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that, in its opinion,""echoed""Russian propaganda. So next we'll be banning echos, I guess. *WaPo's Editorial Note that accompanies the above-mentioned 'scoop' is so lengthy I must, regrettably, refer the reader to The Washington Post to read it online. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that The Post’s latest bit of insanity against Trump and Russia comes at a time when an ongoing investigation into the murder of Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, DC street, has taken a very interesting and disturbing turn. Rod Wheeler, a retired Washington homicide detective and Fox News contributor,saidhis efforts are pointing to Rich having made contact with WikiLeaks before his untimely death. Reward for the killers of Seth Rich is now $130,000https://t.co/KAiNFJusIb Why is this important? Because of all the possible suspects to have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks, thus possibly sidetracking Hillary Clinton's hopes for the White House, it seems that Mr. Rich, who was the Voter Expansion Data Director at the DNC, was far ahead of Russia on that score. Yet US mediascoffedat any attempt to make a connection between Mr. Rich and the DNC leaks, even after WikiLeaks decided in August to issue a US $20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of the young staffer. It's important to note that WikiLeaks never said Rich was the source of the leaked emails. And Washington metropolitan policereportedhis killing was related to a robbery gone awry. Nevertheless, Wheeler's recent comments are raising some eyebrows. In fact, The Washington Post would have performed much more of a public service by examining this story rather than seeing a Russian behind every tree. “My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,”Wheeler said.“I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.” Coincidence or not, The Washington Post story on Trump allegedly passing intelligence to the Russians waspublishedless than an hour after the Seth Rich story broke. Note:On May 16, a story - that this article cited - was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. It reported, based on the findings of a private investigator, that Mr. Rich may have had contact with WikiLeaks.

Researchers working onFrontier Fields, a project aimed at gathering the earliest images of the cosmos, have used the Hubble telescope to capture images of Abell 370 and the distant field of galaxies behind it. Hubble peers across 6 billion light years of space to look at galaxy cluster Abell 370https://t.co/ODuZRF6tRIpic.twitter.com/lJkZhtRuLo Hubble’s picture, which is reminiscent of a beautiful piece of modern art, shows mysterious arcs of blue light bending around hundreds of yellow-white and elliptical galaxies. These arcs are the result of a phenomenon known as 'gravitational lensing',when the collective gravity of the hundreds of billions of stars warps space. The warping bends the light traveling through the cluster and drags it toward Earth.

The massive gravitational field of the foreground cluster produces this phenomenon.” Abell 370 is found in the constellation Cetus, commonly known as the Sea Monster. Light from far flung galaxies takes billions of years to reach Earth, meaning Hubble’s pictures are in fact images of the distant past.

"18 Apr, 2017 18:58",Physicists create mind-bending ‘negative mass fluid’,"US scientists have managed to surprise science geeks across the globe, creating a unique fluid with negative mass – but that actually stands for an object moving forward when pushed back. The creation began inside a lab at Washington State University (WSU), when physicists cooled rubidium atoms to just slightly above absolute zero. This created what is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. When particles are in this state, they move extremely slowly and behave like waves. They synchronize and move in unison as 'superfluid,' which flows without losing energy, according to a WSUpress release. ‘Negative mass’ created at#WSU.https://t.co/wvGP6vwn9w#GoCougs The team of physicists, led by WSU professor of physics and astronomy Peter Engels, then used lasers to slow the particles. This not only made them colder, but also allowed hot, high energy particles to escape like steam – which further cooled the material. ""The lasers trapped the atoms as if they were in a bowl measuring less than a hundred microns across,""the press release states. ""At this point, the rubidium superfluid has regular mass. Breaking the bowl will allow the rubidium to rush out, expanding as the rubidium in the center pushes outward."" Physicists have created a system with 'negative mass': when you push it, it moves toward you. Wild!https://t.co/bUJU1J9KYqpic.twitter.com/oVnvk0C0GC To create negative mass, Engels and his team applied a second set of lasers which kicked the atoms back and forth and changed the way they spin. After this was done, the rubidium behaved as if it had negative mass, so long as it rushed out fast enough. ""Once you push, it accelerates backwards,""said Michael Forbes, who acted as a theorist analyzing the system.""It looks like the rubidium hits an invisible wall."" While the phenomenon of negative mass is not entirely new, it is rarely created in laboratory conditions, according to Forbes. Although matter can have a negative mass in the same way that an electric charge can either be positive or negative, people rarely think in these terms because""the everyday world sees only the positive aspects of Isaac Newton's Second Law of Motion,""the press release states. That is, the world typically only sees objects’ acceleration in the direction they get pushed – not in the opposite direction. According to Forbes, negative mass can be used to explore some of the more challenging concepts of the cosmos, and noted that the""exquisite control""physicists had over the negative mass is paramount. ""This heightened control gives researchers a new tool to engineer experiments to study analogous physics in astrophysics, like neutron stars, and cosmological phenomena like black holes and dark energy, where experiments are impossible,""the press release states.

"6 Apr, 2017 14:17",‘I didn’t feel appreciated’ – Albert Tumenov on his move from UFC to Russian MMA promotion ACB,"After three years and eight fights in UFC, Russian welterweight Albert 'Einstein' Tumenov is signing with his homeland MMA promotion ACB. Talking to RT Sport, Tumenov spoke about his decision as well as future plans and the name of his next opponent. Tumenov, who signed his contract with Absolute Championship Berkut (ACB) in March, was taking part in the media day for the promotion's next event ACB 57 in Moscow, where he spoke exclusively to RT Sport. Ex-UFC Albert Tumenov signs with@ACB_league, as promotion's head Mairbek Khasiev announced on his Instagrampic.twitter.com/ETHvessXRc RT: You fought in UFC for three years, you are ranked in the top 50 in welterweight rankings. Now you’re moving to ACB. Tell us a little more about that move in your career. Albert Tumenov:When UFC called me, I wasn’t home. So my father spoke to them. UFC lowered down my contract. Although we didn’t ask them to pay me more or anything else. We just wanted to keep the same contract. I’ve been in the top category, in the range of 15-20 best fighters. Sometimes there were moments when I wasn’t 100 percent healthy, but I never denied any fight offers. Seems like they didn’t appreciate me. In the time we live in, you want receive the results for your work. And we work hard and we work every day. Three workouts a day. You want to receive something in return. People say that I went to ACB for the money. It’s not that simple. If you don’t feel appreciated that upsets you. I decided to check for other opportunities. And ACB made a good offer. Plus ACB President Mairbek Khasiev is a very decent man. We spoke and came to an agreement in just a few hours.RT: Were there any other offers from other Russian MMA promotions? AT:Yes, one more promotion has made me an offer. I don’t want to mention the name. They made their offer even before the ACB. But I didn’t like the conditions, so I chose ACB. RT: You are only 25. You can compete for a long time still. Do you see the move to ACB as being permanent, or just a break from competing in the UFC? AT:You know, I didn’t plan to leave UFC. But you never know what will happen tomorrow. Now I am focused on competing in Russia. I want to win an ACB belt. Then we’ll see. I don’t intend to return to UFC at any cost. I want to try myself here. I am not making plans other than my current contract with ACB, which is for three fights. I will work according to my contract, and then we’ll see. Публикация от Albert Tumenov Official (@alberttumenov_)Окт 6 2015 в 11:38 PDT RT: Do you think that UFC didn’t offer you a better contract because you not offering any out-of-the-fight show, such as trash talking and other activities on social media? AT:That could be one of the reasons. To be honest, trash talking disgusts me. I tried to go there once. But I realized that it’s not for me. That is not part of the mentality of Russian people. We love to talk less and to do more. And that’s the way I am. I know that fans like that showmanship part. But I think it’s a temporary thing. A solid fighter will get the recognition despite all that. But for now, UFC has a strange policy. Solid fighters can’t get their shots. I don’t think that it’s a good tendency for UFC. RT: How would you rate the welterweight division in the ACB now? AT:Before signing on with ACB I didn’t follow their welterweight division. But when I checked it out, I realized that there are a lot of good fighters. So, I don’t feel relaxed for sure. If you think that you came from UFC and you won’t have any problems fighting in Russian promotion, you are wrong. RT: Is there any information about your first fight in ACB? AT:Yes, there is. I will fight on May 20 in St. Petersburg againstMarcelo Alfaya. RT: What do you know about Alfaya? And how do you rate him? AT:He is very strong physically. He is looking for takedowns and wrestling in his fights. But his last fight was against Beslan Isaev, and I think that the weight difference was significant. Around 10 kilograms (22lbs). Isaev don’t cut that much weight, compared to him. So, I think that was one of his advantages in that fight. But I am not denying the fact that he is a very good fighter. So, I will be well prepared. RT: What about you? What weight do you normally have when you step into the cage? AT:It depends. My walkaround weight is 86 kilograms (190 lbs). I cut it down to 77 kilograms (170 lbs). But the last two fights I didn’t manage to get much of my weight back after the cuts. For example, when I fought Gunnar Nelson in Rotterdam, I had food poisoning. So I couldn’t eat, and I didn’t get anything back. But when everything is fine, I walk in the cage at about 85 kilos (187 lbs). RT: Do you think Alfaya can benefit more from your fight, since you rated higher than him? AT:I was happy, first of all, to get back to the fighting. Of course, everyone wants to face fighters that are rated higher. Obviously, nobody wants to fight newcomers. It’s a good opportunity for him. But I am motivated to make a comeback. RT: You mentioned that you didn’t feel appreciated in UFC. How exactly that was displayed toward you? AT:They promote some fighters. But some guys don’t get any promotion. I can’t say that that it was really that bad for me out there. But for example, they offered me a new contract right after my two losses, so they can give me less money. I don’t complain. Business is business. So, they do whatever is more profitable. I have no problems about that. But it happened, so now I am in a different promotion. RT: What results you are looking to achieve in ACB? AT:First of all, I want to deliver an entertaining show for the fans. As I always do. Even if I am losing. And obviously when I am winning. I will be well prepared for all my fights as I’m looking to get a championship belt in ACB. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"7 Mar, 2017 16:01",NASA to create ‘the coolest spot’ in the universe on ISS,"NASA is sending a toolbox capable of freezing matter to near absolute zero to the ISS, in order to create the coolest spot in the universe – for science. Lasers, a vacuum chamber, and an electromagnetic“knife”– all inside the box – will be used to block the energy of gas particles, slowing them to a near halt, thereleasepublished on the NASA website said. The instruments will be able to freeze gas atoms to a billionth degree above absolute zero,“more than 100 million times colder than the depths of space.” When cooled to extreme temperatures, atoms can form a special state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate, a“superfluid.”In this state, laws of quantum physics come into play, and matter starts acting more like waves or fabric than particles. The‘toolkit’inside the box is called the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL), and was designed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. CAL is now being assembled, and will fly to the ISS this summer. The experiment will be unprecedented, with temperatures at the lowest marks ever. How would this be of use, except, of course, the experiment being – figuratively and literally – the coolest? “Studying these hyper-cold atoms could reshape our understanding of matter and the fundamental nature of gravity. The experiments we’ll do with the Cold Atom Lab will give us insight into gravity and dark energy – some of the most pervasive forces in the universe,”CAL Project Scientist Robert Thompson of JPL said, as cited in the official NASA release. The results of these experiments could also improve technologies like sensors, quantum computers, and atomic clocks used in spacecraft navigation. Thompson estimated that CAL will allow“superfluid”Bose-Einstein condensates to be seen for up to 10 seconds, compared with just a fraction of second on Earth. “If you had superfluid water and spun it around in a glass, it would spin forever. There’s no viscosity to slow it down and dissipate the kinetic energy. If we can better understand the physics of superfluids, we can possibly learn to use those for more efficient transfer of energy,”Anita Sengupta of JPL, Cold Atom Lab project manager, said, as cited in the release. However, the most exciting application could be having better understanding of dark energy, Kamal Oudrhiri of JPL, the CAL deputy project manager, said. About 27 percent of our universe is dark matter, 68 percent dark energy, and about 5 percent ordinary matter, so“it means that even with all of our current technologies, we are still blind to 95 percent of the universe,”he said. “Like a new lens in Galileo’s first telescope, the ultra-sensitive cold atoms in the Cold Atom Lab have the potential to unlock many mysteries beyond the frontiers of known physics.” Nevertheless, it may be too early to become overexcited: researchers said that CAL is now going through a testing phase to ensure that it functions smoothly in space.

"17 Feb, 2017 15:57",Global telescope array to deliver 1st-ever black hole image by 2018,"An array of radio telescopes scattered around the world may soon produce the first-ever image of a black hole. The experiment would also serve as a test for Einstein's theory of general relativity. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project comprises many radio telescope sites scattered around the world, from the South Pole to Chile, Hawaii, and the French Alps. They will all point at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, to observe the surroundings of the supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A* located there. The signals from all the sites would then be combined using a technique called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), which would effectively turn the array into one Earth-sized radio telescope. It would have a resolution of 50 microarcseconds – good enough to see a grapefruit on the surface of the Moon, or the black hole 26,000 light-years away. The EHT won’t observe the black hole directly, because by its nature it doesn’t allow any EM radiation to escape its event horizon, but it would pick up chaotic radio waves emitted by gas and dust particles as they fall on Sagittarius A*. The experiment is to start on April 5-14 and, if successful, would produce the first-ever image of a black hole later this year or in early 2018, reported Science Directreported. The team behind the telescope will be focusing on radio waves with a wavelength of 1.3mm (230 GHz) for the black hole, which gives them the best chance of cutting through the dust cloud around Sagittarius A*. “We've been fashioning our virtual telescope for almost two decades now, and in April we're going to make the observations that we think have the first real chance of bringing a black hole's event horizon into focus,”project leader Sheperd Doeleman from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told the BBC. The image the researchers expect to see is not a bright ring around a dark blob, as one would assume, but rather a crescent. This is because the ‘Doppler effect’ makes light emitted by material moving towards the observer appear much brighter. The team plan to compare their measurement of the shadow cast by the black hole and compare it to the prediction based on Einstein's theory of general relativity. If they find any contradictions, it would disassemble much of our understanding of physics. “As I've said before, it's never a good idea to bet against Einstein, but if we did see something that was very different from what we expect we would have to reassess the theory of gravity,”Doeleman said. “I don't expect that is going to happen, but anything could happen and that's the beauty of it,”he continued.

"30 Jan, 2017 19:51",Life’s just one big… hologram? New study suggests we live in a 2D universe,"‘Substantial evidence’ has been found that everything we see and feel may in fact be be part of a vast illusion, according to a new study from a group of theoretical physicists and astrophysicists. Writing in the journalPhysical Review Letters, scientists in Canada, Italy and the UK came to the conclusion while studying irregularities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - the so-called ‘afterglow’ of the Big Bang. The theory of a holographic universe was first put forward in the 1990s and argues that everything that makes up our 3D reality, from massive stars to tiny atoms, is actually all set in a 2D plain. This model also theorizes that gravity comes from thin, vibrating strings which are actually holograms generated in a flatter universe which create the illusion of having 3D depth. The new study examined huge volumes of data collected by advanced telescopes and sensing equipment to study the ‘white noise’ of the CMB and seek out irregularities. The team claims that this model could help iron out some of the inconsistencies between Einstein’s theory of gravity and quantum physics, which could be explained if the universe was a hologram. Study co-author Professor Kostas Skenderis from the University of Southampton compares the theory to that of watching a 3D movie,Phys.Org reports. The audience perceives that the images have height, width and depth when in reality they are mere projections from a 2D screen.  “We are proposing using this holographic universe, which is a very different model of the Big Bang than the popularly accepted one that relies on gravity and inflation,”saidthe study’s lead author Niayesh Afshordi, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo, Canada. “Each of these models makes distinct predictions that we can test as we refine our data and improve our theoretical understanding – all within the next five years.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

And:""We urge local organizers and speakers to avoid using the names of politicians or adopting 'anti' language as the focus for their Writers Resist event. It's important to ensure that nonprofit organizations, which are prohibited from political campaigning, will feel confident participating in and sponsoring these events."" Thus, real protest is to be avoided, for it is not tax exempt. Compare such drivel with the declarations of the Congress of American Writers, held at Carnegie Hall, New York, in 1935, and again two years later. They were electric events, with writers discussing how they could confront ominous events in Abyssinia, China and Spain. Telegrams from Thomas Mann, C Day Lewis, Upton Sinclair and Albert Einstein were read out, reflecting the fear that great power was now rampant and that it had become impossible to discuss art and literature without politics or, indeed, direct political action.

If you should survive such action, what you have to say about it afterwards is the truth, is necessary and real, and it will last."" Her words echo across the unction and violence of the Obama era and the silence of those who colluded with his deceptions. That the menace of rapacious power -- rampant long before the rise of Trump --  has been accepted by writers, many of them privileged and celebrated, and by those who guard the gates of literary criticism, and culture, including popular culture, is uncontroversial. Not for them the impossibility of writing and promoting literature bereft of politics. Not for them the responsibility to speak out, regardless of who occupies the White House.

Divide and rule, this is called; or identity politics in which race and gender conceal class, and allow the waging of class war.  Trump understood this.

No Shelley speaks for the poor, no Blake for utopian dreams, no Byron damns the corruption of the ruling class, no Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin reveal the moral disaster of capitalism. William Morris, Oscar Wilde, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw have no equivalents today. Harold Pinter was the last to raise his voice. Among today's insistent voices of consumer-feminism, none echoes Virginia Woolf, who described""the arts of dominating other people... of ruling, of killing, of acquiring land and capital"". There is something both venal and profoundly stupid about famous writers as they venture outside their cosseted world and embrace an""issue"".

This was given expression and  reinforced during the two terms of Barack Obama.""I believe in American exceptionalism with every fibre of my being,""said Obama, who expanded America's favourite military pastime, bombing, and death squads (""special operations"") as no other president has done since the Cold War. According to a Council on Foreign Relations survey, in 2016 alone Obama dropped 26,171 bombs. That is 72 bombs every day. He bombed the poorest people on earth, in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan. Where was Meryl Streep when Obama was prosecuting whistleblowers & bombing weddings? (Op-Edge by@DanielleRyanJ)https://t.co/1OAsTmc3de Every Tuesday - reported theNew York Times- he personally selected those who would be murdered by mostly hellfire missiles fired from drones. Weddings, funerals, shepherds were attacked, along with those attempting to collect the body parts festooning the""terrorist target"". A leading Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, estimated, approvingly, that Obama's drones killed 4,700 people.""Sometimes you hit innocent people and I hate that,"" he said, but we've taken out some very senior members of Al Qaeda."" Like the fascism of the 1930s, big lies are delivered with the precision of a metronome: thanks to an omnipresent media whose description now fits that of the Nuremberg prosecutor:""Before each major aggression, with some few exceptions based on expediency, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically... In the propaganda system... it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons. Take the catastrophe in Libya. In 2011, Obama said Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi was planning ""genocide"" against his own people. ""We knew... that if we waited one more day, Benghazi, a city the size of Charlotte, could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world."" ‘Worst mistake as president’:#Obamaadmits he had no plan after#Libyaregime changehttps://t.co/GiVTPvSXke This was the known lie of Islamist militias facing defeat by Libyan government forces. It became the media story; and Nato - led by Obama and Hillary Clinton - launched 9,700""strike sorties""against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. Uranium warheads were used; the cities of Misurata and Sirte were carpet-bombed. The Red Cross identified mass graves, and Unicef reported that""most [of the children killed] were under the age of ten"". Under Obama, the US has extended secret""special forces""operations to 138 countries, or 70 per cent of the world's population. The first African-American president launched what amounted to a full-scale invasion of Africa. Reminiscent of the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century, the US African Command (Africom) has built a network of supplicants among collaborative African regimes eager for American bribes and armaments.  Africom's ""soldier to soldier"" doctrine embeds US officers at every level of command from general to warrant officer. Only pith helmets are missing. It is as if Africa's proud history of liberation, from Patrice Lumumba to Nelson Mandela, is consigned to oblivion by a new master's black colonial elite whose""historic mission"", warned Frantz Fanon half a century ago, is the promotion of""a capitalism rampant though camouflaged"". It was Obama who, in 2011, announced what became known as the""pivot to Asia"", in which almost two-thirds of US naval forces would be transferred to the Asia-Pacific to ""confront China"", in the words of his Defence Secretary. There was no threat from China; the entire enterprise was unnecessary. It was an extreme provocation to keep the Pentagon and its demented brass happy. In 2014, the Obama's administration oversaw and paid for a fascist-led coup in Ukraine against the democratically-elected government, threatening Russia in the western borderland through Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, with a loss of 27 million lives. It was Obama who placed missiles in Eastern Europe aimed at Russia, and it was the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who increased spending on nuclear warheads to a level higher than that of any administration since the cold war - having promised, in an emotional speech in Prague, to""help rid the world of nuclear weapons"". LIVE: NATO Secretary General speaks at Warsaw Summit, day 2https://t.co/Doz1PVpgAm#WSEF16pic.twitter.com/CUZDo3URnS Obama, the constitutional lawyer, prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other president in history, even though the US constitution protects them. He declared Chelsea Manning guilty before the end of a trial that was a travesty. He has refused to pardon Manning who has suffered years of inhumane treatment which the UN says amounts to torture. He has pursued an entirely bogus case against Julian Assange. He promised to close the Guantanamo concentration camp and didn't. Following the public relations disaster of George W. Bush, Obama, the smooth operator from Chicago via Harvard, was enlisted to restore what he calls""leadership""throughout the world. The Nobel Prize committee's decision was part of this: the kind of cloying reverse racism that beatified the man for no reason other than he was attractive to liberal sensibilities and, of course, American power, if not to the children he kills in impoverished, mostly Muslim countries. This is the Call of Obama. It is not unlike a dog whistle: inaudible to most, irresistible to the besotted and boneheaded, especially""liberal brains pickled in the formaldehyde of identity politics,""as Luciana Bohne put it.""When Obama walks into a room,""gushed George Clooney,""you want to follow him somewhere, anywhere.""

Robinson, professor at the University of California, and one of an uncontaminated group of American strategic thinkers who have retained their independence during the years of intellectual dog-whistling since 9/11, wrote this last week: ""President Barack Obama... may have done more than anyone to assure [Donald] Trump's victory. While Trump's election has triggered a rapid expansion of fascist currents in US civil society, a fascist outcome for the political system is far from inevitable... But that fight back requires clarity as to how we got to such a dangerous precipice. The seeds of 21st century fascism were planted, fertilized and watered by the Obama administration and the politically bankrupt liberal elite."" Robinson points out that""whether in its 20th or its emerging 21st century variants, fascism is, above all, a response to deep structural crises of capitalism, such as that of the 1930s and the one that began with the financial meltdown in 2008 .... There is a near-straight line here from Obama to Trump... The liberal elite's refusal to challenge the rapaciousness of transnational capital and its brand of identity politics served to eclipse the language of the working and popular classes... pushing white workers into an 'identity' of white nationalism and helping the neo-fascists to organise them""... The seedbed is Obama's Weimar Republic, a landscape of endemic poverty, militarised police and barbaric prisons: the consequence of a""market""extremism which, under his presidency, prompted the transfer of $14 trillion in public money to criminal enterprises in Wall Street.

In the country with constitutionally the freest press in the world, free journalism now exists only in its honourable exceptions. The obsession with Trump is a cover for many of those calling themselves""left/liberal"", as if to claim political decency. They are not""left"", neither are they especially""liberal"".  Much of America's aggression towards the rest of humanity has come from so-called liberal Democratic administrations - such as Obama's. America's political spectrum extends from the mythical centre to the lunar right. The ""left"" are homeless renegades Martha Gellhorn described as""a rare and wholly admirable fraternity"".She excluded those who confuse politics with a fixation on their navels. While they ""heal"" and""move forward"", will the Writers Resist campaigners and other anti-Trumpists reflect upon this? More to the point: when will a genuine movement of opposition arise?

"9 Jan, 2017 20:28",Bomb threats reported at Jewish community centers in 6 states,"Multiple Jewish community centers in Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Tennessee have been evacuated due to bomb threats. Similar scares in the UK were determined to be hoaxes. The first threat was called in to the Miami Beach Jewish Community Center (JCC) in Florida around 10:45am local time. Within two hours, similar threats were called in to at least three other JCCs in Florida, including one in neighboring Miami, as well as centers in Nashville, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; Wilmington, Delaware; Tenafly, New Jersey; and Rockville, Maryland. Hundreds of people, mostly preschool children, were evacuated from the various buildings; many have since been let back in after police searched the premises. Update:@MiamiBeachPDinvestigating bomb threat received at JCC along Pine Tree Drive. No other locations affected on Miami Beach. Only a handful of people were evacuated from the Miami Beach JCC because it only handles before- and after-school care, law enforcement told WPLG. Miami Beach police quickly searched the building and gave the all-clear to reopen. Within minutes of the Miami Beach threat, however, the Alper JCC in neighboring Miami received a similar phone call. About 450 students and 70 staff members were evacuated due to the bomb scare,  Miami-Dade Fire Rescue told WSVN. The building reopened around 1pm local time. The threat came from a local phone number, WFOR reported. #UPDATE: Alper JCC given all clear after threat prompted an evacuation this morning.https://t.co/BdGJbCd8EC Shortly after, a JCC in Orlando, Florida was evacuated due to a bomb threat, but no explosives were found, according to WKMG. Around 11:30am ET, JCCs in Nashville and Columbia both received phone calls that there were bombs located on the premises. About 100 people were evacuated due to the threat in Tennessee, but the police determined it was a hoax in less than two hours, the Tennesseanreported. “We’ve taken all the necessary precautions that you would in a situation like this,”Mark S. Freedman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Nashville and Middle Tennessee, told the paper. “This is a threat against the entire community,”he added.“Everyone should be aware of that.” In South Carolina, the Columbia Fire Department and the bomb squad searched the evacuated JCC and found nothing, WIST reported. The call to the JCC in Wilmington came in around 11:45am. Four facilities on the campus were evacuated, including the JCC, the Jewish Federation of Delaware, the Albert Einstein Academy elementary school and Jewish Family Services of Delaware, Jewish Federation of Delaware CEO Seth J. Katzentoldthe Wilmington News Journal. The site is not expected to be cleared for hours, according to police. ""While this threat cannot be taken lightly, our community immediately responded to ensure the safety of our children, guests and staff,""Katzen said.""It is reassuring to know we have the ongoing support of our local law enforcement and area businesses who responded in our time of need."" We received a threat to our building, and in an abundance of caution we have evacuated. Authorities are investigating. EVERYONE IS SAFE! Around noon, threats were made to Jewish centers in Jacksonville and Tenafly. The facility in northern Florida was evacuated out of“an abundance of caution,”but everyone was safe and allowed back in the building just over an hour later, the Jacksonville JCC said. Outside New York City, the Tenafly JCC evacuated a preschool, senior center and adult day care facility for people with disabilities as a precaution, WNBCreported. ""We know of NO immediate threat to our JCC, we have made these adjustments as part of our ongoing effort to consistently review our security program and put in place the recommendations of well qualified security professionals,""a neighboring JCC in West Orange, New Jersey, said in an email to its members, according to WNBC. The center enhanced its security procedures, including posting its guard in a more visible location, rotating guards on patrol and installing brighter lighting in the garage. Just outside of the nation’s capital, the JCC in Rockville received a phoned-in bomb threat minutes before noon. About 350 people ‒ including 200 preschoolers, 60 staff members and people attending fitness classes ‒ were evacuated from the building, Michael Feinstein, the executive director of the Rockville JCCtoldBethesda Magazine. “This is the new reality we have to deal with,”he said. The Bender JCC has been safely evacuated due to a phone threat. The building is now closed. We'll re-open once the issue has been resolved. The all-clear was given around 1:30pm local time after  Montgomery County Police and firefighters searched the building. The nearby Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School was not evacuated, Washington Jewish Weekreported. In Britain, bomb threats were made to schools in three London neighborhoods on Monday morning. Nearby, non-Jewish schools were also placed on lockdown while authorities investigated. Police determined the calls were hoaxes; however, the Community Security Trust, an organization that provides physical protection to Britain’s Jews, alerted all Jewish schools in the country, the Jewish Chronicle reported. US federal law enforcement agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the FBI are assisting local authorities at the various JCCs. It is unclear if the bomb threats are linked in any way. @jarantalaI work for Kosher Network International here in Jax(down the street from JCA) we have reports that 20 JCCs have threats Up to 20 JCCs may have received threats, Kosher Network International reported, though it’s unclear if that refers to centers solely in the US or around the world.

"1 Jan, 2017 05:44",The 7 greatest scientific breakthroughs of 2016,"From the discovery of an Earth-like planet to the unraveling of one of the great mysteries of physics, 2016 has been a blockbuster year for scientific breakthroughs. Gravitational waves Perhaps the biggest scientific feat of 2016 was the detection of gravitational waves in the fabric of space-time, from a pair of colliding black holes. The development added more weight to Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. The researchers backed up their findings by repeating the feat a few months later. The discovery was named Physics World Breakthrough of the Year and is hotly tipped to earn a Nobel Prize. READ MORE: ‘New era of astronomy’: Gravitational waves detected for 2nd time, backing up theory of relativity The possible existence of the waves had been one of the biggest mysteries of physics over the past century and was predicted by Einstein in 1916. Their first detection was announced in February 2016. In the collisions studied, the two black holes had many times the mass of the sun and emitted the waves as they spiraled into one another and eventually collided. In the moment of collision, the black holes reportedly released 50 times more energy than all the stars from all the galaxies in the universe were releasing combined. Earth-like planet Proxima b In August, years of scientific research culminated in the confirmation of the existence of a potentially habitable planet orbiting the star closest to our sun. Named ‘Proxima b’, the planet lies in the ‘habitable zone’ of the star Proxima Centauri, a mere 4.2 light years away from Earth. It could potentially sustain life – even future human habitation. READ MORE: Home from home: Scientists may have discovered an Earth-like planet with water However, don’t pack your bags just yet: with current technology, it would take around 137,000 years to reach the planet. Researchers found that Proxima b, which is 1.3 times the size of Earth, could hold water as it is far enough away from its star for liquid to not be gaseous, but not too distant for it to be frozen. It was also found that the planet may be covered in oceans. The discovery lays the groundwork for further exploration and studies to determine the planet’s habitability. ‘First of its kind’ dinosaur discovered The tail of a 99-million-year-old dinosaur, complete with feathers, bones and soft tissue, was found preserved in amber in Myanmar in December. The extraordinary finding is made even more remarkable by the fact that it was discovered by chance, in a market. READ MORE: ‘1st of its kind’: 99 million-year-old feathered dinosaur tail discovered in Myanmar Researchers say that the tail belonged to a young coelurosaur they nicknamed ‘Eva’, whose feathery tail became stuck in tree resin around 99 million years ago, when the dinosaur was about the size of a sparrow. Had the coelurosaur reached adulthood, it would have grown to be slightly smaller than an ostrich. It’s the first time that feathers and skeletal material from a dinosaur have been found in amber. Paleontologist Ryan McKellar said the finding is a“spectacular little glimpse”that provides scientists with a“pathway that gets us to modern feathers”– a particularly useful development as theories on how feathers evolved have long been debated among evolutionary scientists. Four new elements named on Periodic Table Four brand new elements were given names on the Periodic Table (yes, your science textbook is now out of date). Russian, American and Japanese scientists were behind the new additions, called Nihonium, Moscovium, Tennessine and Oganesson. READ MORE: 4 brand new elements discovered by Russian, Japanese & US researchers They are the 113th, 115th, 117th and 118th elements on the table, filling out the seventh row. These were the first additions to the table since 2011, when two elements were added. The new elements, which are all synthetic, were discovered by smashing very light nuclei into each other and tracking the elements left behind in the aftermath. Scientists first synthesized the new elements between 2002 and 2010 and they were added to the table at the very end of 2015. Their new names weren’t approved until the late November. Juno spacecraft reached Jupiter NASA’s Juno spacecraft made record-breaking close contact with Jupiter this year. In July, the spacecraft came within 2,600 miles (4,200km) of the largest planet in the solar system, cruising by at a speed of 130,000 miles per hour (208,000kph).

I’ll skim past the planet at a mere 2,600 miles above the clouds.pic.twitter.com/QJ8u5aJWAF The solar-powered craft is designed to study Jupiter’s structure and intense magnetic field. Scientists hope to shed light on how much water is in the planet's atmosphere. “What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface… We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets,”Scott Bolton, the principal investigator for Juno with the Southwest Research Institute said. The key to longevity? A study found that getting rid of cells that no longer divide could be the key to human longevity. Scientists at the Mayo Clinic found that cells which no longer divide inside our bodies, known as‘senescent cells’,are linked to diseases of old age, such as kidney failure and type-2 diabetes. Disposing of 'cellular litter' could prolong life by up to 35% - study The procedure increased the lifespan of mice by 17 to 35 percent. The drug also delayed the formation of tumors and reduced age-related deterioration of several organs. In addition, the mice looked healthier and had lower levels of inflammation in fat, muscle and kidney tissue. Cells intact, DNA stable: ISS experiment shows Antarctic fungi could survive on Marshttps://t.co/1oyMjC2P4Jpic.twitter.com/FJzBGsqLeE A number of pharmaceutical companies are already working on developing drugs aimed at disposing of cellular waste. Mice created in petri dish In October, reproductive experts hailed a breakthrough as scientists successfully developed living mice from lab-created eggs. Japanese scientists reprogrammed mouse tail cells as stem cells and turned them into eggs in a petri dish. The eggs were then fertilized and the embryos implanted in female mice, which went on to give birth to 11 healthy pups.

The technique could also allow same-sex couples to produce biological offspring. “Although we are a long way from making artificial eggs for women at the moment, this study also provides us with a basis for experimental models to explore how eggs develop from other species, including in women,”the University of Edinburgh’s Richard Anderson said.

"30 Dec, 2016 08:59",'Breakthrough of the year': How gravitational waves now offer 'a new window for astronomy' (VIDEO),"From celebrity deaths to presidential politics, 2016 left many feeling like they have a black hole in their chest. But Shaon Ghosh, a University of Wisconsin postdoctoral researcher, tells RT how this year’s top scientific discovery truly changed how we see the universe. Over 100 years ago, Albert Einstein predicted that gravitational waves would one day be detected from Earth, when he published his theory of general relativity in 1915. Then in February 2016, physicists using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) did just that. Science magazine hasdubbedtheir work the“breakthrough of the year.” Einstein’s theory states that large objects can alter the fabric of space and time, just as a rock causes ripples when dropped into a pool of water. Gravitational waves, or the ripples in spacetime, would be created when two massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars, came into contact. In February, the LIGO scientists detected the gravitational waves while monitoring the emergence of two black holes 1.3 billion light years away, with a combined mass 62 times that of the Earth’s sun,accordingto the Space Reporter. “These waves are extremely weak, very feeble,”said Shaon Ghosh, postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin, in an interview with RT’s Anya Parampil.“To observe them, you need extremely sensitive detectors like the ones we have built in LIGO.” Until February, the existence of gravitational waves was based merely on indirect evidence, but now there is direct evidence. And no wonder scientists are excited, as there have been efforts to detect these waves since 1972, when the first optical interferometer was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This opens a new window for astronomy,”Ghosh said.“Whenever we talk about astronomy, we talk about observing the universe with light, say visible light or x-rays or radiowaves, but this opens up a new way of looking at the universe.” “It lets us look at the parts of the systems or physical phenomena that doesn't emit light,”Ghosh added. “We will also be able to tell how many black holes are there in the universe, in our local universe, how often the systems coalesce and how energetic the systems are,”he continued.

"22 Dec, 2016 09:53",Swedish ‘Dr. Anal’ to continue practice despite controversial massage ‘cures’,"Having earned the nickname Doctor Anal for heralding rectal massage as panacea for all kinds of aches, a controversial Scandinavian physician has successfully appealed the latest decision to revoke his license. The story of the controversial medic, who earned the media moniker Doctor Anal, has been hitting headiness over the past two decades. His most discussed case was a 2003 case when he treated an elderly woman’s back pain and headache with the anal massage. The woman said the treatment was“an incredibly offensive encroachment.” When Swedish Medical Board of Responsibility (HSAN) started investigating the matter, it turned out that the doctor had done up to 1,000 similar penetrations, all with“very good results,”according to the fine-fingered physician himself. HSAN called the treatment“dubious for a number of reasons,”saying that the massage couldn’t reach the muscles which need to be relaxed. However, Doctor Anal was allowed to continue to practice medicine after appealing to the courts in 2008. Not all of Doctor Anal’s treatments have gone well, though. He eventually got his license revoked in Denmark in July 2015, after piercing a patient’s lung during an anesthetic injection. This prompted HSAN to revoke his license as well, in March 2016, based on a clause in the Patient Safety Act. The doctor appealed the HSAN decision in the Stockholm Administrative Court, saying that the clause wasn’t applicable. The HSAN ruling then was recognized as invalid, Swedish Dagens Nyheter newspaperreportedon Wednesday. Thus, the controversial physician is free to practice in Sweden – however, he was still forced to quit his last place of work in the eastern Swedish town of Norrtälje, after he was recognized as the notorious Doctor Anal. He isn’t welcome in neighboring Norway, either – he was fired there back in 2006 after his dubious track record was discovered. The doctor himself has described the probes as a witch hunt, all the while defending his technique as successful. Back in 2006, Doctor Anal spoke to Aftonbladet newspaper, saying he is misunderstood by the public. “I have a personality disorder, or rather a syndrome, a form of Asperger’s. Just like Bill Gates or Einstein, for example,”hesaid.“I have made it impossible for myself within the healthcare sector because I behave childishly sometimes. I am different, but cleverer.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more.

"29 Nov, 2016 17:50",Einstein’s not so bright idea? Researchers challenge speed of light theory,"Albert Einstein’s theory that light travels at a constant speed in the vacuum of space is being challenged by researchers who propose that the physicist may have got it wrong. They believe light traveled much faster after the big bang. João Magueijo from the Imperial College London and Niayesh Afshordi from the University of Waterloo in Canada first proposed the idea back in the 1990s. They now believe their theory can be tested using future observations of cosmic microwave background radiation, a map of the oldest light in the universe, according to their study published in the journalPhysical Review. My favorite quote: ""The alternative theory is inflation""https://t.co/nj2YDZNC97 The researchers believe that light travelled at an infinite speed following the big bang, before slowing down to what we define as lightspeed today (186,000mps/ 300,000kps). The variation is necessary to explain how the universe looks so uniform, which would have required light to reach every inch of the cosmos to even out its appearance. The new theory builds on the ‘Inflation’ theory, which suggested that the early universe was small before a sudden expansion. Magueijo and Afshordi believe the speed of light was much greater at first, before then dropping as the density of the universe changed. On this day in 1915, Einstein submitted his final paper on the general theory of relativity. Happy birthday, general relativity!#GR101pic.twitter.com/UXfPJVoaqe ""The theory, which we first proposed in the late-1990s, has now reached a maturity point – it has produced a testable prediction,""saidMagueijo.""If observations in the near future do find this number to be accurate, it could lead to a modification of Einstein's theory of gravity."" Their theory will be put to the test over the coming years as they examine cosmic microwave background radiation, with the leftover radiation from the big bang being measured as it changes. David Marsh from the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge University isn’t completely convinced by the new theory though. Marsh toldThe Guardian“The predictions of inflation developed by Stephen Hawking and others more than 30 years ago have been tested by cosmological observations and faced those tests remarkably well.” READ MORE: ‘New era of astronomy’: Gravitational waves detected for 2nd time, backing up theory of relativity RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

Before Ossiander and his team’s discovery scientists were only able to observe what happened after an electron leaves an atom, never the preceding event as it happened at an unmeasurable rate of time. “Using this information, we can measure the time it takes the electron to change its quantum state from the very constricted, bound state around the atom to the free state,”Ossiander said. Martin Schultze, also involved in the study, said the discovery gave an important insight into the quantum behavior of atoms and electrons, hopefully allowing for future understanding of phenomena including superconductivity and quantum computing.

"20 Sep, 2016 14:58",‘Quantum teleportation’ breakthrough by DARPA-funded physicists,"Two separate teams of scientists funded by the Pentagon’s research arm have revealed significant breakthroughs in the field of quantum teleportation which could have a major impact on cybersecurity and encryption. Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted from one place to another, and scientists have long sought to prove it is possible. Two separate DARPA-funded studies by physicists based inChinaandCalgary, Canada have now confirmed that not only is quantum teleportation a real phenomenon but they also demonstrated that it’s a workable technology that could one day help build an unhackable quantum communication systems to span great distances. 2 DARPA-funded teams have performed#quantum#teleportationover several kilometers of metropolitan fiber networks.https://t.co/Bdknpn0Ccv However, the breakthrough doesn’t mean that sci fi-style human teleportation is any closer as the photons aren’t actually disappearing from one place and appearing in another. Instead, it’s the information that’s being teleported through a phenomenon called ‘quantum entanglement’, which Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance”. According to the strange world of quantum mechanics some particles can be ‘entangled’ meaning that what happens to one particle will immediately affect the other, no matter how far apart they are. Using that property, quantum teleportation instantly transfers the state of one quantum particle to another without sending the particle itself - and without anything physical passing between them. The process is called ‘teleportation’ because the initial message is destroyed and only the information gets teleported from one place to another. The results of both the experiments were published in the scientific journalNature Photonicson Monday. The Canadian and Chinese teams used slightly different methods and generated different results, but they both successfully teleported information across existing optical fibre networks. This had never been done before outside of a lab and is seen as a huge breakthrough. One drawback in both of the experiments, however, was that they could send only a very limited amount of information. The Calgary experiment was the quicker, though less accurate, of the two and it managed to send just 17 photons a minute. via GIPHY Quantum teleportation has actually been achieved over greater distances in the past. In 2012 researchers from Austriaused lasersto teleport information a distance of 143km between two of the Canary Islands. However, that method isn't as reliable for practical networks as optical fibre because environmental conditions can disrupt the signal. The research was funded in part by DARPA'sQuinessandInformation in a Photonprograms. The Quiness program was set up to help prevent “adversaries” hacking Department of Defense information. DARPA say that ""photons are a valuable resource for many military applications ranging from communications systems to visible and infrared sensing platforms."" ""The broad availability of advanced communications technology possessed by adversaries makes it increasingly difficult to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of DoD information,"" thedefense researcherexplains. The biggest application of quantum teleportation is likely to be inencrypting information. As the two photons communicate with each other via quantum entanglement, it is much harder for an outsider to read the information. In order to decrypt a message, a hacker would need both the key - which is sent over the regular internet - and the entangled photons themselves.

"17 Aug, 2016 16:50",Artificial black hole ‘grown’ by Israeli physicist claims to prove Stephen Hawking’s key theory,"More than four decades after famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking concluded black holes aren’t entirely black, a scientist in Israel says he’s proven it. The theory goes that a certain amount of high-energy radiation escapes the gravitational pull of the light-sucking region of space-time. Jeff Steinhauer, a physicist at the Israel Institute of Technology, created what he calls an artificial black hole to test the theory of Hawking Radiation and has now announced the results. Up until 1974 when Hawking published his paper, physicists believed nothing could escape from a black hole, not even light. Hawking argued black holes do radiate certain particles which bring some of the hole’s energy with it as they escape. This explains why the ultimate“no go”areas grow smaller over time and eventually disappear. As technology is not yet capable of observing such small amounts of radiation, if it does in fact exist, scientists have been left to use black hole simulators to test the hypotheses, which is what Steinhauer used in his lab. Based on a proposal from 1981, the simulation known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is based on sound, not light, was built by Steinhauer in 2009. It consists of cooling rubidium atoms inside a tube to a temperature that is mere billionths of a degree above absolute zero, -273 Celsius. Supermassive black hole weighs in at 660mn times mass of Sunhttps://t.co/coL145v5odpic.twitter.com/0Cntsq6Q5C Steinhauer has spent seven years trying to perfect the conditions of a black hole’s perimeter, or event horizon, where such radiation would occur. Having this aspect of it pinned down, hisstudydetails how, after running his experiment 4,600 times, Steinhauer observed what Hawking had predicted decades ago. READ MORE: Rogue robots ‘could be hard to stop’ & 3 others things we learned from Stephen Hawking on Larry King As the experiments are based on lab-grown black holes, Hawking’s theory cannot be proven true in its application to a real black hole, at least until the Enterprise flies into one with shields on maximum to get some readings.

The vivid galaxy cluster Abell S1063, located some 4 billion light-years away, holds the key to this staggering phenomenon. Its immense mass causes a mesmerizing distortion of distance by the ‘bending’ of light. This gravitational lensing allows us to view galaxies well beyond the cluster, which would otherwise be impossible to see. Abell S1063 is home to...wait for it...100 million-million solar masses, including stars and nebulae and potentially more than 450 galaxies. If it all sounds a little Star Treky, that’s because it is. Katrina Jackson of NASA’s Goddard Flight Center credits the hit series with inspiring and encouraging many fans to explore space’s ‘final frontier’ in greater detail.

The international collaboration LIGO, with nearly 1,000 scientists working together, made the breakthrough announcement during a media conference taking place simultaneously in Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) and the San Diego Astronomy Association on Wednesday. “Detecting the gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes by LIGO’s detectors for the second time is highly important,” said MSU physics department professor Valery Mitrofanov, adding that this underpins gravitational wave astronomy. This time the movements of galactic fabric were picked up by LIGO’s twin detectors - one in Livingston, Louisiana, and another in Hanford, Washington – on December 26, 2015. ""It is important that the second signal was generated by the black holes with relatively small mass and it better corresponds to predictions made by astrophysicists. Now we can be more confident that the first event was not a rare exception,” said MSU physics department professor Farid Khalili.

"10 Jun, 2016 18:40",Through the wormhole: Spacecraft could survive black hole shortcut across the universe – study,"A spacecraft could survive a journey through a wormhole in the center of a black hole and pass into another universe despite its strong tidal forces, according to theoretical physicists. A new study conducted by Diego Rubiera-Garcia, of Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IA) in Portugal, and his team, published in the journalClassical and Quantum Gravityreconsiders Einstein’s theory that black holes destroy everything within their reach. via GIPHY A wormhole is a theoretical passage through space-time that could create‘shortcuts’, facilitating journeys across the universe. It was proposed by Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen with the aid of the theory of general relativity in 1935. The hypothetical structure was considered unstable, however, and at risk of collapsing on any particle passing through it at the point of‘singularity’– where the forces of gravity are at their most intense, and where time and space effectively end. via GIPHY However, following their analysis of what causes the destruction, Rubiera-Garcia and his team say the problem is much“subtler”. “In practical terms, we dropped one assumption that holds in general relativity, but there is no a priori reason for it to hold in extensions of this theory,""Rubiera-Garcia toldPhys.org. They examined various objects as an aggregation of points interconnected by physical or chemical interactions holding them together. ""Each particle of the observer follows a geodesic line determined by the gravitational field. Each geodesic feels a slightly different gravitational force, but the interactions among the constituents of the body could nonetheless sustain the body,""Rubiera-Garcia said. The studyfoundthat the time a light ray takes in making a round trip between any two nearby geodesics is always finite and causal despite the infinite (spatial) stretching caused by the unbounded tidal force. This suggests that curvature divergences may not be as extreme as traditionally thought, the study states. “Our observer could get swallowed into the black hole, cross the wormhole throat, exit through the other side, and live to tell it regardless of the existence of infinite tidal forces,”Rubiera-Garcia explained. via GIPHY “The emergence of wormholes and new physics beyond Einstein’s gravity may help solve longstanding puzzles and bring a happy ending to an otherwise horror story,”he concluded. At the end of last year,NASAannounced plans for further wormhole research with the view to carrying out robotic interstellar missions in the future. One such mission has been realized on the big screen in the blockbuster Interstellar where astronauts search for a new planet by traveling through a wormhole. via GIPHY  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"17 May, 2016 22:57",‘Trapping atoms between laser beams’: AI research tool runs Nobel Prize physics experiment,"A team of Australian physicists have created a new research assistant to run experiments in quantum mechanics in the form of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, which promptly took control of the experiment, learned on the job, and even innovated. “I didn’t expect the machine could learn to do the experiment itself, from scratch, in under an hour,”said co-lead researcher Paul Wigley from the Australian National University (ANU) Research School of Physics and Engineering in a statement. “A simple computer program would have taken longer than the age of the universe to run through all the combinations and work this out,”he added. AI learns and recreates Nobel-winning physics experimenthttps://t.co/QC6agxNVZHpic.twitter.com/AehgnpNvUf Scientists wanted to recreate an experiment that won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics, which involved extremely cold gas trapped in a laser beam known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. The condensates“are some of the coldest places in the Universe, far colder than outer space, typically less than a billionth of a degree above absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius, or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit),”according toANU. Parse this: Google releases free AI software that can understand Englishhttps://t.co/ZyhTNMPIlUpic.twitter.com/WzAhuJqhTA The experiment involved trapping 40 million atoms at the intersection between two laser beams. The team used magnetic fields to cool the atoms down to about five millionths of a degree above absolute zero. Scientists then used the AI algorithm to control the lasers during cooling, carefully tuning the power of the two lasers to allow the most energetic atoms to escape without losing hold of the coldest ones. The AI algorithm was able to do this ten times faster than a regular non-AI program. “It is cheaper than taking a physicist everywhere with you. This is the first application of AI like this, where it’s controlling an experiment and optimizing it on its own,”said Michael Hush, a physicist at the University of New South Wales who co-led the work,according toCosmos. Parse this: Google releases free AI software that can understand Englishhttps://t.co/ZyhTNMPIlUpic.twitter.com/WzAhuJqhTA Scientists also noticed that the AI algorithm set itself up quickly every morning and compensated for any overnight fluctuations before coming up with a solution to tamp down the power of the lasers. “It may be able to come up with complicated ways humans haven’t thought of to get experiments colder and make measurements more precise,”said Wigley.

"7 May, 2016 04:01",Biochemists watch gene expression in real time - study,"The fundamental rule of molecular biology is “DNA makes RNA makes protein,” but up until now biochemists haven’t “seen” it in action, as Albert Einstein College scientists did by adding codes of fluorescent proteins into live cells and neurons. Albert Einstein College scientists were trying to overcome two challenges – finding a way to visualize single molecules of messenger RNA, or mRNA, as well as single molecules of protein translated from mRNA. Proteins perform most cellular functions and are the reason we are all alive. “Translation is the fundamental biological process for converting mRNA’s information into proteins,”saidthe paper’s co-author, Dr. Robert Singer, who is co-chair of anatomy and structural biology and co-director of the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center at Einstein. In scientific first, researchers visualize proteins being bornhttps://t.co/j56B3lMkIH@EinsteinMed For the first challenge, Dr. Bin Wu, the lead author of the study, adapted a technique from an earlier paper published in 1998 that visualized single molecules of mRNA in living cells. By adding“mRNA that codes for red fluorescent protein”to a retrovirus and inserting it into cells, the translation could be seen. For the second challenge, Dr. Wu used a recently published technique to encode single-chain antibodies fused to green fluorescent protein to bind to a newly formed protein,“making the protein visible.” Visualizing the birth of proteins 🔬https://t.co/WsXx5zKTlf Dr. Singer explained,“We know from genome-wide studies that translation controls protein abundance in cells – crucially important to every single function that cells carry out. Using this technology, we can finally learn how translation is regulated and gain major insights into diseases that occur when translation is faulty.” 'Compact & durable’: Scientists encode, retrieve 10,000 gigabytes stored on DNA moleculeshttps://t.co/SDOUu4pux0pic.twitter.com/GdfskSipLh The scientists observed the translation of single messenger RNA molecules in two types of cells: human cancer cells and mouse neurons. Then they made a surprising discovery. When they looked at the translation in mouse neurons, they noticed“mRNA translation into protein was found to occur in ‘bursts’ – a phenomenon never before possible to observe,”according to the Einstein statement. “Bursts of translation activity may be the best way for neurons to control the amount and location of protein production – and neurological disease may result from neurons’ inability to control that bursting,”saidDr. Singer.“So our findings may have implications for intellectual disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome, which seem to involve too much protein production, and possibly for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s in which clumps of beta-amyloid protein may block neuron-to-neuron signaling at synapses.” 1000+ yr shelf life: Microsoft buys into synthetic DNA for data storagehttps://t.co/xFzWUzSRWkpic.twitter.com/TM1QDB2E7d When researchers looked at mRNA translation in cancer cells, they noticed that they“displayed a striking inability to regulate the translation of mRNA… instead it was [a] continuous process in these cells.” “Since proteins play crucial roles in controlling division, the uncontrolled translation of certain proteins may lead to certain types of cancer,”stated Einstein College. “With our technology, researchers can now study disease-causing protein aberrations at a very basic level that was never possible before,”said Dr. Singer.

The lack of prominent US individuals among the 11 million released documents has also raised a few eyebrows. suspicions understandable when no US officials & corporate media gatekeeping the leakshttps://t.co/pyNLoUyOyR But if we are indeed talking about a US/ Sorosian conspiracy to foment trouble in Russia in a parliamentary election year, then it’s a plan which seems to owe more to Baldrick than Albert Einstein. While ‘official enemies’ Putin and Assad duly made the headlines on day one of the news leak, the story has now moved on and threatens to jeopardize the careers of individuals Washington surely wouldn’t want to see affected. Furthermore, the leaks also put into the spotlight the turbo-globalist, elite-friendly economic system designed not in Russia, but by self-styled ‘free marketers’ in the US and Britain in the 1970s. A Pandora’s Box has been opened by the Panama leaks and - ironically given the ICIJ and the OCCRP’s funding – it’s billionaire global capitalists like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash. Here’s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we’ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super-rich as elite-friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II. In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005. Last October, Oxfamrevealedthat half the world’s wealth was in the hands of just one percent of the population. The Panama leaks, described by whistleblower Edward Snowden as“the biggest leak in the history of data journalism,”show us how the global super-rich exploit the current system still further to keep their wealth away from the taxman - and get even richer at our expense. And what the revelations make clear is that the super-rich wouldn’t be able to do this without the help of banks, lawyers, accountants and other intermediaries who most clearly do not act in the public interest. British neocons and Sorosian ‘liberals’ who no doubt gloated over Monday’s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don’t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes out smelling of roses, it’s Washington’s most obedient ally- Britain - and its political and financial elites that arguably comes out of this scandal worst of all.

The role of British banks, such as HSBC, Rothschild and Coutts in helping the rich stash their gains away intax-havenshas also been highlighted. Roll call of top Tory tycoons exposed in#PanamaLeakshttps://t.co/uEZJvpSocEpic.twitter.com/RgV1oJejOR Indeed, the Panama scandal goes right to the heart of the British establishment as top Tory donors have been named in the leaked Papers. But it’s therevelationsabout the late father of the current Prime Minister which could do most damage to Cameron and his government. Ian Cameron, a multi-millionaire stockbroker, was the director of an investment fund called Blairmore, which was incorporated in Panama and run from The Bahamas. The fund, which helped the super-rich shield investments from UK tax, has never paid a penny of tax in over thirty years. Cameron has been accused of failing to give a ‘clear and full account’ about his links to the fund set up by his father. At first Number 10 said that Cameron’s tax affairs were a“private matter”. Then on Tuesday a new statement""To be clear, the prime minister, his wife and their children do not benefit from any offshore funds. The prime minister owns no shares.” On Wednesday though- a slightly different story emerged. We weretoldthat there were“no offshore trusts or funds”that Cameron or his near family would benefit from“in future”’. What makes all this harder to take are the policies of austerity pushed on the British people by Cameron and his party. The lives ruined by Cameron's govt demands justice re the crooked money used to give him the life of privilege he's enjoyed.#panamapapers Only a week or so ago, it was revealed that over 300 public libraries had been forced to close in England and Wales since 2010 because of spending cuts. These cuts- we‘re told- are made to help reduce the government deficit, but imagine how healthy the public finances would be if instead of tax-dodging and helping others to tax-dodge, multi-millionaires like the Prime Minister’s father had paid their proper contribution? As opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn correctly stated:“This is money that’s taken from our health service, our local services.” At a time of plenty, tax-dodging by the super-rich might lead to a shrug of the shoulders, but at a time of cuts which are havingdisastrous consequenceson individuals and communities,it’s enough to turn the mildest, most politically moderate person into a pitchfork-carrying revolutionary. One name you know you'll never find in the#PanamaPapers: Jeremy Bernard Corbyn#OurCorbynpic.twitter.com/VLlxuK4pui In Britain the #PanamaPapers revelations are likely to provide a boost for Jeremy Corbyn ahead of important local elections next month. And in America, Bernie Sanders could be the beneficiary. An article in Wednesday’s Independent newspaper in Britainarguesthat “The Panama Papers could hand Bernie Sanders the White House.” “Nobody is going to be under more pressure than Hillary Clinton,”argues Matthew Turner.“For some Americans, she is the embodiment of a 'global elite;' while Bernie Sanders is its antithesis… The huge leak exposes governments across the globe willfully ignoring tax avoidance by the rich. Although Clinton has not been linked to any malfeasance in the leak, there is a sense that she is among the elite rich, some of whose members have benefited from such schemes.” Well, if the #PanamaPapers do help Bernie to the White House - and indeed Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 in Britain - we can only imagine what George Soros’s reaction would be. After all this is a man who hasdonated$7m to a Hillary Clinton super PAC. For all his progressive talk, the very last thing the ‘liberal’ George Soros would like to see is a return of socialistic economies in the West and across the world. He has after all spent decades helping to topple and destabilize governments which put their people before the interests of predatory global capitalists and hedge funders like himself. Is his anti-Putin obsession so great he’d risk bringing the whole system down with him? The Panama Leaks may or may not have been part of a conspiracy against Russia (and its worth pointing out that the ICIJ head Gerard Ryle hasdeniedthis is the case, but one thing is for sure: their consequences are going to be felt across the world and not just in Iceland, where public protests have already led to thestepping asideof Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsonn- after his links to an offshore company were revealed. Icelandic PM quits. British PM?#PanamaLeakspic.twitter.com/plTheTe7Um Let’s return to Pandora. After she had closed her box, one thing was left: Hope- and that's what we've got going for us today. Hope that we can change a system which benefits the global super-rich at the expense of everyone else. If the #PanamaPapers do in time lead to a much fairer and more transparent global economic system, in which tax havens are closed and the 1 percent’s wealth is used to benefit the Common Weal, then it really will be three cheers for those who are releasing the documents - whoever it is who funds them and whatever agenda they might have had at the start.

"4 Apr, 2016 21:13","NASA ‘inadequate,’ Turkish technology ‘better’ – Turkish minister","Surprisingly, NASA’s technology has recently come under fire from… Turkey’s Forestry and Waterworks Minister Veysel Eroglu, who called it “inadequate,” asserting that Turkish science is “better.” “Who does NASA think it is? We are better than them,” Eroglu said during a discussion in Turkey’s parliament, as cited by Hurryiet Daily News. “They might have satellites but we have our Göktürk,” he said, referring to Turkey’s civil and military observation satellite. The minister also argued that Turkish technology is ahead of NASA’s, stressing that the weather forecasts of the US agency, which is in charge of aeronautics and aerospace research, had not been accurate over the past year. Eroglu further elaborated, explaining that the scope of NASA’s weather studies are too broad, while 1,450+ of Turkey’s observation systems focus on specific regions. Eroglu’s rant comes just over a month after NASA, whose most recent achievement was discovering the gravitational waves predicted by Einstein a century ago, released a statement saying that the Levant region (which includes Turkey) experienced the worst drought in 900 years from 1998 to 2012. “If we look at recent events and we start to see anomalies that are outside this range of natural variability, then we can say with some confidence that it looks like this particular event or this series of events had some kind of human-caused climate change contribution,” Ben Cook, lead author and climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said last month. In their study, NASA scientists reconstructed the Mediterranean’s drought history by studying tree rings – a record dubbed the 'Old World Drought Atlas.'The team discovered patterns in the geographic distribution of droughts, allowing them to identify their causes.  Theresearchwas part of NASA’s current project to improve computer models that simulate climate. via GIPHY One of the conclusions of the research was that the entire Mediterranean region might dry out due to human-induced global warming in years to come. “The Mediterranean is one of the areas that is unanimously projected [in climate models] as going to dry in the future [due to man-made climate change],” Yochanan Kushnir, a climate scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, explained, adding that the Levant’s recent dry years are a sign that the region may already be suffering from human-induced warming of the planet.

"1 Apr, 2016 13:23",The Libyan front: How terror could soon metastasize in Africa,"The forgotten child of Western interventionism, Libya continues to battle its demons: terror, instability, mass migration, which NATO ever-so willingly unleashed onto the war-torn nation under the convenient label of “humanitarian interventionism.” If Libya stands today free of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, and the violent nepotism his rule asserted as the predominant socio-political matrix, the North African nation is not exactly home free either. And while there is no denying that Gaddafi had to go … if anything, because his people wished it so, Western interventionism literally exploded Libya’s chance at a unified transition of power. Should Libya been allowed to handle its own affairs, should Libyans been allowed to practice their free political will, it is likely the country would not have fallen prey to terror – it is likely war would not have broken out between tribal factions, and it is likely radical militants would never have had the opportunity to open a new front of terror in Africa – right at Europe’s doorstep. In true neocon fashion, NATO preferred to destroy first, bomb now, and then blame someone else later…in most cases - Russia. Funny though how strikingly different Western interventionism has been from Russia’s careful, and lawful collaboration with its foreign partners: i.e. Syria. Wherever Western powers have dropped bombs, chaos, death and more radicalism have ensued – whenever Russia has stepped in however radicals have retreated, andIDPs returned home. Are you still under the impression that Western capitals know best? Clearly they don’t. Clearly their agenda lies not in the promotion of stability, but rather absolute chaos. Because it would be foolish to think that their actions are only the products of stupid politicking. Let us remember that chaos has beengood for business. Chaos has allowed Western governments to cultivate a new form of neo-colonial co-dependence, where the master needs his subject, just as much as the subject needs his master to survive. While most industries in the Western hemisphere have suffered from the effects of global recession, there is one sector which has thrived above all: the defense industry. Now tell me that from a purely capitalistic standpoint wars are not needed. Libya, like so many other countries in the Greater Middle East - Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen - has been framed within a narrative of righteous interventionism. Back in 2011, the UN Security Council legitimized NATO’s calls for military action with aresolutionwhich argued that in view of Gaddafi’s “crimes against humanity” the world had a responsibility of care. It is such a stance which eventually permitted NATO to unleash its military forces against the Gaddafi regime. If NATO’s Libyan campaign was then hailed a success, since it allowed for Gaddafi’s demise, it also opened up Libya to the likes of al-Qaeda, and ISIS - de facto fracturing an otherwise relatively united nation. Since its liberation, Libya has reverted to its pre-colonial set up – back when tribes were still looking to assert their competing authorities over one another, thus making territorial unity but a mirage in the distance. Abdelkader Abderrahmane, an independent geopolitical researcher and analyst on African security recently noted in an interview:“Gaddafi is gone, as are the foreign fighter planes, but Libya is far from stable. There are two rival governments – one in Tobruk and one in Tripoli – and the so-called Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) has been making major gains in the embattled and now chaotic country. Foreign powers have been expressing concern about the group’s expansion in the oil-rich state, and although US Secretary of State John Kerry has ruled out another military intervention, there are signs that such action may be on the cards. Some Libyans, forced to flee ISIL or live under its rule, are themselves beginning to discuss intervention as the only way forward.” Although NATO has long argued that if not for its intervention Libya would have suffered many great crimes, somewhat trying to rationalize a second coming of sort, logic would caution against it. It was Albert Einstein I believe who defined insanity as doing the same actions again, and again while expecting a different result. I think we already establish how the militarization of the Greater Middle East has only EVER resulted in the rise of more instability, and more radicalism - playing directly into the hands of terror’s masterminds, especially since Western powers have gone about it with no real vision. You can’t pulverize a country into stability. As pointed out by Abderrahmane:“A new intervention would have dramatic consequences for Africa, already suffering under the weight of Islamist radicalization.” The spread of terror to Africa is only half the problem. With war and the inevitable bombing campaigns the West is so fond of more people will attempt to resettle elsewhere. And since there are only so many ways they can actually go, Europe will most likely be the destination of choice. And then what? The fear today is that ISIS could metastasize across Africa, now that it has gained a foothold into Libya According to the Shafaqna Institute for Middle Eastern Studies, an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 foreign fighters could have already swollen ISIS ranks, with about 7,000 fighters in Libya itself - a number which could very well double, should NATO return to the offensive, playing into the group’s argument that Western powers seek to colonize the African continent once more. With access tobillions of dollarsthrough the black terror trade, ISIS has the finances and the manpower to take a firm hold in Africa. Rather than help solve Libya’s instability conundrum, a second military intervention is likely to send ISIS into a dangerous flight that will resonate in the rest of the continent, as radicals will go underground, breaking themselves up into sleeper cells across the Sahel and further south. If ISIS has relied on its foreign fighters to expand its reach, the group’s ability to recruit locals should not be underestimated. In January, Algeria arrested some 300 Moroccans attempting to cross into Libya. How many times will we have to repeat the same mistakes before we realize that brutal force is not a solution in itself, and that wars are not conduits for democracy building? One would think that Syria would have taught Western governments a thing or two … especially in the light of Russia’s victory against terror. THAT no one wants to talk about of course.

The doctor has been performing his“controversial”anal massage treatments in Sweden, Norway and Denmark over the past two decades.

The doctor said he had done up to 1,000 similar treatments with good results. He was allowed to continue to practice medicine after appealing to the courts in 2008. He lost his license in Denmark last July after he pierced a patient’s lung after trying to inject his/her chest with anesthetic. This prompted the Swedish HSAN to revoke his license on Thursday. In Norway, he was dismissed in 2006 after it was discovered he had been fired from another area the year before. The doctor described it as a witch hunt.

"12 Feb, 2016 06:29",Russian scientists tell RT how they enabled discovery of cosmic gravitational waves (EXCLUSIVE),"The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves came as a result of a decades-long international effort. Thanks to the work of Russian scientists, the minuscule waves could finally be separated from other noises. RT spoke to the researchers involved. The“very weak spacetime wiggles”that travel through the universe at the speed of light have been detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in the US. The system includes two identical detectors designed to spot tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves. A team of around a thousand scientists from around the globe work for the observatories, described as “the most precise measuring device ever built,” and it is the Russian researchers who contributed to the system’s precision mechanism. ‘We proved Einstein right!’ 100 years on, gravitational waves confirmedhttps://t.co/lrxMia3XPdpic.twitter.com/j4byXV8l02 The Russian team, headed by scientist Vladimir Braginsky, started working on the very complicated engineering structure that later became known as LIGO in 1992, the media was told at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, which was held simultaneously with Washington's announcement from the National Science Foundation that funds LIGO.“We’ve been working since 1992, and eventually the universe has given us such a present,”the group of elated scientists said. The gravitational waves signal recorded on September 14, 2015, had been produced by two colliding black holes, each about 30 times the mass of the Sun, which came together and merged. It's the first time the collision of black holes has not been proven only theoretically, but""experimentally witnessed on Earth,""Russian researchers said, adding that such observations can be registered on our planet, millions of light years away from the collision, only if a""cosmological catastrophe with a huge energy outbreak""occurs.But even then, gravitational waves are minuscule, causing the distance of 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) between the detectors to change by ten to the power of minus 19 of a meter – and""that's the main problem,""scientists said. Ways to measure such slight changes in distances were proposed by Russian researchers in the 1990s.Having managed to register the waves that could potentially be gravitational, scientists were then faced with a new challenge: to reduce the sources of noises in the detectors to help single out gravitational waves.""Everything causes noise: a car passing by, a plane in the sky, or even tiny movements of the Earth's crust. Detecting a signal amid all this noise is extremely difficult, although of course there are methods, both mathematical and technological – and it costs a lot of money,""Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Pavel Ivanov told RT. Vladimir Braginsky, one of the pioneers of the gravitational waves research, and his team of young and enthusiastic physicists from Moscow State University worked on parts of LIGO, and particularly its sensor elements. Braginsky himself tried to build detectors to spot gravitational waves back in the 1970s. ""In the early 1990s we started working on a quartz pendulum, aiming to reduce the time of its amplitude losses to minimize thermal noises,""said Russian Academy of Sciences member Valery Mitrofanov, who heads the Moscow group of scientists collaborating with LIGO. Physicists from Moscow State University also proved that it is molten quartz rather than sapphire that reduces noises better, and thus have discovered the new class of materials for the detectors, Mitrofanov added. Now Russian researchers work with LIGO detectors in the US and explore all kinds of noises to single out the ones coming from far away cosmic objects. A couple of years ago, LIGO registered a signal that all scientists involved were pretty much sure was gravitational waves, Mitrofanov said. But when everything was checked and double checked, it turned out the discovered waves were artificially initiated by an anonymous small group of researchers, to test the work of the detectors. Russian scientists contributed not only to practical advances to catch traveling gravity, but also made some breakthrough theoretical suggestions. The idea to look for the waves was put forward and published in science magazines by Soviet physicists Mikhail Gertsenshtein and Vladislav Pustovoit in 1962, and then developed further by academic Yakov Zeldovich and his followers. It was Zeldovich who told American astrophysicist Kip Thorne – the scientist at the forefront of LIGO’s work – that it must be black holes that produce the gravitational waves strong enough to be detected. Decades later, the official announcement of the final discovery of the waves paved the way for a new era in astronomy, researchers said at the Moscow briefing.""A new channel for receiving information about the universe from space is now open,""Mitrofanov said, adding that after the breakthrough detection in September more gravitational waves – but less intense – have already been observed. Scientists now hope that they might register the waves once a month.

"12 Feb, 2016 02:15",Zika virus linked to miscarriages in two US women – CDC,"Two American women who contracted the Zika virus while traveling abroad miscarried after returning home, the Centers for Disease Control said on Thursday. The Washington Postreports that “It’s absolutely possible for an infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, to result in a miscarriage,” according to Zev Williams, an OB-GYN at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. While miscarriages have previously been reported abroad, these are the first linked to Zika that have been reported in the United States. “We are quite literally learning more about Zika every single day,” Frieden told the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health & International Organizations. Meanwhile, researchers in Salvador, Brazil are checking miscarriages and still births at three maternity hospitals for links to Zika. In addition, researchers from Slovenia discovered traces of Zika in a fetus whose mother was infected with the virus,Gizmodoreports. The 25-year-old woman in that case had been a volunteer in Brazil and contracted the virus when she was 13 weeks pregnant. Later in her pregnancy, she received ultrasounds that revealed a small fetal head and other abnormalities seen in Zika cases. After consulting with national and hospital ethics boards, the Slovenian woman chose to abort the fetus. An autopsy revealed that particles of the Zika virus and a significant amount of viral genomic RNA were present in the brain, but not other organs. “The findings of this case report do not provide absolute proof that Zika virus causes microcephaly,” Eric J. Rubin, associate editor of the New England Journal of Medicine said, but added that it “makes the link stronger.” While the US desperately works to learn more about Zika, women in countries affected by the outbreak are struggling to find support.Refinery 29reports that governments in Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador, and Ecuador are advising women to avoid getting pregnant for the next two years. However, roughly 97 percent of women of childbearing age face “highly restrictive” abortion laws in those Latin American and Caribbean nations, according to theGuttmacher Institute, a non-profit organization that promotes reproductive health through birth control. In fact, El Salvador is one of seven nations in the world that have completely banned abortion. Despite the restrictions, some 4.4 million abortions were performed in Latin America in 2008, according to Guttmacher. Some reproductive-rights advocates are concerned that the Zika outbreak may prompt an increase in abortions, particularly unsafe ones. Sara García, an advocate for women’s reproductive rights in El Salvador, told Refinery 29 that, “Women in the region are having abortions; they’re just having them in an unsafe and clandestine manner.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

It all depends on your imagination. However, scientists go by the hard data. Two black holes, each about 30 times the mass of the sun, collided in September of 2015, leaving behind a gravitational wave that rippled throughout the universe. Scientists converted the waves they caught into sound waves that can now be heard in the video. READ MORE: RT talks to LIGO physicist Kip Thorne on detecting gravitational waves (EXCLUSIVE) In the“language”of gravitational waves, the bird-like chirp we hear can mean anything from spinning to collision, but the closer the black holes get to each other, the higher the frequency of sound waves. That is why the collision itself sounds louder – more like a record-scratch. In other words, more active black holes are, the louder the sound would be.

"11 Feb, 2016 19:34",RT talks to LIGO physicist Kip Thorne on detecting gravitational waves (EXCLUSIVE),"First predicted a century ago by Albert Einstein, the ground-breaking detection of gravitational waves could completely revolutionize our understanding of the universe and pave the way to missions to black holes. RT talks to Kip Thorne, the LIGO physicist behind the research. READ MORE: Wave reviews: Proof of gravity’s vibrations leaves internet floating on air RT:People here in Russia are particularly excited, because of this link that the hunt for gravitational waves was actually traced all the way back to Soviet scientists. How important was their contribution? Kip Thorne:Their contribution was very important as the initial outline of the idea of this method. But a much larger contribution to our effort has come from the research group of Vladimir Braginsky at Moscow State University. I have personally had a close collaboration with Braginsky and his team. A sense going all the way going back to the early 1970s. And his team contributed the key idea of how to suspend the mirrors that we have. We have giant mirrors, they weigh 40 kilograms, they move back and forth by tiny amounts in response to gravitational waves and you have to suspend them in a way that produces no noise, it doesn’t jerk the mirrors at all. The suspensions were the result of research at Moscow State University by Braginsky’s group. An understanding of sudden jerking of the suspensions and of other mechanical pieces in this instrument, so-called excess noise or creep, that also comes from the Moscow State University group. That has been absolutely crucial to the success that we have announced here today. RT:Was this truly a team effort?KT:This was truly a team effort. Professor Braginsky had built a different type of detector, the type that was pioneered by Joseph Weber in the United States. When the technique that we were using in our prototype detectors became good enough and it was clear that this would be the method that would succeed, Braginsky shut down his old effort and he joined together with LIGO. And his team at Moscow State University has been a participant in our research going way back to the 1980s before almost any other team elsewhere in the world was participating. We now have sixteen nations involved in this, but the Russian contribution goes back almost to the beginning and has been truly crucial. RT:Your expertise has been used in Hollywood. You were a scientific advisor to the movie Interstellar, the film where the hero enters a black hole. That’s fiction, but how close is it to becoming a fact. Is such a mission ever going to be possible, do you think?KT:I believe that humans will ultimately do missions to black holes, but the nearest black hole is much farther away than the nearest other star besides the Sun. We don’t have the technology to go there now, we won’t have the technology to go there for several centuries, but I do believe we will get there and we will do explorations in the vicinities of the black holes. Very, very unlikely that anyone will ever go inside a black hole and survive. We’re not 100 percent sure, and in the movie Interstellar it does happen and I explain it in the book I wrote called The Physics of Interstellar. I explain how it happens, but that’s speculative. We don’t understand the interiors of black holes well enough to know whether that could really happen – and it probably can’t. LISTEN MORE: But what we have seen today in some ways is more fantastic. It’s not just a black hole there that you’re studying. It’s two black holes that go around each other, spiral together, and collide. And in that collision, they create something that we have never ever seen before as humans, as scientists, as astronomers. They create a storm in the fabric of space and time. It’s as though we had only seen the ocean surface on a calm day, but we had never seen it in a storm with crashing ocean waves. Similarly we have never seen space time with wildly oscillating rate of flow of time, wildly oscillating shape of space. We have never seen that before. Now we have seen it both in computer simulations and in observations with this gravitational wave detection. It’s a whole new way to study the universe. A whole new way to probe aspects of black holes that we didn’t understand until now. RT:Clearly, a lot of scientist are extremely excited about this. Why though in particularly. What opportunities do you foresee opening up now because of this?KT:This is just the very beginning. We’ve seen our first gravitational wave. We’ve seen for the first time two black holes colliding to form a new black hole. We’ve seen for the first time how space time behaves in a storm. But it’s just the beginning. We will be observing and studying other options. We will see neutron stars made of pure nuclear matter, but the size of a very small town, spinning around and around with little mountains on their surface creating gravitational waves which enable us to explore the physics of nuclear matter. We will see black holes tear neutron stars apart. We’ll see neutron stars collide. We expect to see the central engines of supernova explosions. We even hope to see gravitational waves from cosmic strings. Strings that stretch across the universe, that are thought to have been created in the birth of the universe by the expansion to cosmic scale of the fundamental strings that are building blocks of all matter. We will be exploring these kind of phenomena. We’ve only looked at gravitational waves with one wave length with periods of oscillation of milliseconds. There will be new gravitational wave windows opened onto the universe with other kinds of detectors that will see completely different things. Detectors that will be flown in space and we’ll see gravitational waves with periods of oscillation of minutes to hours. Detectors that will see periods of oscillation of months to years and even decades. And gravitational waves that have periods of oscillation nearly as long as the age of the universe. We will see all of these and learn completely different aspects of the universe with them. Each of these gravitational wave windows is sort of like going from optical to X-rays to radio waves where we different aspects of the universe with each of those tools. Each of the news gravitational wave windows will teach us different things. It’s a beginning of a whole new way to explore the universe. A way that will be a big part of 21 century astronomy and cosmology. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"11 Feb, 2016 19:06",Wave reviews: Proof of gravity’s vibrations leaves internet floating on air,"A century after physicist Albert Einstein first mooted the idea of gravitational waves, US scientists have confirmed their existence. Einstein proposed in 1916, through hisTheory of General Relativity, that what we know as ‘gravitational pull’ is created by the distortion in space-time by mass or energy. Before today’sannouncement, physical proof of the vibrations had been sought for decades by scientists who harbored hope of tracing waves which originated in the Big Bang - the creation of the universe. LISTEN: This is the sound of two black holes collidinghttps://t.co/lrxMialyGL#LIGO#gravitywaveshttps://t.co/tIaLL16Ggu TheLIGO Scientific Collaborationhad been leading the research, operating detectors - known as interferometers - in the United States. The detectors work by splitting a laser beam between two perpendicular corridors 4km in length, bouncing them off mirrors at each end. Without the presence of a gravitational wave, the beams should return to their source at exactly the same time. But the presence of gravity waves would influence the beams differently: with stretching or squeezing of space-time from a gravity wave, the distance to the mirror is longer in one corridor and shorter in the other, meaning the light will not be in sync.  The groundbreaking discovery was actually recorded on the September 14 last year. .@LIGOscientists at#Caltechviewing get a well-deserved round of applause#gravitationalwaves#einsteinwasrightpic.twitter.com/Vv6IsrroSV Now with the waves detected from two black holes colliding, a new dawn in science can begin.

"11 Feb, 2016 15:36","‘We proved Einstein right!’ 100 years on, gravitational waves confirmed in breakthrough research","Scientists at Washington’s National Science Foundation and Moscow State University have confirmed the discovery of Albert Einstein’s gravitational waves. The breakthrough, possibly the biggest in physics in a century, could be the key to new understanding of the universe. Recent rumors of the success in detecting gravitational waves, or as some scientists put it ""very weak spacetime wiggles which propagate at the speed of light"" were officially confirmed Thursday. ""Ladies and gentelman, we have detected gravitational waves"" dice David Reitze, director del@LIGO.pic.twitter.com/WmczsUFP5W ""Ladies and gentlemen! We have detected gravitational waves, we did it!,"" LIGO laboratory executive director David Reitze announced in Washington. ""These gravitational waves were produced by two colliding black holes, [that] came together, merged and formed a single black hole about 1.3 billion years ago,"" Reitze said. These ripples in the fabric of spacetime are one of the most important variables in Einstein's theory of relativity and it took astronomers decades to detect them, although they were pretty sure that gravitational waves existed. LIVE: Total power output in#GravitationalWaveswas 50 times greater than all stars in the universe combinedhttps://t.co/oN9x0uQTcN#LIGO The discovery has been made with the use of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) - a system of two detectors constructed to spot tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves. Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIGO's identical detectors are located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. The observatories, which are ""the most precise measuring device ever built,"" recorded a signal on September 14, 2015, ""nearly simultaneously,"" and the signal ""had a very specific characteristic,"" the laboratories' director said. ""As time went forward, the frequency went up,"" he explained, adding that it took scientists months of careful checking and analysis to confirm that what had been discovered was exactly gravitational waves. Each of the two black holes before merging had about 30 times the mass of the Sun, were 150 kilometers (93 miles) in diameter and accelerated to about half the speed of light. The detected collision also proved that the merging of binary black holes does exist in the universe. ""Let's say this: The first discovery of gravitational waves is a Nobel Prize-winning venture,"" said physicist Bruce Allen of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany. But the prize will be most possibly given not to theorists, but those who are behind the mechanism that confirmed the existence of the waves, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Pavel Ivanov told RT. Russian scientists have massively contributed to both of the advances, Ivanov explained, mentioning Soviet scientist Yakov Zeldovich and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Braginsky, who has been closely working with Kip Thorne, the American astrophysicist at the forefront of the discovery. The idea to look for the waves was suggested and published in science magazines by Soviet physicists Mikhail Gertsenshtein and Vladislav Pustovoit in 1962, and then developed further by academic Zeldovich and his followers, who explored the theory of gravitational waves. Braginsky and his teams have been working on developing detectors for LIGO. According to Einstein's theory, published in 1916, the universe is made up of a ""fabric of spacetime"": massive accelerating objects in the universe are believed to bend this fabric, causing ripples known as gravitational waves. The colliding of two black holes or merging of two pulsars are among the presumable causes of such waves' formation. ""The theory describes geometry of space and time. When gravitational wave propagates, it changes [this] geometry,"" Ivanov told RT, adding that ""in general relativity and all modern studies of gravity the gravitational field is considered as something that is similar to the electromagnetic field."" ""The discovery of gravitational waves could open a new window in our universe, because before we studied it only using electromagnetic [knowledge], and now we can do it in almost all wave bands, from radio waves to gamma rays,"" Ivanov said. The ability to analyze the information carried on gravitational waves could potentially provide more insight into the Big Bang and other violent events in the history of the Universe, and help to explore if other universes exist, what is inside Black Holes and even potentially pave the way for time travel. LIVE: Russian scientists discuss#gravitationalwavesearchhttps://t.co/YhXaWM4RpVpic.twitter.com/RewCvtSdbf Although Einstein predicted that gravity travels in waves a century ago, detecting gravitational waves was not an easy task due to the fact that their effect is miniscule and easily confused with random noise. ""Everything causes noise: a car passing by, a plane in the sky, or even tiny movements of the Earth's crust. Detecting a signal amid all this noise is extremely difficult, although of course there are methods, both mathematical and technological - and it costs a lot of money,"" Ivanov told RT. The discovery might lead to creation of new chapter in physics – quantum gravity, scientists believe. It will bring together the knowledge in Einstein's theory and wave mechanics.

Don’t be embarrassed if it all leaves you confused and you just can’t share their excitement. Here's your guide to gravitational waves, short and simple as ABC. So here's what happened: researchers at Montana State University have anupdatefrom the LIGO observatory on their progress in detecting gravitational waves. It is one of the biggest mysteries of the past 100 years that we inherited from Albert Einstein. READ MORE: Scientists to make gravitational wave announcement 100 yrs after Einstein's theory of relativity Astrophysicists made a similar announcement last March and have been keeping more than just fellow scientists on their toes since then. It is obviously a complicated thing – otherwise it wouldn’t have taken so long to explore, right? So it’s OK not to know what everyone is so excited about. No worries, we're here to explain! 1. Einstein first mentioned gravitational waves in 1916 in his General Theory of Relativity. Scientists have been racking their brains over it since then. 2. The universe is like a huge trampoline. Einstein thought of it a space-time fabric. Gravitational waves are like ripples in that fabric. Want to know what Gravitational Waves are? Check out my new comic and video:https://t.co/Tu2ozFAVYkpic.twitter.com/ocATyNis75 Imagine dropping a melon versus a ping pong ball on that fabric. Which would 'sink' deeper? Exactly! The same happens in the universe: lighter objects create less of a ripple. 3. Gravitational waves were 'born' during the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago! Apparently, we still feel them, but they are minuscule. This is why detecting gravitational waves is important – they may hold the answer to the origins of the universe. 4. These gravitation waves are created when two or more huge objects bump into each other. via GIPHY For example, two black holes colliding would theoretically cause a massive ripple. 5. 'They do exist!' Or not. We have never detected gravitational waves directly and this is the main task. via GIPHY Detecting gravitational waves is simpler in theory than in practice. Space is so huge that the further ripples go the harder it is to catch them. 6. One of the ways to hunt for the waves is to measure stretches in space-time (that fabric from #2, remember?). For that, American scientists use a huge laser system,the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Its detectors - which look like laser 'rulers' - are meant to spot tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves. 7.LIGO reaches as far as up to 225 million light years away. It is so sensitive that it catches changes in the distance as small as 1/10,000 of the diameter of a proton. Advanced LIGO: Gravitational Wave Detectors Upgraded:https://t.co/IkksJGjhKCby LIGO, Caltech,@NSFpic.twitter.com/cXtcPJLAvt And even LIGO makes mistakes! In 2010, it was fooled by a fake signal... from scientists. However, six years ago it wasn't as advanced asnow, so let's not count that one. 8. We almost caught the gravity waves in 2014, but not quite. It was a false alarm, again. BICEP2, an observatory in Antarctica, right near the South Pole, thought it had netted the evidence for gravitational waves from the dawn of our universe, butno. If you still do not quite get what is happening, it's OK. First, it's a VERY short guide to a mystery as old as our universe. Second, scientists have been looking into it for 100 years since Einstein (so, add the time he spent, too!) and they are not there yet.

"10 Feb, 2016 16:53",Scientists to make gravitational wave announcement 100 yrs after Einstein's theory of relativity,"US scientists will make a presentation about the search for gravitational waves – and will possibly announce their discovery. Astronomers have been searching for decades, as they are one of the most important variables in Einstein's theory of relativity. The presentation – which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the publication of Einstein's theory of relativity – will take place at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, on Thursday. It will be conducted by Neil Cornish, a professor in the Department of Physics and co-director of the MSU eXtreme Gravity Institute. “Cornish will provide a status report on the effort to detect gravitational waves – or ripples in the fabric of spacetime – using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO),”the universitywrotein a press release. Advanced LIGO: Gravitational Wave Detectors Upgraded:https://t.co/IkksJGjhKCby LIGO, Caltech,@NSFpic.twitter.com/cXtcPJLAvt LIGO is a system of two detectors constructed to spot tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves. It was developed and built by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Caltech researchers, and funded by the National Science Foundation and other contributors. The identical detectors are located 1,865 miles apart, in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. The system is set up on the assumption that if a gravitational wave passes, it should stretch space in one direction and shrink it in the other. It looks out for those changes by splitting a laser beam in two and sending the beams from two distant locations. If the beams traveled the same distance when they return, they have not been distorted. However, if they do not align upon return, something has disrupted them during the journey – potentially gravitational waves. Rumors have been circulating for weeks that the instruments have picked up a signal, and that researchers are working on a paper about the discovery. Einstein believed, as do those who support his theory of relativity, published in 1916, that the universe is made up of a “fabric of spacetime.” It is believed that massive accelerating objects in the universe bend this fabric, and cause ripples known as gravitational waves. For instance, they can presumably be caused by two black holes colliding, or two pulsars merging. Astronomers have been searching for gravitational waves for decades, but have so far been unsuccessful. However, they are almost certain that they exist and are difficult to detect because by the time they reach Earth, the amount of spacetime movement they generate is incredibly small. The discovery of gravitational waves would be a huge milestone for scientists, as it would allow them to observe the universe in a whole new way. The ability to analyze the information carried on them would potentially provide more insight into the Big Bang and other violent events in the history of the universe. ""They will carry information about their origins that is free of the distortion or alteration suffered by electromagnetic radiation as it travels through millions of light years of intergalactic space. With this completely new way of examining astrophysical objects and phenomena, gravitational waves will truly open a new window on the Universe, providing astronomers and other scientists with their first glimpses of previously unseen and unseeable wonders, and greatly adding to our understanding of the nature of space and time itself,”the LIGO website says.

When Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, he propelled physics years forward and changed our understanding of how the universe works. He envisioned spacetime (a system containing three spatial dimensions and one time dimension) and gravity in a fresh way, showing us that spacetime was dynamic – not static – and that gravity warps spacetime in the presence of a massive object. READ MORE: Say cheese! Hubble telescope captures extraterrestrial smiley face Einstein further predicted that gravity travels in waves. These ripples are like a net that reacts to space events – star explosions, galaxy collisions, anything on a massive scale. The events create ripples that warp the fabric of spacetime. The bigger the objects, the greater the ripples. But the hunt for proof of the ripples has been on for decades. Einstein himself thought it would never amount to anything. That is – until now (we think). Because when famed theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and policy advocate Lawrence Krauss himself tweets the following message, people in the science community know not to take his words lightly. My earlier rumor about LIGO has been confirmed by independent sources. Stay tuned! Gravitational waves may have been discovered!! Exciting. LIGO – or Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory – is one of several active experiments aimed at detecting the elusive ripples. It’s recently gained an upgrade, dubbed Advanced LIGO. Completed last year, it is our latest and most promising stab at detection. But LIGO, as well as Krauss, also found cause for jubilation last year, after the launch of the new souped-up version. However, at the time Krauss only gave it a 10-15 percent chance, while the LIGO team had said it was still analyzing data, which was“the official response”citedby the journal Nature. READ MORE: Hubble captures first-ever predicted supernova blast (PHOTO) When website Gizmodo contacted Alan Weinstein at LIGO this time around, a similarly cold reaction was given:“My response to you is no more or less than the official one, which is the truth: ‘We are analyzing data and will share news when ready.’ I’d say that it is wisest to just be patient.” Loyola University physicist Robert McNees showed greater optimism. While tweeting  that“physics rumors on twitter are at best silly, and at worst bad for science,”he also added this: My prediction (which many others made) isn't really a prediction. Just confidence in a well-designed experiment & a very successful theory. McNees further cautioned that it’s very unlikely the LIGO people started the rumor, as it’s pretty much the last thing they would want. However, McNees’ subjective view was that we would, in fact, observe the ripples directly in 2016. He told Gizmodo the following via Twitter. “The best way to support these scientists is to let them carry out their experiments and analysis the way they were meant to be done. Let them take the time to do things the right way! And as physicists, I think we need to greet the inevitable rumors with explanations of how science works and why it’s so important to be careful. Even if that means having to wait for exciting news.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"30 Dec, 2015 14:22",Sperm bank accused of eugenics over flyer banning dyslexic donors,"Dyslexic donors have been turned away from Britain’s largest sperm bank in order to “minimize genetic diseases or malformations” in children. In a leaflet for potential donors, the London Sperm Bank listed dyslexia alongside a number of conditions that are deemed unacceptable among donors, including attention deficit disorder (ADD), Asperger’s and autism. The clinic was accused of practicing eugenics by a dyslexic man who was barred from donating. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates the industry, said it had “never required or endorsed prohibiting people with dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD, ADHD [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] and other disorders from becoming sperm donors.” Sperm & egg donations increasing risk of incest, Cambridge academic warnshttp://t.co/2rtDLoigO8pic.twitter.com/oC8KjtjrHN The regulator has launched a review of the clinic’s practices, as discriminating against people with conditions could be illegal. Dyslexic Oxford graduate Fred Fisher, 30, approached the clinic about donating sperm in November. “I was really taken aback to see dyslexia listed as a neurological disease,” he said. “I’d never thought they would turn people [away] for having dyslexia, especially given how important we are told science and entrepreneurship are these days.” Dyslexic spies: GCHQ’s secret strategy to tackle terrorism and espionagehttp://t.co/2XZMXiEoOs#GCHQpic.twitter.com/2s8Pr30pQK The London-based software engineer said dyslexic people make a “great contribution” to society. “I told them this was eugenics, but it’s not even good eugenics. Would they turn away Richard Branson or Albert Einstein? We need innovative people who think differently in the world. Dyslexic people make a great contribution to our society. “I would like the government and HFEA to be much clearer about ruling out this practice. And you could say the same for dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD,” he added. Dyslexia is a condition which can cause problems with reading, writing and spelling. However some academics see dyslexia as an advantage as people with the condition can have enhanced lateral thinking, spatial reasoning and pattern recognition. Prominent people with dyslexia include Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, and Tom Cruise. 'Gay, dyslexic activist' enters race for London mayorhttp://t.co/LP4m10ErKJpic.twitter.com/pj6Ty2xNAd JD Healthcare group quality manager Vanessa Smith said the clinic would review its practices. “The HFEA has been in touch with us. In response we will be reviewing all our practices and protocols,” she said. Smith said the organization had now withdrawn the leaflet setting out its ban and that the policy is under review. When Fisher asked why the clinic banned dyslexic donors, he was told this was HFEA policy – which is not the case. Smith said it was “unfortunate” that Fisher was given this “misinformation.” Dyslexics of the world should come together and untie to fight sperm donor discrimination. Dyslexia Foundation chair Steve O’Brien denounced the ban. “This is eugenics. It’s trying to say that dyslexics shouldn’t be in society. But we’re moving into a visually dominated world of Instagram and YouTube where given the right tools it is no longer an issue, because people with dyslexia are right-brained often with hyper-visual skills,” he said. “By suggesting you can’t donate sperm because you’re dyslexic will knock people’s confidence. This kind of stuff is what makes people shy away from admitting they have dyslexia and asking for help.” Smith denied the clinic practices eugenics and said they look for donors who are “medically clear of infectious diseases and genetic issues.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"17 Dec, 2015 17:42",Hubble captures first-ever predicted supernova blast (PHOTO),"NASA’s Hubble telescope has captured images of the first-ever predicted supernova blast, which actually happened 10 billion years ago. Many stars end their lives as supernovas, which are blasts caused by too much mass accumulated during a star’s life, often pared by a lack of fuel to burn it. A few supernovas have so far been caught on lens, but all of them were due to sheer luck. But on December 11, astronomers not only imaged a supernova in action, but also saw it approximately when and where they had predicted it would be. The exploded star – dubbed Refsdal in honor of Norwegian astronomer Sjur Refsdal – was first spotted last November in the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223. Four separate images of the supernova captured at that time showed a rare arrangement known as an Einstein Cross.  After the blast, which actually took place 10 billion years ago, the light traveled in various directions around a gravitationally-warped region of space, taking about five billion years to reach us. “While studying the supernova, we realized that the galaxy in which it exploded is already known to be a galaxy that is being lensed [distorted] by the cluster,” said Steve Rodney, study co-author from the University of South Carolina. “The supernova’s host galaxy appears to us in at least three distinct images caused by the warping mass of the galaxy cluster,”he noted. Warped regions were first described by Albert Einstein and appear thanks to massive galaxy clusters that bend space and time. The matter in such regions is distributed unevenly, so it sends light via various paths of different lengths. The result is that the images of the host galaxy of the supernova are visible at different times, and scientists say that the lensed region of space would trigger more images of the supernova to emerge over the next five years. “We used seven different models of the cluster to calculate when and where the supernova was going to appear in the future. Remarkably, all seven models predicted approximately the same time frame,”said physicist Tommaso Treu, with the University of California at Los Angeles.

"14 Dec, 2015 14:33","Alcohol may lower Alzheimer's risk, stress increases it in older people - studies","High levels of stress in older people contributes to Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study. But don't let the news stress you out – separate research suggests two to three drinks a day can lower the risk of death from the disease. Astudyby researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the Montefiore Health System followed 507 people enrolled in the Einstein Aging Study, a group of adults aged 70 or older who live in the Bronx borough of New York. ""Our study provides strong evidence that perceived stress increases the likelihood that an older person will develop [amnestic mild cognitive impairment],”lead researcher Dr. Richard Lipton said in a press release. The volunteers underwent neuropsychological tests, clinical evaluations, examinations of medical histories and evaluations of daily activities. The participants also had their stress levels evaluated by the researchers using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The volunteers were given scores from zero to 56, with higher numbers indicating increased levels of perceived stress. They were tracked for an average of 3.6 years. The findings – published in the journal Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Disorders – showed that those in the highest quintile of five PSS tiers were found to be two-and-a-half times more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment, which is often a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. The study also found that for every five points a person scored under the Perceived Stress Scale, the risk of cognitive impairment increased by 30 percent. However, study author Mindy Katz noted that perceived stress and the risks associated with it can be“altered by mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive-behavioral therapies and stress-reducing drugs,”adding that“these interventions may postpone or even prevent an individual’s cognitive decline.” Meanwhile, a separate body ofresearch, the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY), has concluded that moderate alcohol consumption can lower the risk of dying from the disease. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, analyzed data collected on 330 people with early stage dementia or Alzheimer's and their primary carers, all of whom resided in Denmark. That data included information on how much alcohol each person drank every day. The researchers determined that consumption of two to three units of alcohol each day was associated with a 77 percent lower risk of death compared with one or fewer daily units, after analyzing data from the 53 individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease who died during the study. The results held true when other factors – including age, gender, other underlying conditions, education, quality of life and living situation – were taken into effect. The scientists said there could be several explanations for the findings, including that people who drink moderately have a richer social network, which has been linked to improved quality – and possibly length – of life. Another explanation was the potential for reverse causality, meaning that those drinking very little alcohol were already in the terminal phase of their life – which would have artificially associated the positive effect of alcohol in patients.

"8 Dec, 2015 10:39",A world without RT? That’s just what the Western war lobby wants,"What would a world without RT look like? Well, just consider what the media landscape looked like before RT first appeared in 2005. I remember clearly the ease with which neocons and even the ‘decent’ left were able to push the case for war in Iraq in 2003. is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Pro-war commentators gotdeferential treatmenton BBC news/current affairs programs (as they still do) with nobody asking the one question that millions of us watching at home were pondering: If our leaders really did believe that Saddam had WMDs that could be launched within 45 minutes, then why were they so keen to do the one thing that would force the ‘monstrous dictator’ to use them – namely, invade his country? A five-year-old could have seen through the great Iraq WMDs charade pushed by Blair and Bush, but with stony, serious faces the western broadcast media presented a neocon conspiracy theory as fact, and up to 1m people died. Since RT arrived on the scene, the western elites and their media stenographers have found it much harder to peddle their lies. At last we have a news channel that can properly challenge the propaganda of the war hawks - not by pumping out counter propaganda but simply by reporting things as they are. A modern, slick channel with highly professional presenters and reporters who know their territory very well, one which also gives a voice to experts and pundits marginalized by the New McCarthyites at home who try and enforce a mind-numbing uniformity on foreign policy issues. 80% of Greeks want alternative non-MSM coverage of intl news - pollhttp://t.co/kSscHagCaSpic.twitter.com/XwHbBRPY2N Whilewestern channelswere hailing NATO’s bombing of Libya and the toppling of Gaddafi as a ‘great success’, it was pundits on RT whowarnedthat the country which had the highest living standards in Africa would become a failed state and magnet for extremists- which is exactly what happened. On Syria, RT was the first toreporton how radical jihadist terror groups wereplaying the leading rolein the war against the Syrian government - but of course this was all dismissed as ‘Russian propaganda’. All the ‘rebels’ were nice, cuddly pro- democracy activists was the ‘official’ western line. Only when IS started to get a bit too big for its boots, did the official narrative change. RT pundits - myself included - also said that Assad government was not about to fall in 2011/12 (as neocon politicians and ‘experts’ were telling us), but in fact had sizable public support. Again, who was telling the truth and who was peddling propaganda? The fact that RT has made it harder for the western war lobby to hoodwink the public has inevitably put the station in the line of fire. In Britain the attacks on RT have intensified since the successful launch of RTUK in October 2014. As I’ve noted before, if you look at who is at the forefront of the attacks on RT you will see a very strong overlap between those who want RT ‘sanctioned’ and those who supported and propagandized for the Iraq war and other western ‘military interventions’ of recent years. It’s far too much of an overlap to be a coincidence. These Iraq-war supportingRT-bashers, tell us on the one hand that the channel is a disgrace, it’s a ‘fake’ news station whose pundits/guests are extremists/ neoNazis/ communists/Stalinists/far-left/far-right/ genocide deniers/conspiracy theorists (they choose whichever smear they think works best on the particular occasion), and on the other hand they ridicule RT as a channel which nobody watches! You don’t have to be an Einstein to see the contradiction here - if no one is watching RT, why do these people spend so much time and energy attacking it and calling for the regulators to take ‘strong action’ against it? You're very, very foolish if you even remotely believe we live in a society that honors and respects and believes in The First Amendment. Genuinely independent experts and pundits who struggle to get a proper hearing in their own countries because their views differ from the prevailing elite neocon orthodoxy, would find it harder to get their message out to a large, global audience if RT did not exist. In fact a world without RT would be worse that the media landscape we had before 2003 because McCarthyism is stronger now in the west than it was back then. The Iraq war and the blatant lies told in its lead-up should have led to the propagandists for that war being showing the red card- but as Peter Obornedescribedthe opposite has happened - it is those who were right on Iraq and who told the truth who have become marginalized and subject to relentless attacks and smears by those who cheer-leaded on behalf of the illegal war. John Pilger, for instance, the greatest investigate journalist and reporter of his generation, used to be a regular on British television screens from the 1970s until the Noughties. He wrote for the mainstream media and had a regular column in the New Statesman. But today Pilger is an outcast in the British media - and if you want to see this award-winning legendary journalist on the TV you have to tune in to RT and catch him on programs likeGoing Underground. What a terrible indictment it is of the current media landscape in the West that a truth-telling journalist like Pilger, who’s been uncannily accurate about every big conflict of the last twenty/thirty years, has effectively been blacklisted. The Western elite are upset because they know the growing popularity of RT makes it harder for them to control the narrative. The hawks don’t mind Al Jazeera because although that channel's coverage of Israel/Palestine differs from western news channels, it does take the ’right’ line on Syria, and other foreign policy issues, reflecting that the interests of Qatar and western elites do coincide. But by broadcasting the truth behind western military interventions, and revealing the ‘hidden agenda’ to television viewers, RT is viewed as meddlesome. In the next few years, one thing’s for sure - we’re going to need RT more than ever. Indeed, the West is hoping to attract Russian-speakers in Europe in an effort to get audiences to toe the Western line in global hotspots like Syria, where the US is being accused by Russia of beingsuspiciously indifferentto the rise of Islamic State, for example. ""Nordic countries are offering broadcast rights to television shows to be dubbed into Russian. Germany is providing Russian-language news and documentaries. U.S. diplomats are trying to broker content deals with American movie studios,""The Wall Street Journalreported. A world without RT, and one in which only neocon/’Decent Left’ officially approved ‘experts and pundits' could appear on our television screens, would make this truly fascistic, imperialist agenda easier to achieve. We must make sure that never happens and that the people who want us to ‘question less' and deferentially accept an elite narrative based on lies never succeed.

"27 Nov, 2015 17:34",Former UN official urges Cameron not to bomb Syria ahead of protests,"Former UN Assistant Secretary-General Hans von Sponeck has signed a letter along with 30 other VIPs begging Prime Minister David Cameron not to bomb Syria. It will be delivered to Downing Street on Saturday as thousands protest at Whitehall. Thirty celebrities, politicians and writers have signed the letter pleading with Cameron to reverse his plans to extend airstrikes against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants from Iraq into Syria. Signatories include filmmaker Ken Loach and comedian Frankie Boyle. The letter will be delivered to Downing Street at Saturday’s protest, according to the Stop the War coalition. “The UK has been bombing countries for a decade and a half, at the cost of millions of lives. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results meets Albert Einstein’s definition of madness,” the group said. “We are calling on all our groups to organize protests in their towns and cities on the same day. We need to resist this brutalizing and dehumanizing spiral of violence.” 30,000 have used 2-minute lobby to tell their MP: DON'T BOMB SYRIA. Join them nowhttps://t.co/FQToNW9Ivipic.twitter.com/zEJgwYw2yl On Thursday, the PM insisted launching UK airstrikes against IS militants in Syria will “make us safer.” He warned Britain will “never be safe” until IS is defeated.However, Cameron denied claims it would make the UK a bigger target for terror attacks. “The threats to our interests and to our people are such that we cannot afford to stand aside and not to act,” the PM told the House of Commons. “Throughout Britain’s history we have been called on time and again to make the hardest of decisions in defense of our citizens and our country. Today one of the greatest threats we face to our security is the threat from ISIL,” he added. Stop the War vice-chair Chris Nineham dismissed the PM’s comments and said he had “failed utterly” to outline a coherent strategy. “We always get this argument when we are asked to back another war, that our weapons don’t kill civilians, that they are precision-guided, that they cause minimal ‘collateral damage’. And yet all the facts argue the opposite: one impact of extra bombing raids will be more civilians killed. Why on earth would Britain want to increase the death rate?” he told the Guardian. Nineham condemned Cameron’s plans and said bombing Syria would “entrench the bitterness towards the west.” “The kind of action Cameron is outlining is going to increase the level of suffering and destruction in Syria, it’s liable to entrench the civil war [and] to strengthen rather than degrade the position of ISIS,” he added.

"2 Nov, 2015 18:00","97% of small children have used mobile device, most have their own – study","Say goodbye to the days of puzzles and outdoor play – children these days are being kept occupied by more sophisticated toys. New research has found that a staggering 97 percent of US children under the age of four use mobile devices, regardless of family income. Theresearch– published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday – studied 350 children in a low-income, minority community. The findings noted an“almost universal exposure”to mobile devices, indicating that such technological luxuries are not limited to financially well-off families. In fact, the parents' education and the child's gender and ethnicity did not play a role in whether a child owned a mobile device. The child participants were between six months and four years of age. The older the children were, the more likely they were to have their own technology. By age four, about three-quarters had their own mobile device, and half had their own TV. Ninety-seven percent were found to have used a mobile device, and about half frequently multi-tasked, using more than one device at the same time. The study also found that 20 percent of one-year-olds have their own tablet computer, and that 28 percent of two-year-olds can navigate a mobile device without help. Study author Dr. Matilde Irigoyen, chair of the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine at Albert Einstein Medical Center, said she was“surprised by some of the findings.” “We were very surprised to see how often the children used the mobile devices, how many of them owned a personal device, how many could use the device without assistance, and how many engaged in media multitasking,”Irigoyen said. But the impressive set of skills shown at such an early age shouldn't necessarily be surprising – because the study found that most children begin using mobile devices before their first birthday. This was partly due to parents relying on such devices to occupy their children while they did chores, were out in public places, or running errands. In addition, 28 percent of parents said they use a mobile device to put their children to sleep. The research also found that most households surveyed had televisions (97 percent), tablets (83 percent), and smartphones (77 percent). Just over half had video consoles (56 percent), a computer (58 percent), and internet access at home (59 percent). Irigoyen said the idea for the study grew after physicians observed the behavior of families in a clinic waiting room. ""In the clinic, in the practice, we're seeing every mother, every father, every adult come in, and they pull out their cellphones,""she said, as quoted by USA Today. She added that parents often use mobile devices to entertain their children in the waiting room. The study consisted of a 20-question survey of 289 parents of 350 children in an urban, low-income, minority community. Questions were answered about the children's use of television, mobile devices, computers, and video games. The children had visited a Philadelphia pediatric clinic in October and November of 2014. The findings did not address the impact that mobile devices have on children and their families, Irigoyen said, adding that“they simply describe the pervasive nature of digital exposure and the patterns of use."" The study authors have stressed the need for further research in order to update guidelines and recommendations for the use of mobile devices by young children. The new research suggests that mobile device use among children is on the rise. In 2013, a similar study by Common Sense Media found that ownership of tablet devices among families with children aged eight and under was just 40 percent at that time, and that 75 percent of children had access to some type of “smart” mobile device.

"7 Oct, 2015 06:20","Japanese, Canadian physicists receive Nobel Prize for pinning mysterious neutrino particles","The 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics has been awarded to two researchers working independently, in Canada and Japan, on the discovery of neutrino oscillations, proving that elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos have mass. Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald won for their efforts in demonstrating that neutrinos change identities, known as“flavors,”the academy said. Neutrinos are one of the basic particles that make up matter.“After photons, the particles of light, neutrinos are the most numerous in the entire cosmos. The Earth is constantly bombarded by them,”the academy said in its statement announcing the prize. ”Kind of unbelievable!” Takaaki Kajita on being awarded the 2015#NobelPrizein Physicshttps://t.co/4GlcphyGjc The neutrinos transform between three types: electron-type, muon-type and tau-type. In order to change from one state to the other neutrinos need to have mass, which challenges the belief that that they were massless. The discovery had“changed our understanding of the innermost workings of matter and can prove crucial to our view of the universe,”the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Congratulations to#queensuProf Emeritus Art McDonald, winner of an@NobelPrizefor Physicshttp://t.co/cxsPcSM11tpic.twitter.com/9phjYB8FrQ Kajita is director of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research at the University of Tokyo and McDonald is professor emeritus at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “When I took the phone call and heard that they’d decided on the prize, it was a huge honor. I’m still so shocked I don’t really know what to say,”Kajita told said at a news conference in Tokyo. ”It’s ironic, in order to observe the sun you have to go kilometers under ground.” Arthur McDonald:https://t.co/HEt4wAqa2c#NobelPrize Kajita described his work as demonstrating a new kind of physics beyond the Standard Model of fundamental particles, which requires for neutrinos to be massless. Kajita helped prove in 1998 that neutrinos locked inside the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan experienced a metamorphosis in the atmosphere. McDonald’s contribution included a 2001 discovery that neutrinos from the sun also changed their identities. The Canadian scientists completed his work at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, SNOLAB. Let's be proud of our fellow Arthur B. McDonald for his@NobelPrizein Physics, an accomplished scientist and Officer of the#OrderofCanada. “Yes, there certainly was a Eureka moment in this experiment when we were able to see that neutrinos appeared to change from one type to the other in traveling from the Sun to the Earth,”McDonald told reporters by telephone from his home in Kingston. Neutrinos are“particles that we don’t know how to subdivide any further,”McDonald said. “By our measurements we were able to confirm with great accuracy calculations of how the Sun burns by fusion processes,”McDonald said. There is still work left to be done in this field, including learning the exact mass of the neutrino, and whether more than the currently known three types exist. The neutrino scientists spent most of their research time deep in the ground because they need to keep away from interference from cosmic and other radiation. “Many neutrinos are created in reactions between cosmic radiation and the Earth’s atmosphere. Others are produced in nuclear reactions inside the Sun. Thousands of billions of neutrinos are streaming through our bodies each second. Hardly anything can stop them passing; neutrinos are nature’s most elusive elementary particles,”the academy said in its statement. Previous winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics include Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Marie Curie. The Nobel Prize for Medicine in medicine was awarded Monday to Tu Youyou, William Campbell and Satoshi Omura for their work in developing treatments for diseases including malaria. Other winners for chemistry, literature and peace categories will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be revealed on October 12.

"17 Sep, 2015 15:21",Cosmic collision: Supermassive black holes to crash sooner than predicted,"A huge galactic collision will be taking place sooner than predicted, according to a new study. Two supermassive black holes are edging closer to a crash – and that impact will be so strong it will send violent ripples through the fabric of space-time. The two supermassive black holes – known as quasar PG 1302-102 – are three-and-a-half billion light years from Earth, in the Virgo constellation. The duo is separated by just one light week – and while that may seem like a great distance, it's actually quite close by space standards, considering the next closest known pair of black holes are 20 light years apart. They were initially discovered in January, when astronomers noticed an unusual bright spot of UV light coming from the center of the galaxy. At the time of discovery, scientists said they expected the two to crash into each other in 250,000 years. What black hole and house thermostat have in common: NASA explainshttp://t.co/kB9Dczoltypic.twitter.com/RmcuDLZVag But now, using new calculations, researchers from Columbia University say the collision is likely to take place earlier - although still not anytime close to our lifetime. According to new data, it could take place in around 100,000 years. The observations werepublishedin the journal Nature. Focusing on PG 1302-102 because of its brightness, the team hypothesized that if the two black holes were as close as predicted, one had to be circling the other at a 10th of the speed of light. They predicted they would find a five-year cycle in the pair's ultraviolet emissions, which is exactly what happened. They then estimated and combined the relative mass of the two black holes to narrow down the timescale of the predicted collision. #NASAdiscovers ‘smallest supermassive’ black hole everhttp://t.co/BtxuCvjx1Fpic.twitter.com/Y5K9ZPo2aB When the collision occurs, it could release as much energy as 100 million supernova explosions in the form of violent ripples. However, scientists are not predicting any apocalyptic consequences for our part of the galaxy. On the contrary, the crash will be highly beneficial for astronomers of the far, far future, as it will allow them to observe the gravitational waves predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago. “The detection of gravitational waves lets us probe the secrets of gravity and test Einstein’s theory in the most extreme environment in our universe — black holes,”said the study’s lead author, Daniel D’Orazio, a graduate student at Columbia, in a statement.“Getting there is a holy grail of our field.” However, there is a chance science won't have to wait 100,000 years to witness the phenomenon. PG 1302-102 is one of 20 pairs of black hole candidates that have been found by scientists. Researchers hope to find more colliding black holes and believe they may be able to witness a crash within the next 10 years, according to the International Business Times.

"6 Aug, 2015 11:08","Did US nuke Hiroshima, Nagasaki to advance 'imperialistic goals'?","When the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, it turned the clock on human progress back centuries. Seven decades on it still symbolizes the twisted morality of those for whom conflict remains the natural state of human existence. 'The B-29 bomber the ‘Enola Gay’ arrived over Hiroshima early on that summer’s morning carrying a nuclear payload symbolizing the exaltation of death, destruction, and brute force as the summit of an Enlightenment, which had ushered into being the liberal values that underpin Western democracy. They were encapsulated by the painter Pablo Picasso, who said of the event,“The genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.” That the dropping of the bomb was justified in the cause of those democratic values merely adds another layer of insanity to what by any measure was one of the greatest crimes in human history. Those who defend the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, followed by a second bomb on Nagasaki days later, assert that they actually saved lives in bringing a speedier end to the war than would have occurred otherwise. They cite the heavy casualties US forces suffered during the series of battles to take control of the Pacific islands that lay between Hawaii and Japan, a casualty rate which suggested that a land invasion of Japan itself would exact a terrible price on the troops, convinced that the fanatical resistance by the Japanese army hitherto would be even more fanatical when it came to defending mainland Japan. However this view was refuted by General Douglas McArthur, the top US commander in the Pacific, who said that the Japanese were“already beaten”by the time of the bomb, a view endorsed by the head of US air operations in the Pacific, General Curtis LeMay, who asserted that,“Even without the atomic bomb and the Russian entry into the war, Japan would have surrendered in two weeks.” McArthur and LeMay had good reason to hold this view, as by the time of Hiroshima the country’s military was both exhausted and decimated, while Japan’s infrastructure had been almost completely destroyed. Compounding the sense of defeat was the prospect of a Soviet invasion erupting across its northern border, what with Germany defeated months previously and the complete attention of the Allies having now turned to the Pacific theater. Indeed, the scale of destruction and the loss of civilian life as a consequence of the US conventional bombing campaign that had been waged against Japan in the weeks and months previously qualified as a war crime by itself. The fire-bombing of Tokyo on March 9-10, 1945, for example, involved 334 aircraft dropping incendiary bombs consisting of napalm, thermite, and white phosphorous. An estimated 100,000 people were killed and thousands more injured, many horrifically. Curtis LeMay, rather than lamenting, gloried in the carnage it wrought, revealing that the victims were“scorched and boiled and baked to death.” Over a hundred Japanese cities were fire-bombed prior to Hiroshima, prompting future US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, a member of LeMay’s staff, to conclude that, had the United States lost the war, ‘they’ would all be charged as war criminals. From the scientists and engineers who applied themselves to the task of creating and building the world’s first atomic bomb, to the pilots and aircrew who flew it to its target, doing so in the knowledge of the awful destruction it would unleash, it is still difficult to comprehend the ability of so many to carry out a process with such a horrific objective in mind. Yet by then the Japanese had been so dehumanized and demonized by US propaganda there was little if any sympathy when it came to slaughtering them in large numbers. The brutal atrocities committed by the Japanese armed forces against prisoners of war and people under their occupation fed a narrative depicting all Japanese – men, women, and children – as subhuman whose extermination was justified.  Most of all, what must be understood about the inordinate resources applied to creating the world’s first nuclear bomb by the United States was less to do with defeating Japan in World War II and more to do with ensuring US world domination in the aftermath. This was the view held by the Soviet Union’s Marshal Zhukov, who in his memoirs reflected that,“It was clear already then that the US Government intended to use the atomic bomb for the purpose of achieving its imperialist goals.” The intended message was certainly received loud and clear in Moscow, as within days of the bomb being dropped the Soviets embarked on a crash program to develop their own bomb, thus joining a nuclear arms race that over ensuing decades saw untold money and resources given over to researching and developing ever more destructive bombs and missiles that could have been applied to curing disease, ending hunger, poverty and creating a world founded on peace and justice rather than the one we have known and know today, punctuated by war, conflict, mistrust and fear. For the men who actually flew the mission to drop the world’s first atomic bomb, known as ‘Little Boy’, over Hiroshima, the sight and spectacle was something they would never forget. Abe Spitzer, a radioman on an accompanying aircraft, described it as“a dozen colors, all of them blindingly bright, and in the center the brightest of all, a gigantic red ball of flame that seemed larger than the sun.”Meanwhile, the co-pilot o the Enola Gay itself, Robert Lewis, wrote in his flight log:“My God! What have we done?’ For those on the ground, words such as ‘spectacle’ do not come close to describing the unimaginable horror they experienced. Hiroshima at that time was a city of approximately 300,000 civilians, 43,000 soldiers and 45,000 Korean slave laborers. There were also several thousand Japanese-Americans living in the city, mostly children whose parents had been interned in the United States. Thousands were killed instantly, completely incinerated, while an estimated 140,000 died as a result of the bomb by the end of the year from their injuries or radiation poisoning. By 1950 this figure had increased to 200,000. The scale of the destruction and carnage did not concern US President Harry S Truman, however, who upon receiving news of the mission while dining aboard the USS Augusta, is said to have jumped up from the table and exclaimed,“This is the greatest thing in history.” Perhaps the words of Japanese poet, Sankichi Toge, who survived Hiroshima, offer a more apt description of the event than those of President Truman. In his poem titled ‘August Sixth’, Sankichi writes: How could I ever forget that flash of light!In an instant thirty thousand people disappeared from the streets;The cries of fifty thousand moreCrushed beneath the darkness… Then, skin, hanging like rags,Hands on breasts:Treading upon shattered human brains… Years later, towards the end of his presidency, Truman hosted a private dinner attended by Britain’s Winston Churchill, the wartime prime minister. At one point, according to Truman’s daughter, Churchill turned to the president and said,“Mr. President, I hope you have your answer ready for the hour when you and I stand before St. Peter and he says, ‘I understand you two are responsible for putting off those atomic bombs. What have you got to say for yourselves?’” There is no record of Truman’s response.

"6 Aug, 2015 10:16",Quantum scientists create 'quietest-ever gas',"Scientists have created a gas with the lowest-ever level of entropy, which will help the study of elusive quantum effects and potentially create new high-temperature superconductors. Entropy measures how ordered or disordered a system is, with lower entropy corresponding to more order. A room-full of people all speaking at the same time would be disordered, the noise makes picking out individual voices harder. In thermodynamics, cooling down a system would be equivalent to hushing the hum. At a certain point enough atoms in a cooling gas would reach the state of lowest energy possible to allow quantum effects to manifest at a macroscopic level. The gas exhibiting such properties is called Bose-Einstein condensate after physicists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein who predicted it. Measuring one nanoKelvin, or one billionth of a degree above absolute zero, the Bose-Einstein condensate created at the University of California, Berkeley has entropy about 100 times lower than in previous experiments and is the quietest gas ever made. Fizzy bubble floating aboard Intl Space Station shot by NASA new 6K camera (VIDEO)http://t.co/4y36BBLwVtpic.twitter.com/NmOb8At8wG It consists of about a million atoms of rubidium trapped by a beam of light and isolated in a vacuum. Temperatures twice as low have been achieved, but in this case the temperature was cold enough to have an overwhelming majority of the atoms get to the lowest energy state. ""Temperature generates something like a constant rumble of sound in the gas, and the entropy is like a count of how many sound-wave excitations remain. The colder a gas becomes, the less entropy it has and the quieter it is,""the research co-author Dan Stamper-Kurn, a UC Berkeley professor of physics, told PhysOrg. With so little noise, researchers hope they will be able to study subtle quantum effects and get a better understanding of complex quantum structures, such as quantum magnets. A potential field of research is high-temperature superconductors - materials that can conduct electricity without resistance at relatively high temperatures. ""One of the holy grails of modern physics is to understand these exotic materials well enough to design one that is superconducting without requiring any cooling at all,""said UC Berkeley graduate student Ryan Olf. ""By studying the properties of low-entropy gases in various configurations, our community of researchers hope to learn what makes these fascinating materials work the way they do,""he added. Measuring the temperature of the super quiet gas was a technical challenge in its own right. The team had to develop a special thermometer that read properties of tilted magnetization of atom spins.

"9 Jul, 2015 11:29",Justice Ministry to add Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia NGO to list of undesirable groups - report,"A new Russian list suggesting 12 undesirable foreign organizations will soon be expanded to 20 groups and include the Open Russia NGO sponsored by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Izvestia daily reports. In an article published on Thursday, Izvestia quoted unnamed,
  high-placed sources in the Upper House as saying the Justice
  Ministry is preparing amendments to the “stop-list” approved by
  the Federation council and had forwarded it to the Prosecutor
  General’s office on Wednesday. The added groups will include the Ford Foundation, the Jamestown
  Foundation, the Eurasia Foundation, and the Albert Einstein
  Institute. The Justice Ministry is also seeking a ban on the
  Russian activities of the Open Russia association, created and
  sponsored by former oil tycoon and staunch opposition figure
  Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the sources said. “This will not be the end, the network of foundations that
  implement the politics of the US State Department is quite
  ramified and our list will be expanded,” added the
  high-placed Upper House official. The head of the Federation Council’s International Relations
  Committee, Konstantin Kosachev, said in comments that the
  creation of the stop-list was “a start of the public
  discussion and not its end” and stressed that the whole
  project was not targeted against Russia’s civil society or its
  partners abroad. The senator said the main objective of the new
  law was to “create a barrier against the forces that openly
  demand regime change in Russia.” READ MORE: Upper house approves first list of 12
  ‘undesirable’ foreign groups In May, the Justice Ministry initiated the prosecutors’ probe
  into the Open Russia public movement in order to clarify its ties
  with former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and foreign
  sponsorship. In April, MP Aleksandr Sidyakin, who represents the
  parliamentary majority United Russia party, asked law enforcers
  to check if the Open Russia public movement could be categorized
  as a foreign agent, and, if so, to see that it duly registers as
  such. However, any legal action against the group is complicated by the
  fact that it is not officially registered as a legal entity and
  therefore it has never come under the Justice Ministry’s radar. The Open Russia NGO was founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his
  close allies in 2001. After Khodorkovsky was tried and sentenced
  for large-scale tax evasion, the organization ceased to exist,
  but when the former Yukos boss was pardoned and released in
  December 2013, Open Russia was re-launched as a network structure
  aiming to assist the “Europe-oriented part of Russian
  society.” The Law on Undesirable Foreign Organizations came into force in
  early June. This stipulates that the Prosecutor General’s Office
  and the Foreign Ministry make a list of undesirable organizations
  and outlaw their activities, including the distribution of
  information materials or any cooperation with Russian citizens or
  legal entities. Violation of the ban is punishable with heavy
  fines, or even prison terms in cases of repeated or aggravated

"7 Jul, 2015 04:44","​London’s 7/7 terror tragedy, 10 years on: British foreign policy encourages attacks","As the 10th anniversary of the most deadly terrorist attack ever to be carried out in Britain – the 7/7 attacks on the London underground and transport systems – is recalled, UK policy has since made the prospects of another 7/7 more, not less, likely. The 30 British victims of the most recent Islamist terrorist
  attack in Tunisia are a damning indictment of Britain’s efforts
  to combat terrorism in the ten years since the 7/7 attack took
  place in London – an tragedy which claimed 52 lives and left 700
  people injured. Indeed, the massacre in Tunisia is proof that
  rather than another major terrorist attack in Britain being less
  likely today, ten years on from 7/7, it is more likely. The
  British Government’s ill-planned and ill-conceived interventions
  in the Middle East over the past decade, combined with the
  campaign of demonization that has been rolled out against Muslims
  at home, has fanned the flames of radicalization rather than the
  opposite. Ever since embarking on the disastrous and illegal war against
  Iraq in 2003, members of the British establishment have
  consistently denied any connection between UK foreign policy and
  the rising tide of Islamist extremism and terrorism at home and
  abroad. There can only be two explanations for such a denial –
  madness or mendacity. Many would suggest that it’s a case of
  both. READ MORE: ‘It can and will happen here’:
  Counter-terror officers draw somber conclusions from 7/7 Whatever the reason, the truth cannot be denied: UK foreign
  policy and efforts to combat terrorism have not merely failed,
  they have failed catastrophically, in the process endangering
  British citizens at home and overseas, large chunks of which are
  now no-go areas for tourists or people visiting. Compounding the cognitive dissonance – or to be more frank,
  ‘insanity’ – that underpins this policy, is the prospect of the
  Britain now carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. This,
  if it goes ahead, will only make the problem worse, precisely as
  it has in both Iraq and Libya already. Indeed, only a fool could fail to grasp the connection between
  the NATO air campaign to topple Gaddafi in Libya in 2011, and the
  proliferation of terrorism and terrorist groups that now exist in
  that country. The terrorists responsible for the Tunisian attack
  we know trained in Libya, and no such terrorist training network
  existed in Libya until NATO decided to intervene and topple the
  Libyan leader. The result of that intervention was not the
  flowering of democracy in a North African country, but its
  descent into an abyss of lawless violence and extremism. Given
  that Britain was an eager participant in this NATO air campaign
  in Libya, the British political establishment is therefore
  culpable in the murder of those British tourists recently
  slaughtered in Tunisia. An important point must be made with regard to potential British
  airstrikes being carried out in Syria, an inconvenient fact
  ‘they’ would rather is forgotten. It is that Syria is a sovereign
  state, recognized as such by the UN, and that consequently
  airstrikes carried out without the prior consent, cooperation, or
  permission of the Syrian Government would be a violation of the
  country’s sovereignty and, with it, a violation of international
  law. The British Government’s response to the mass murder of its
  citizens with airstrikes in Syria would amount to a panicked
  knee-jerk reaction on the part of a political class that no
  longer knows its backside from its elbow. What makes these people
  believe the Royal Air Force can succeed where its US counterpart
  has failed over the course of many months of airstrikes against
  ISIS in both Syria and Iraq?  ISIS will and can only be defeated with a combination of
  airstrikes and land forces taking back the territory it currently
  occupies. This means a combined military campaign that includes
  boots on the ground. Those boots are already on the ground. They
  belong to the Syrian Army and its Hezbollah allies, along with
  the Iraqi Army and the various Shia and pro-government militias
  that are fighting alongside it. Britain, the West, needs as a matter of urgency to reorient its
  strategy to embrace an alliance with all forces engaged in
  fighting ISIS and the medieval ideology it represents. The threat
  it poses to the region, and by extension the wider world, demands
  nothing less. The problem is of course that governments in the West have spent
  the last few years doing all they can to undermine the Assad
  regime, characterizing it as evil and brutal, even though ‘evil’
  and ‘brutal’ are words more suitable to describe ISIS and the
  various other Islamist organizations that are intent on turning
  the country into a graveyard for minorities, both Muslim and
  non-Muslim, rather than a government which believes in modernity,
  the separation of politics and religion, and upholds the rights
  of said minorities. A simpler way of putting this is that whatever anyone thinks of
  Bashar al-Assad, his government is not in the business of
  slaughtering tourists on beaches in North Africa. Syria, along with Russia and the rest of the sane world has been
  calling for an international coalition to combat terrorism for
  years now. So far the call has fallen on deaf ears. Instead, the
  British Government has continued with a strategy that has been
  responsible for deepening the crisis rather than alleviating it.
  Regional alliances with the likes of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and
  other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council make a mockery of
  its oft-repeated claims to be motivated by human rights and
  democracy. As Churchill, a committed opponent of communism his entire life,
  said when explaining his decision to join forces with the Soviet
  Union to fight Nazi Germany, he would“make at least a
  favorable reference to the devil”if Hitler invaded hell. Even though many would assert that it was the Soviet Union that
  made a ‘pact with the devil’ in joining forces with Britain and
  the US against the Nazis, this is the kind of political wisdom
  that is so desperately needed now in Downing Street if there are
  to be no more 7/7-type terrorist attacks in London and attacks
  against British tourists abroad. Nobody should hold his or her breath waiting for it to occur. As

Congress has approved funds for the conflict for months, while dodging discussion of its status. Calling Congress the “poster child for cowardice”,
  Representative Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) proposed a “concurrent

  debate whether or not to authorize it?” McGovern asked on

  of the resources they need to succeed. But somehow, there’s

  leadership of both the House and the Senate has criticized the
  proposal without offering an alternative. “If this House doesn’t have the stomach to carry out its
  Constitutional duty to debate and authorize this latest war, then
  we should bring our troops home,” McGovern said. “If the

"22 Apr, 2015 02:59",Earth-wide telescope built to watch Milky Way black hole,"Scientists might soon get closer to understanding the nature of the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole. To observe its mysterious event horizon, they are connecting a planet-wide system of telescopes that will “see” 1,000 times better than Hubble. Work is underway on creating the global Event Horizon Telescope
  (EHT), which will become the first-of-a-kind instrument to take
  detailed pictures of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A-star,
  the US National Science Foundation reported on Tuesday.The telescope is destined to prove that black holes do have
  so-called event horizons – borders, from which even light cannot
  escape the immense gravity. That is why the black hole itself is
  most likely to remain invisible – or simply a dark silhouette. Sagittarius A-star exceeds the mass of our sun by four million
  times, yet it looks tiny, comparable to“standing in
  California and reading the date on a penny in New York,”according to thepress-release New Telescope to Take First-Ever Black Hole Photo.http://t.co/prZgCIgCi0blackholespic.twitter.com/Y11YRFSYW1 — shivr20 (@shivr20)January
    18, 2015 But the EHT will make it possible to observe new details, as its
  resolution will be 1,000 times clearer than the Hubble Telescope.In one of the preliminary experiments, another black hole was
  observed in Centaurus A galaxy, located 10 million light years
  away. This was achieved by combining two telescopes – the SPT
  [South Pole Telescope] at the NSF South Pole research station and
  the APEX telescope in Chile, located nearly 5,000 miles away from
  each other. “The baselines to SPT give us two to three times more
  resolution than our past arrays, which is absolutely crucial to
  the goals of the EHT. To verify the existence of an event
  horizon, the ‘edge’ of a black hole, and more generally to test
  Einstein’s theory of general relativity, we need a very detailed
  picture of a black hole. With the full EHT, we should be able to
  do this,”Dan Marrone, an assistant professor in the
  University of Arizona’s Department of Astronomy and Steward
  Observatory, said.  This week, the 75 feet (23 meter) high South Pole Telescope was
  connected to the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment, the Large
  Millimeter Telescope in Mexico, the Submillimeter Telescope in
  Arizona, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
  Astronomy in California, the Submillimeter Array and James Clerk
  Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii, and the Institute for Radio
  Astronomy Millimetrique (IRAM) telescopes in Spain and France.“Now that we’ve done VLBI [Very Long Baseline Interferometry]
  with the SPT, the Event Horizon Telescope really does span the
  whole earth, from the Submillimeter Telescope on Mount Graham in
  Arizona, to California, Hawaii, Chile, Mexico and the South
  Pole,”he added.Black holes were theoretically postulated by Albert Einstein’s
  General Theory of Relativity, later to be proved by decades of
  astronomical observations. Our galaxy, Milky Way is home not only
  to the supermassive black hole at its core, but also to 25
  smaller ones. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/251801-black-hole-earth-telescope/

"6 Mar, 2015 09:20","Exploding star observed 4 times over, thanks to unique gravitational lensing","The Hubble telescope captured a star’s explosion four times over. In a nod to Einstein, it used the natural lensing effect created by the gravitational pull of galaxies to probe the edges of the observable universe, where no normal telescope can reach. This marks the first time ever a distant star explosion has been
  observed four times over. ""It's a wonderful discovery,""Alex Filippenko, professor
  of astronomy at UC Berkeley in California says.“We’ve been
  searching for a strongly lensed supernova for 50 years… Besides
  being really cool, it should provide a lot of astrophysically
  important information,”Berkeley cites the astronomer as
  saying. ""The four supernova images captured by Hubble appeared within a
  few days or weeks of each other and we found them after they had
  appeared,"" Steve Rodney of Johns Hopkins University, USA, leader
  of the Frontier Fields Supernova team, said in another press
  release. Their findings werepublishedin the journal Science. The supernova, at 9.3 billion light years away, was captured
  thanks to a cluster of galaxies that sits just between us and the
  explosion. Together with a massive galaxy at the center, they
  bend and magnified the light in between. READ MORE:Mars once had an ocean with more water than the Arctic –
  NASA The object was christened by scientists as SN Refsdal, after Sjur
  Refsdal, the Norwegian who pioneered gravitational lensing
  studies.  In 2009, they observed that the cluster, 5 billion light years
  away, gave off incredibly clear images of a spiral galaxy, so
  took note. The current image of the supernova is created by the
  ‘red galaxy’ at the center. Because it is inside the cluster, its
  effects are combined with those of the surrounding lenses, so
  there’s“a double lensing effect,”according to Patrick
  Kelly of Berkeley, who first observed the supernova on November
  10, while studying Hubble photos of the area. According to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, great
  concentrations of mass can bend light as though it were a lens.
  This magnifies distant objects as though they were hundreds of
  times closer. The first such lens was discovered in 1979. ""These gravitational lenses are like a natural magnifying
  glass. It's like having a much bigger telescope,""Kelly
  explains.""We can get magnifications of up to 100 times by
  looking through these galaxy clusters,""he added. ""It was predicted 50 years ago that a supernova could be
  gravitationally lensed like this, but it's taken a long time for
  someone to find an example,""he also told Space.com. But what allowed the Australian and American scientists on the
  project to make the photograph four times over? The images each appeared separately over several weeks because
  during lensing, light bends and takes various paths and different
  times to reach those paths. Gravity warps the fabric of reality.
  The greater the mass of the object, the more lensing will occur,
  because of its greater effect on gravity. Light is then also bent
  like a lens. READ MORE:Dark matter space superstructures observed for first
  time The difference is in the strength of the lens. When the object is
  far from the gravitationally lensing mass, or if its area is not
  especially large, ‘weak lensing’ takes place. But when these
  conditions are reversed, the light from the object comes from
  almost directly behind the source of that gravitational lens.
  This leads to ‘strong lensing’ and explains why the image was
  captured four times. When a lens is close to a large object, its image can get smeared
  into a so-called ‘Einstein ring’ when observed through the lens.
  However, what we have in this case is an ‘Einstein cross’ – when
  distant objects that appear smaller are combined with strong
  lensing. With the super-bright quasars, it’s practically the same
  thing as looking at a lit match through a piece of crystal.
  Multiple images are produced that surround the gravitational
  lensing mass. The sky is filled with these lenses. The trouble is finding and
  using them to our advantage. READ MORE:Eyes in the skies: Mysterious bright spots on Ceres
  dwarf planet look like glowing eyes  According to Filippenko, the bonus here is that astronomers can
  set their clocks to observe supernova replays. One will occur
  within the next decade. A computer model of the observed cluster
  shows that scientists missed one opportunity 50 years ago,
  another, 10 years ago. Opportunity will knock again, but will
  depend on how the gravitational pull of the galaxy cluster
  behaves. Scientists need to capture precise moments when
  everything is aligned for best results. But they would not be spending millions of dollars on useless
  research, so the point here is what this quadruple image of the
  SN Refsdal can tell us. We can measure the arrival of good lensing opportunities and, as
  a result, map how ordinary, visible matter and dark matter
  interact within the confines of the galaxy cluster. This will
  provide invaluable insights, according to Kelly and Filippenko. READ MORE:Dark energy devouring dark matter to leave 'big empty

"27 Feb, 2015 11:12",Social media deception: Venezuela exposes “La Salida” conspiracy,"From February to June 2014, Venezuela experienced a period of violence and terrorism by individuals whose stated goal was to force “La Salida,” (the Exit) of the elected government. One year later, the
  Venezuelan government has documented the involvement of foreign
  powers in a campaign of media disinformation that accompanied the
  unrest on the streets. On February 12, 2015, the Venezuelan Consulate in New York City
  commemorated the 43 people (33 civilians plus 10 police and
  military personnel) who perished during the events that took
  place last year. The presentation documented that the episode of
  violence and unrest was not a spontaneous, grassroots uprising.
  Instead it was the result of collaboration between nonprofit
  agencies in the United States and an extremely isolated fringe
  section of the Venezuelan right wing. The goal of this
  collaboration was to destabilize and overthrow the elected
  government. Twenty-nine of the people who died during""La Salida""perished as a result of gunshot wounds, seven from traps set on
  roads. The violence that ultimately took 43 lives, included
  motorcyclists being virtually beheaded when they ran into steel
  wires placed across intersections by opposition groups. Bombings
  targeted hospitals, universities and buses. Explosions took place
  dangerously close to children’s daycare centers. Many people were
  in fear of their lives.  Presenting before the audience gathered at the Venezuelan
  Consulate, Dr. George Ciccariello-Maher of Drexel University
  said,“These are events that, even as they were occurring,
  were misrepresented.”He described the episode of violence
  as a staged plot to bring the Venezuelan government down – a plot
  that involved media manipulation and a large amount of foreign
  backing. The movement that eventually created the Bolivarian Republic of
  Venezuela can trace its roots to an upsurge in 1989 known as the“Caracazo.”This was an explosion of anger against
  neoliberal privatizations and the rising cost of public
  transportation. A rising amount of protests, strikes, and
  anti-Western sentiment eventually resulted in the 1999 election
  of Hugo Chavez as president and the 2002 beating back of a coup
  attempt against him. Chavez, who took office on a platform of opposing neoliberalism
  and economic domination by the United States, launched a series
  of economic reforms. After ratifying a new constitution, the
  country declared itself to be a“Bolivarian Republic”in
  honor of patriotic Latin American anti-colonial leader Simon
  Bolivar. The new government opened facilities, staffed with Cuban
  doctors, which provided free healthcare to low-income
  Venezuelans. This implementation of accessible medicine was
  followed by massive literacy programs. Starting with the most impoverished, the Venezuelan government
  has used the proceeds from the state-owned oil company for the
  benefit of the population. New universities have been
  established. Labor unions and community organizations have been
  empowered. Telecommunications, cement, and steel have been
  nationalized. Food prices have been regulated to ensure the
  population has adequate nutrition. Land has been redistributed in
  the countryside, and hundreds of thousands of homes for
  low-income families have been constructed in a“Grand Housing
  Mission.” The result of these reforms has been good for the majority of the
  population.Povertyhas dropped by 40 percent. Infant
  mortality hasdecreasedby 10 percent. Before his death, Hugo Chavez declared his aim was the creation
  of“21st Century Socialism”in Venezuela -- the ultimate
  goal of what he called the“Bolivarian Process.”In
  elections, the Venezuelan public has voted for Chavez, as well as
  his successor Nicolas Maduro, in solid majorities. Election
  monitors from the United Nations, the Carter Center, and the
  Organization of American States have all confirmed that the
  massive popular votes in favor of the Bolivarian Process are
  legitimate.  However, there has been a minority of right-wing Venezuelans who
  refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Maduro’s presidency, and
  are doing all they can to destabilize the government. In his
  presentation, Ciccariello-Maher described them as“delusionally paranoid”in thinking that “the Carter
  Center and everyone else” were all part of a“conspiracy”when confirming the accuracy of the
  election results. Articlesand reports in international media
  continue to portray the Venezuelan elections as fraudulent,
  despite the words of the United Nations, the Carter Center, and
  the Organization of American States. When Maduro was elected in the aftermath of Chavez’s death, the
  right-wing opposition had been once again defeated at the polls.
  Mainstream opposition leaders like Henrique Capriles called for
  the Venezuelan right wing to re-examine its strategies – to
  perhaps adopt support for certain economic aspects of the
  Bolivarian process. The hard-line section of the Venezuelan
  opposition, based primarily on the college campuses and in
  wealthy neighborhoods, had different ideas. On February 12, 2014, the opposition started a campaign of
  violence on “Youth Day” – a traditional commemoration of an 1814
  battle during Venezuela’s war of independence. Ciccariello-Maher
  stated that the timing of the campaign was very intentional. “The
  goal was to seamlessly insert themselves into this historical
  trajectory, this moment of upsurge and resistance against
  authoritarianism, for democracy, for equality. To do so, they had
  to misrepresent what they were doing on the ground.” The
  protesters attempted to present themselves as a Venezuelan
  version of the Occupy Wall Street movement or Spain’s Los
  Indignados. The campaign had little support domestically -- but winning
  domestic support was not the goal of this campaign.
  Ciccariello-Maher, who directly observed the actions of
  theatrical violence and chaos in Venezuela’s streets, said: “It
  was made for Twitter. It was made for Facebook. It was made for
  the English-speaking international media.” The Albert Einstein Institute, along with many “human
  rights”-oriented nonprofit agencies and non-governmental
  organizations based in the United States, poured money into and
  gave wide publicity to the protests. Claims that “people were
  being shot dead on the streets left and right” circulated the
  internet, along with inflammatory claims that a “tropical pogrom”
  was taking place. This video of police shooting rubber bullets was linked from the
  blog""Caracas Chronicles""from the phrase""We have
  videos of soldiers shooting civilians on the street.""The
  post spoke of a""Tropical Pogrom."") The hope was that the media blitz could be used to justify
  foreign intervention. Ciccariello-Maher points out:“The
  hashtags were very revealing… SOS Venezuela. Who is the audience
  of such a hashtag? It’s some foreign savior somewhere else.” An appeal to all to show support for the people of Venezuela.
    Please read:http://t.co/v9LyAn8E4i#SOSVenezuelapic.twitter.com/uaaK2t9vxI — Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey)April
    5, 2014 Videos were published purporting to show the Venezuelan police
  firing live ammunition into crowds. In reality, the police were
  only firing rubber bullets in the hope of pushing back an
  increasingly violent crowd of oppositionists. Giving a romantic image to the anti-Maduro street fighters, a
  photograph showing two youths wearing Guy Fawkes masks, in front
  of a wall spray-painted with the words“Maduro is coming for
  you,”circulated the internet. Ciccariello-Maher pointed out
  that the image was very deceptive:“That picture was taken in
  the center of the richest part of Caracas,” he said. Speaking of
  the protesters, mostly wealthy students, he remarked that “they
  did not get out of the rich areas, because they knew they did not
  have support in the barrios.” Postslike this on the Huffington Post presented photos
  painting a romantic portrait of the Anti-Bolivarian protesters
  wearing Guy Fawkes masks. The post fails to mention that the
  photos were exclusively taken in the wealthiest neighborhoods of
  Caracas.  Pointing to the danger of lies spread on social media,
  Ciccariello-Maher pointed out that“You can debunk it, but by
  the time you’ve debunked it, a dozen more lies have been
  spread.” The violent campaign of“La Salida”was defeated because
  it did not have support among the population. “It may have been effective internationally, but it was not
  effective where it counted: domestically,”Ciccariello-Maher
  remarked. He went on to describe how the deceptive social media
  campaign had weakened the international response in defense of
  Venezuela. “People in the United States, people on the left -- we
  failed.”He said.“We fell for the allure of the
  protester in the streets.” Since the end of the“La Salida”campaign, Robert Serra,
  a leader of the Bolivarian Movement who had been elected to the
  National Assembly, was stabbed to death in his home. Video
  recorded confessions link the assassins to the US-backed
  government in neighboring Colombia. A recent plot within the
  Venezuelan military to depose Maduro has also been exposed. US government officials continue to refer to both Maduro and his
  predecessor Hugo Chavez as“brutal dictators.”Based on
  claims of repression, new sanctions have been placed on Venezuela
  by the United States.  No matter how many times the Bolivarian government has been
  democratically re-elected, how much the hostile private
  Venezuelan media is tolerated, or how mildly the extremist
  opposition is treated, these claims persist. Because the Maduro
  government continues opposing neoliberalism and the domination of
  Wall Street banks, western politicians and media pundits continue
  to insist that it cannot be legitimate. The presentation at the Venezuelan Consulate warned that the
  opposition is likely to again utilize the tactic of creating a
  staged, unpopular“revolt”as a pretext for foreign
  intervention. Ciccariello-Maher remarked,“Methods that were
  historically associated with the left and with struggles against
  dictatorship are being taken over by the right.” Indeed, the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government by
  forces aligned with the United States was accompanied by a
  similar media blitz, filled with deceptive images and videos. A
  similar social media campaign has presented the US-backed
  anti-government insurgents in Syria as romantic heroes,
  downplaying their extremism, slaughter of civilians, and use of
  child soldiers. Venezuela is currently mourning for the 43 people who died during
  the“La Salida”events. As part of the grieving process,
  Venezuelan officials are urging the global community to expect
  similar events, and be prepared to look beyond mainstream Western
  media for information. They intend to continue down the path of
  popular reforms in the Bolivarian process, and expect that there
  will be many more efforts to beat them back. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Hubble telescope captures extraterrestrial smiley face,"The heavens are smiling back at mankind through a star constellation discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, which captured an image of a galaxy cluster that looks exactly like the smiley face we have all grown accustomed to in the internet age. The galactic smiley can
  be seen in the photo of galaxy cluster SDSS J1038+4849. The
  picture was recently released by NASA after the cluster was
  spotted by amateur star gazer Judy Schmidt. Its two bright glowing eyes are in fact separate galaxies, while
  the face and smile itself are distinct due to the celestial
  effect known as“strong gravitational lensing.” “Galaxy clusters are the most massive structures in the
  Universe and exert such a powerful gravitational pull that they
  warp the spacetime around them and act as cosmic lenses which can
  magnify, distort and bend the light behind them,”the Hubble
  website explains, citing Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Hubble spots a galaxy smiling at ushttp://t.co/Gdo8XweHDoCredit:@NASA&@ESAAcknowledgement: Judy

  Einstein and include data about traffic to government websites,

    25, 2014 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the reason for
  purging the records is that there is ""quickly diminishing

  detection, prevention and analysis."" Records considered of “no value” are emails of federal
  workers and public citizens communicating about potential cyber
  threats to DHS, “suspicious files, spam and other potential

  activity, and a repository for threat sightings and indicators.  The destruction of records is typically made because of the costs
  of storing information indefinitely, but security experts say
  commercial storage costs are $50 a month per terbyte of data in
  the cloud. The National Archives and Records Administration has
  tentatively approved the purging plan pending a public comment
  period. Security experts argue the problem with destroying records is it

"7 Nov, 2014 08:29",Chomsky: NATO is a U.S.-run intervention force," How did Russia and the West slip back into what seems like the Cold War all over again? How dangerous is the current confrontation? Should the world be ready to face a nuclear war? We ask somebody who’s renowned for his insights. World-famous academic, linguist, philosopher and political commentator Noam Chomsky is on Sophie&Co today.  Follow@SophieCo_RT  Sophie Shevardnadze:World-renowned academic Noam Chomsky, Professor Noam Chomsky, welcome to the show, it’s a great pleasure to have you with us today. Now, today U.S.-Russia relations are at a Cold War low. Rhetoric resembles what we heard in the 80-s. What is the worst-case scenario we could see this turn into? Can the Cold War turn hot? Does U.S. want war? Noam Chomsky: The worst-case scenario, of course, would be a nuclear war, which would be terrible. Both states that initiate it will be wiped out by the consequences. That’s the worst-case. And it’s come ominously close several times in the past, dramatically close. And it could happen again, but not planned, but just by the accidental interactions that take place - that has almost happened. It’s worth remembering that just one century ago, the First World War broke out through a series of such accidental interchanges. The First World War was horrifying enough, but the current reenactment of it means the end of the human race. SS:President Obama came to power promising to work towards complete global nuclear disarmament. Well, now there are plans to spend one trillion dollars on nuclear arms in the next 30 years.With major powers only acquiring more nukes, it’s only obvious that others will want to as well, so could we see the nuclear non-proliferation regime crumble in the near future?NC: We can think back as far as 1955, when Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein produced an appeal, a joint appeal to the people of the world, in which they said to all of us, you have a choice that is stark, unavoidable, the question is, will you eliminate war or will you eliminate human race? These are your choices. And we’ve come awfully close, several times since: the missile crisis in 1962 was described by Kennedy’s close associate, historian Arthur Schlesinger, as “the most dangerous moment in human history”, and he was quite right, we came very close to a nuclear war. There have been many cases, not that serious, but pretty close, where human intervention with a few-minutes choice has prevented a nuclear war. You can’t guarantee that’s going to continue. It may not be a high probability each time, but when you play a game like that, with low probability risks of disaster over and over again, you’re going to lose. And now, especially in the crisis over Ukraine, and so-called missile-defense systems near the borders of Russia, it’s a threatening situation.SS:Professor, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said the U.S. needs to deal with “Russia’s army on NATO’s doorstep”. But as you yourself put it: “America’s redlines are firmly placed at Russia’s borders”. What are American redlines doing on Russian borders?NC: Well, this statement was interesting. Of course, it’s correct. But NATO’s borders have been expanded to reach Russia’s borders. This takes us back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, there was an agreement between Gorbachev and President Bush, Bush number one, that NATO would not expand one inch to the east. That meant to East Germany, that was the agreement. As soon as the agreement was made, NATO was expanded to East Germany, Gorbachev was naturally infuriated, but he was informed by President Bush and his Secretary of State, James Baker, that this was only a verbal agreement, there was nothing on paper, which is true, there was nothing on paper. And Gorbachev had no choice, but to accept it. President Clinton came along, the next president, and in a couple of years they expanded NATO even further. In fact, one might ask why NATO even continued to exist. The official justification for NATO was that its purpose was to defend Western Europe from Russian hordes who might attack Western Europe. Can’t ask how plausible that explanation was, but that at least that was the official explanation. Well, 1990-1991 - no Russian hordes. Natural conclusion - ok, let’s disband NATO. The opposite happens – NATO expanded. Its mission changed. The official mission of NATO became to control the international, the global energy system, pipelines. That means, to control the world. Of course, its U.S.-run intervention force, as in Kosovo and Serbia in 1999 – it was a U.S.-run intervention force. That’s the new NATO and it did expand to Russian borders, so Hagel is correct, Russia is on NATO’s borders, but it’s as if the Warsaw Pact had expanded to Mexico and Canada, and then the Russian premier said, well, the United States is on the Warsaw Pact’s borders, which would have been true, but it would be misleading.SS:You know, watching and reading the U.S. media, it’s hard not to be surprised at the calls for war in one form or another. I mean, there are wordings like “red lines”, “no options off the table”, “lethal aid”, “troops on the ground”, and all this is presented like it’s no big deal. And not only in press, but by the government officials as well. Now, you are a scientist of words, of mind, you are a political activist, what do you make of it? Why are the Americans apparently so ready to go to war?NC: Well, I don’t think they are ready to go to war, but the commitment to sort of control the world is very strong. And pretty natural. After all, this is one global super-power. And this all goes a way back. So, the peak of American power in history was around 1945. In 1945 the United States literally had half the world’s wealth. And very naturally American leaders wanted to design and organize a world system, which would benefit primarily domestic centers of power that essentially means U.S. corporate system. The origins of multi-national corporations began to develop at that time... And there were detailed plans for assigning to every part of the world, what was called, a function within the global system. That began to collapse very quickly. There is a lot of talk these days about American decline, which is correct, but it’s rarely recognized that the decline began at once. In 1949 there was a serious blow to the U.S. global hegemony – China’s independence. There’s a name for that in U.S. history and Western history. It is called “the loss of China”. Just think about this phrase for a minute. “Loss of China”. I mean, I can lose my computer, I can’t lose your computer, right? I can only lose what I own. And the assumption, the tacit assumption is – we own China, we own the world.So, if any part of it becomes independent, there’s the loss of China, or the loss of Indo-China, the loss of the Middle East, and so on. However it is worth recognizing, going back to your comment, that there is criticism of this in very prestigious places. So, the leading establishing journal in the United States is “Foreign Affairs”, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations, that’s as central to the ruling establishment as you can get. In their last issue, the lead article advertised on the front page, was an article by a well-known international relations specialist, John Mearsheimer, with the headline, something like “The West is Responsible for the Crisis in Ukraine”. And it’s a critic of U.S. and Western policy that has driven things to the point where there is a serious crisis in Ukraine, the crisis that, as Mearsheimer points out, has serious effects on Russian geostrategic concerns and would do so, no matter who was in charge in Russia, just because of the geostrategic nature of the circumstances. That’s right in the main establishing journal, the lead article so it’s not like this is going on without critical discussion. There’s some. Not enough I think. But some.SS:Russia’s President Vladimir Putin says the West can’t isolate Russia through confrontation and sanctions. What do you think, is he right?NC: It can’t isolate Russia, but it could cause serious harm to Russia, but what it’s likely to do and is beginning to do - I’m not the only one to point this out, it’s obvious - what it’s doing, it’s driving Russia towards the East, towards closer relations with China. There’s plenty of hostility way back between China and Russia, but there are also some common interests, and the sanctions and other pressure against Russia are almost compelling Russia to move towards closer relations with China. China is the center of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a very substantial international system based on China, which includes India, includes Russia, includes Pakistan, includes the Central Asian States - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and others – it’s a big international system. Current Western policies are driving Russia towards closer interaction with this Chinese-based system. In this interaction Russia is actually the weaker partner, so it’s making concessions, but the U.S. is openly creating a system of power, which could significantly diminish U.S. domination in the world. This a confrontation, it’s part of Obama’s pivot to Asia.There is a Trans-Pacific Partnership, so-called, a huge commercial treaty, designed to incorporate the Asian countries, not China, but the other Asian countries, crucially not China, including Japan, Australia, India, the southern hemisphere, Chile, Brazil and so on. An enormous trade pact, exactly, what it is we don’t know, it is kept secret. These things are negotiated in secret, then given to the Parliaments to sign - yes or no, meaning yes. No discussion, no choices. So it’s not a sure thing by any means. But that’s the plan and it’s the kind of economic counterpart to the military pivot to Asia, and the sanctions on Russia are helping to create a counter-course based on Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or an extension of it, which would include Russia, and may begin to move across Eurasia, the whole Eurasian region, first to Turkey, then to parts of Western Europe, which have their own close relations with Russia and the East, Germany in particular. Those are the things that are developing recently, and the sanctions are part of it.SS:Professor, I want to talk about crisis around ISIS a little bit. You’ve said that the appearance of ISIS and the spread of extremism is a natural consequence of U.S. actions in Iraq. But the emergence of ISIS seemed a surprise to all, how did U.S. intelligence miss it?NC: I suggest that you look up on the Internet a recent article by Graham Fuller. He is a very highly regarded commentator on Middle Eastern affairs, coming straight out of the U.S. establishment with a long background in the CIA, a highly respected, very knowledgeable commentator. What he says is and I’m quoting him: “The United States created ISIS”. And then he goes on to say: “The U.S. didn’t plan ISIS of course”. These conspiracy tales have no basis. But the U.S. actions in region, including the invasion, have created the circumstances, under which ISIS emerged, and I think he is correct. What happened is the U.S. basically hit Iraq with a kind of sledgehammer. U.S. forces instantly instituted a governmental structure, which was sectarian in nature, they designed a system with particular participation by Shiites and Sunnis in various proportions, but they had to be divided that way. That, along with the counter-insurgency operations - there was of course resistance to the invasion - counter-insurgency operations are always very brutal and destructive. All of this came together to create sectarian conflicts, which had not existed before. If you look back at Bagdad in 2000, Shiites and Sunnis were intermarried, living in the same areas, they often didn’t even know who’s a Sunni and who’s Shia, it’s kind of like knowing which Protestant sect your neighbor belongs to, you may not know and you may not care. If you look at Bagdad ten years later, five years later, it’s broken up into separate regions, walled off from one another, brutal military conflicts, much of the population expelled. That has since expanded, and now it’s tearing the whole region apart. Syria is one element of it. Iran-Saudi confrontation is another aspect. And out of this emerged ISIS. Graham Fuller is quite correct.SS:You just quoted a man that you respect a lot, who said, it’s the United States who involuntarily actually created ISIS, so if it’s the United States actions that brought about ISIS, isn’t it only fair that the United States should lead the fight against it today? I mean, it’s only obvious that political and diplomatic means to solve this mess aren’t there. So, do you support the U.S.-led bombing campaign?NC: There are ways to respond diplomatically, one conceivable possibility, conceivable, is to act in accordance with the law. There is a reign of international law, that’s in principal. It debars the use of force or the threat of force in international affairs, except under authorization by the UN Security Council. A law-abiding state would go to the Security Council, ask for a declaration by the Security Council of a threat to peace, and request the Security Council to organize direct response to it. And that could be done. The U.S. could then participate in it, but so could Iran. Remember, look at the Iraqi Foreign Office, what they want is for Iran to become involved. It’s a major military force. If it did enter it would probably wipe out ISIS in no time. But the U.S. won’t permit that. The U.S.-run coalition, which is in violation of basic international law, excludes Iran, excludes the PKK and its affiliates, which apparently are doing the ground-fighting - according to the U.S., they are terrorist group. Turkey, which is closest U.S. ally, is opposed to them. The central U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia - that’s been the source of funding, the main source of the funding of ISIS, but also it’s the ideological source. It’s the Wahabi-Salafi extremists, that’s radical Islamic doctrines, which are kind of a fringe of Islam in Saudi Arabia, a fringe of that radical doctrine is ISIS. So, this coalition is kind of a meaningless coalition, apart from being illegal. There would be ways of handling, at least approaching the problem legally, which could work.SS:And just my final question, on a different topic. The FBI is now looking into an apparent second Edward Snowden, but previous whistleblower revelations have failed to make any real dent in the system. Why would this be any different? Talking about NSA spying isn’t stopping NSA spying.NC: It’s not stopping NSA spying, it’s not stopping the spying being done by Britain, the spying being done by France, the spying being done by other countries, I’m sure Russia’s doing it. States are very resistant to interference with their powers. Of course, the NSA system, U.S. is far and away the technologically most advanced country in the world, so it’s more extensive in the United States, but it’s duplicated in China, Britain, Russia, no doubt, other countries. And, yes, you’re right, it hasn’t stopped, now in fact it’s expanding. It’s a real major attack on human rights. And the major threat is if it becomes sort of passively accepted, because of the fact that it’s not stopped, this is just going to go on, go on to the point where there are literally tiny drones, fly-size drones, that can be on the ceiling of your living room, listening to what you’re saying and sending it back to the central government office. There are no limits to this. Already, if you have a cellphone, even if it’s off, you can be tracked by NSA and other technologies. So this is a really dangerous development. Snowden made a major contribution by exposing it, but there’s a long way to go. There has to be a citizen reaction, which would put an end to this practice.SS:Professor Chomsky, thank you so much for this interview. We were talking to world-renowned academic, American linguist, thinker, activist Noam Chomsky.We were talking about what’s in store for Russia-U.S. relations, also the crisis around ISIS, and if the next whistleblower scandal is going to be any different from the one around Edward Snowden. Thanks a lot for this interview. That’s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time.  NC: We can think back as far as 1955, when Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein produced an appeal, a joint appeal to the people of the world, in which they said to all of us, you have a choice that is stark, unavoidable, the question is, will you eliminate war or will you eliminate human race?

It may not be a high probability each time, but when you play a game like that, with low probability risks of disaster over and over again, you’re going to lose. And now, especially in the crisis over Ukraine, and so-called missile-defense systems near the borders of Russia, it’s a threatening situation.

Those are the things that are developing recently, and the sanctions are part of it. SS:Professor, I want to talk about crisis around ISIS a little bit. You’ve said that the appearance of ISIS and the spread of extremism is a natural consequence of U.S. actions in Iraq. But the emergence of ISIS seemed a surprise to all, how did U.S. intelligence miss it? NC: I suggest that you look up on the Internet a recent article by Graham Fuller. He is a very highly regarded commentator on Middle Eastern affairs, coming straight out of the U.S. establishment with a long background in the CIA, a highly respected, very knowledgeable commentator. What he says is and I’m quoting him: “The United States created ISIS”. And then he goes on to say: “The U.S. didn’t plan ISIS of course”. These conspiracy tales have no basis. But the U.S. actions in region, including the invasion, have created the circumstances, under which ISIS emerged, and I think he is correct. What happened is the U.S. basically hit Iraq with a kind of sledgehammer. U.S. forces instantly instituted a governmental structure, which was sectarian in nature, they designed a system with particular participation by Shiites and Sunnis in various proportions, but they had to be divided that way. That, along with the counter-insurgency operations - there was of course resistance to the invasion - counter-insurgency operations are always very brutal and destructive. All of this came together to create sectarian conflicts, which had not existed before. If you look back at Bagdad in 2000, Shiites and Sunnis were intermarried, living in the same areas, they often didn’t even know who’s a Sunni and who’s Shia, it’s kind of like knowing which Protestant sect your neighbor belongs to, you may not know and you may not care. If you look at Bagdad ten years later, five years later, it’s broken up into separate regions, walled off from one another, brutal military conflicts, much of the population expelled. That has since expanded, and now it’s tearing the whole region apart. Syria is one element of it. Iran-Saudi confrontation is another aspect. And out of this emerged ISIS. Graham Fuller is quite correct. SS:You just quoted a man that you respect a lot, who said, it’s the United States who involuntarily actually created ISIS, so if it’s the United States actions that brought about ISIS, isn’t it only fair that the United States should lead the fight against it today? I mean, it’s only obvious that political and diplomatic means to solve this mess aren’t there. So, do you support the U.S.-led bombing campaign? NC: There are ways to respond diplomatically, one conceivable possibility, conceivable, is to act in accordance with the law. There is a reign of international law, that’s in principal. It debars the use of force or the threat of force in international affairs, except under authorization by the UN Security Council. A law-abiding state would go to the Security Council, ask for a declaration by the Security Council of a threat to peace, and request the Security Council to organize direct response to it. And that could be done. The U.S. could then participate in it, but so could Iran. Remember, look at the Iraqi Foreign Office, what they want is for Iran to become involved. It’s a major military force. If it did enter it would probably wipe out ISIS in no time. But the U.S. won’t permit that. The U.S.-run coalition, which is in violation of basic international law, excludes Iran, excludes the PKK and its affiliates, which apparently are doing the ground-fighting - according to the U.S., they are terrorist group. Turkey, which is closest U.S. ally, is opposed to them. The central U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia - that’s been the source of funding, the main source of the funding of ISIS, but also it’s the ideological source. It’s the Wahabi-Salafi extremists, that’s radical Islamic doctrines, which are kind of a fringe of Islam in Saudi Arabia, a fringe of that radical doctrine is ISIS. So, this coalition is kind of a meaningless coalition, apart from being illegal. There would be ways of handling, at least approaching the problem legally, which could work. SS:And just my final question, on a different topic. The FBI is now looking into an apparent second Edward Snowden, but previous whistleblower revelations have failed to make any real dent in the system. Why would this be any different? Talking about NSA spying isn’t stopping NSA spying. NC: It’s not stopping NSA spying, it’s not stopping the spying being done by Britain, the spying being done by France, the spying being done by other countries, I’m sure Russia’s doing it. States are very resistant to interference with their powers. Of course, the NSA system, U.S. is far and away the technologically most advanced country in the world, so it’s more extensive in the United States, but it’s duplicated in China, Britain, Russia, no doubt, other countries. And, yes, you’re right, it hasn’t stopped, now in fact it’s expanding. It’s a real major attack on human rights. And the major threat is if it becomes sort of passively accepted, because of the fact that it’s not stopped, this is just going to go on, go on to the point where there are literally tiny drones, fly-size drones, that can be on the ceiling of your living room, listening to what you’re saying and sending it back to the central government office. There are no limits to this. Already, if you have a cellphone, even if it’s off, you can be tracked by NSA and other technologies. So this is a really dangerous development. Snowden made a major contribution by exposing it, but there’s a long way to go. There has to be a citizen reaction, which would put an end to this practice. SS:Professor Chomsky, thank you so much for this interview. We were talking to world-renowned academic, American linguist, thinker, activist Noam Chomsky.We were talking about what’s in store for Russia-U.S. relations, also the crisis around ISIS, and if the next whistleblower scandal is going to be any different from the one around Edward Snowden. Thanks a lot for this interview. That’s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"25 Oct, 2014 09:32",On Putin's Valdai speech: The logjam in world diplomacy,"President Putin expressed frustration at the global status quo from the Valdai Conference. Western politicians may find it painful to appreciate that the Russian president was accurate in many assessments.     Former French PM Dominique de Villepin expressed a‘mot juste’: the spiral of mistrust needs to be reversed. The trouble is once I introduce the name of the next speaker at the Valdai conference, a significant chunk of the trolling classes will immediately head for the comments section to resume the war of words, doubtless suggesting the Russian political class advocates eating babies or some other ludicrous notion. Mentioning‘Vladimir Putin’and ‘constructive comment’ in the same sentence is more than stubbornly closed-minded elements of the Western media can comprehend. A dismal Cold War spirit has been re-engaged from various points west despite a very post-Communist spirit being apparent within seconds of landing on Russian soil. We have a logjam in world diplomacy. The single superpower of the past 20 years is demonstrating monopolistic follies tinged with delusion, ringed with incompetence. Thus US intelligence agencies missed the rise of ISIS until they reached the cusp of conquering an area somewhere between the size of Belgium and South Korea… For those worried about big government inefficiency, it is difficult to endorse American intelligence agencies as delivering value for taxpayers. Thus Putin expounded a rather telling argument: the American-centric superpower era has created troubling consequences - and a remarkable power vacuum! Militant terrorists rampaging in Canada clearly implies total failure to make the world a safer place. American‘divine right’regime change has destabilized the world with the US falling into imperial folly, unable to acknowledge its mistakes, destined to evoke Einstein’s definition of""Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" In Sochi this week, Putin didn’t mince his words. He is understandably frustrated about sanctions - a bizarre process by which Europe has sacrificed economic recovery to please the USA, whose Russian economic exposure is minimal. Meanwhile Russia may be suffering ruble decreases, but the economy is still growing. Pity the poor Ukrainians: promised an unrealistic leap to prosperity by has-been Western politicians on the Maidan. The Ukrainian economy stands to decline a staggering 9 percent this year, despite a dismally low base thanks to a generation of color revolutions concealing oligarchical kleptocracy.  Putin has a clear right to his‘told you so’remarks, even leaving aside the Syrian fiasco in which President Obama crossed a self-created thin red line from Commander...to Discredited-Ditherer-in-Chief. Meanwhile the Chief Putter of the Oval Office prefers playing golf to negotiating nuclear arms reduction which Russia is eager to pursue. President Putin succinctly described US sanctions as“sawing through the branches on which they are sitting”while he presses on with an Eastern pivot which the West dismisses at its peril. That US sole superpower status will be threatened outright by China soon. True, the US has played its fiercest card, endeavoring to block Russia through the US dollar payment system, but that financial hegemony will only last as long as the dollar is the undisputed currency king. Obama has motivated Russia to disintermediate it. Those keen to disparage Putin emphasize his Soviet-era Communist background. Curiously, outgoing EU President Barroso, whose decade in office has left the EU palpably poorer, was also an ex-Communist...but they sweep that under Brussels’ totalitarian carpet! Prescriptive Western arrogance is being undermined by relative financial decline - the Germans won’t bail out their EU neighbors, only Russo-Chinese involvement can save Ukraine from the economic abyss. Western credibility has suffered from shrill assertions that the hand of the Kremlin is omnipresent in every problem. Even Der Spiegel magazine is now distancing itself from previous suggestions that the MH17 tragedy involved direct Russian military intervention. There is much reform still to be undertaken, but Russia has achieved great things in two decades of freedom. It becomes all global citizens to encourage that path to greater prosperity. Rather we have a tired American empire abusing legal systems and due process, or as Putin put it: ""The existing system of international relations, international laws, the system of checks and balances have been therefore declared useless, obsolete and ready to be torn down."" Dominique De Villepin is right: the spiral of distrust must be broken - the sooner the better for everybody. But will any of the Western political pygmies be brave enough to break the impasse?

"6 Oct, 2014 20:42",Homeland Security to scan federal computer networks without prior authorization,"After failing to identify the potentially disastrous Heartbleed bug, the United States Department of Homeland Security has successfully lobbied to have the ability to conduct “regular and proactive scans” of civilian agency systems. Beth Cobert, the deputy director for management at the White
  House Office of Management and Budget,wroteon Friday that “growing cybersecurity
  threats,” including this year’s Heartbleed bug, have prompted the
  federal government to embrace better tactics aimed at ensuring
  the computer networks used by agencies stays secure. “In a rapidly changing technological environment, we must
  have robust procedures, policies and systems in place to protect
  our nation’s most sensitive information,”Cobert wrote in a
  blog post first published last week by the White House. To
  accomplish as much, her office has announced the establishment of
  a new process that subjects civilian agency networks to greater
  scrutiny. According to the official memorandum published last week by the
  White House OMB, the new mechanism being rolled out by DHS will
  see to it that the agency“Scan[s] internet accessible
  addresses and public facing segments of Federal civilian agency
  systems for vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis as well as in
  response to newly discovered vulnerabilities on an urgent basis,
  to include without prior agency authorization on an emergency
  basis where not prohibited by law.” By having the DHS “formalize” this process, the memo
  continues, critical cybersecurity areas of the federal government
  will be hopefully be better prepared in the event of a
  cyberattack or major network issue. “The Federal Government's response to the ‘Heartbleed’
  security vulnerability highlighted the need to formalize this
  process, and ensure that Federal agencies are proactively
  scanning networks for vulnerabilities,”the memo reads.“This year's guidance clarifies what is required of DHS and
  Federal agencies in this area.” But according toNextGovreporter Aliya Sternstein, the new
  process unveiled last week by DHS does more than just ensures
  networks stay safe — it also provides DHS with the unprecedented
  power to monitor these public-facing civilian agency networks. “DHS officials Friday toldNextgovthat, in the past, the
  department would have to obtain essentially permission slips from
  agencies before using Einstein and scanning their systems,”Sternstein wrote, referring to the diagnostic hardware and
  software suite currently used to detect and prevent cyberattacks.“Officials added that DHS now has 110 agreements from
  agencies to scan for vulnerabilities.” Cobert’s announcement of the new DHS initiative was made just one
  day after Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan), the chairman of the
  House Intelligence Committee, said the US lacks solid policies
  for both protecting its networks and launching cyber offensives. “As the [US government] writ large, we don’t have the
  policies down. We debate it a lot — I can’t tell you how much
  time we spent in the intelligence committee trying to figure out
  the way forward on what that looks like — and part of the
  challenge is the government has about 15 percent of the networks,
  and the private sector holds about 85 percent of the
  networks,”Rogers said.“And, contrary to popular belief,
  the NSA is not monitoring those networks. It is not on those
  networks. The only way that they see anything coming in is from
  the outside, so most of the offensive talk is from the private
  sector saying, ‘I’ve had enough and I’m going to do something
  about it.’ Because basically what we’ve done today by doing
  nothing in Congress is telling the 85 percent of these private
  networks, ‘You’re on your own. You have nation states who are
  targeting you; who are raving your networks. But you’re on your
  own. Good luck.’” Rogers has twice introduced bills in Congress that would let the
  government monitor activity on private sector networks, but
  privacy advocates have opposed the act citing the potential of
  unnecessary surveillance on those systems. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/193640-dhs-einstein-agency-scans/
"25 Sep, 2014 13:24",No black holes? Scientist claims mathematical proof,"An American physicist claims she has mathematically refuted the existence of black holes in our universe. The new theory combines Steve Hawking's radiation theory with quantum theory’s fundamental law that no information ever disappears from the universe. Professor Laura Mersini-Houghton from the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill maintains she managed tomergetwo seemingly contradicting theories, Einstein's theory of
  gravity and a fundamental law of quantum theory. While Einstein's theory predicts the formation of black holes,
  the quantum theory law says that no information from the universe
  can ever disappear, in an attempt to resolve the so-called
  ‘information law paradox.’ Until now modern science generally believed that a black hole
  forms from a massive star that collapses under its own gravity
  into a single spot in space the astronomers call a singularity,
  surrounded by the event horizon that neither light nor energy
  could escape from. Three decades ago renowned physicist Stephen
  Hawking proposed that black holes could emit radiation. Hawking’s
  hypothesis, made in 1974, was based on quantum mechanics. Mersini-Houghton agrees with Hawking on the radiation being given
  off by a collapsed star for a certain period of time, yet she
  also insists that by emitting radiation the star also loses too
  much of its mass right to the point when formation of a
  singularity – and a black hole – isimpossible. The academic suggests that the dying stars do not fall inward,
  but“probably blow up.” “Physicists have been trying to merge these two theories —
  Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics — for decades,
  but this scenario brings these two theories together, into
  harmony,”Mersini-Houghton said in the statement.“And
  that's a big deal.” According to the university, professor’s findings will make
  scientists“reimagine the fabric of space-time”and“rethink the origins of the universe.” “I'm still not over the shock,”said Mersini-Houghton, a
  professor in UNC’s College of Arts and Sciences.“We've been
  studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution
  gives us a lot to think about.” Mersini-Houghton’s conclusions have already been severely
  criticized by William Unruh, a theoretical physicist from the
  University of British Columbia. “The [paper] is nonsense,”Unruh said in an email to IFL
  Science media outlet. “Attempts like this to show that black holes never form have
  a very long history, and this is only the latest. They all
  misunderstand Hawking radiation, and assume that matter behaves
  in ways that are completely implausible,”he claimed. Quite to the contrary of Mersini-Houghton calculations, Unruh
  maintains that black holes do not emit enough Hawking radiation
  to lose mass to avoid formation of a black hole. “It would take 10^53 (1 followed by 53 zeros) times the age
  of the universe to evaporate,”Unruh explained, adding that
  it is a common mistake for those who do not understand Hawking’s
  radiation theory in full, that the“outgoing energy back
  closer and closer to the horizon of the black hole, where its
  energy density gets larger and larger,”he said. “Unfortunately, explicit calculations of the energy density
  near the horizon show it is really, really small instead of being
  large. Those calculations were already done in the 1970s. To call
  a bad speculation ‘has been proven mathematically’ is, shall we
  say, an overstatement,”Unruh concluded. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/190540-black-holes-are-nonexistent/
"25 Sep, 2014 08:22",Faith in reason,"Religion and politics have always been an explosive mix, perhaps never more so than in the case of ISIS. But is the brutality that we've seen a result of violent ideology or a reflection of the darker side of human nature? Oksana is joined by Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biologist and controversial author, to discuss these issues WATCH: https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/http://www.youtube.com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart.  Religion and politics have long been a dangerous mix, perhaps never more  so than in the case of the so-called Islamic State. Is this violence  and gloating evidence of everything that's wrong with religion, or  perhaps how religion can be used as a scapegoat for other, less than  honourable fields of human activity? Well, to discuss that, I'm now  joined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. Mr Dawkins, it's a  great honour to have you on the show. Richard Dawkins: Thank you very much. OB:Well, I know that you have been a critic of organised religion for quite some time, and you spoke about religion and evil. But I wonder if the pictures, the footage that we see coming out of Syria, of Iraq – you know, with the Islamic State executions, crucifixions, decapitations – if they leave you shocked? If somebody told you five years ago that we would be dealing with a phenomenon of such proportions, do you think you would be surprised? RD: Of course I would, I'm totally shocked. I think it's absolutely horrible. You're presumably raising the question, “Is religion responsible?” Religion itself is not responsible for this. These are savage people. You could ask whether religion is responsible for the support that they're getting. And there I think it probably is. I mean, they are getting support from people in Britain, people in Europe, and young men are going out to Syria and Iraq to join IS. And the motivation for that is in some sense religion. It's also this feeling of political involvement. It's a feeling that it's “us against them.” And I think that quite a large number of young Muslims feel kind of beleaguered against the rest of the world. And so religion in some sense might be just an excuse, but I do think that a dominant part of the motivation for these young men has to be religion. OB:Well, I would like to explore that a little bit later, but before we go there, if we could look at the biological aspect of it. And I think it, you are an evolutionary biologist, and probably you would agree that as species, we develop some adaptations to prevent us from excessive gore. I mean, killing itself is not easy. And you can argue that perhaps they're savage people and just a bunch of psychopaths, but there are a lot of them. Their number is too high to believe that there is something that is psychologically wrong with all of them. So, I wonder if this type of violence itself is not natural? Because, I mean, some people have, for example, a fainting reflex at the sight of blood. You know, it's difficult to kill people with your bare hands, and they do it very, very easily. RD: Well, a small number of them do. I mean, the ones who actually wield the knife are presumably psychopaths, and you probably could find them in any society. But perhaps you need to make a distinction between them and the people who support them. I am worried by the fact that so many people know about these awful decapitations and so on, and yet still join up. That, I think, you're perfectly right, that is a worrying thing. As for the biology of it, there's a tussle in evolutionary biology between a tendency to selfish violence and a tendency to altruistic cooperation. My book, The Selfish Gene, my first book, is sort of about that tussle. It's somehow, sometimes being misinterpreted as an advocacy of selfishness or a statement that we're all selfish. It's not that at all, of course. It's mostly about altruism. But there is a kind of tension between selfishness and altruism, both of which are favoured by natural selection, Darwinian natural selection, in different circumstances. OB:But I think you argue in your book that every activity has a purpose. I mean, even when people resort to violence, it has some practical value for them, for example the survival value, what have you. But what I think is very interesting about IS is they seem to be revelling in that killing. And that killing does not really serve any practical role, or perhaps it does, but I wonder if the case could be made that what they do is essentially against basic human instincts? Because, I mean, if you look at the footage, they're stepping over bodies lying in the street. And you can argue that just from the biological point of view, smelling decomposing flesh would be revolting, because we are afraid of catching infections, what have you. But they seem to be, it's almost like their basic instincts have gone numb. How would you explain that? RD: There is a perfectly good evolutionary theory of reciprocation, in which revenge plays a part. And so there can be an escalation of vengeance, which can go over many generations sometimes. And so you get vendettas in various societies, Mafia-influenced societies, various societies around the world. Killing, often of a hideous nature, is motivated by a vendetta, sometimes a family vendetta, tribal vendetta. There is a kind of pseudo-tribalism which uses religion as a label. And I suspect that some of these people think that this hideous violence is vengeance against, say, America, for attacking Iraq or for forming alliances with, I don't know, with Israel, say. And this vengeance becomes directed towards innocent people. There's one British man who is threatened with execution now, who is an aid worker, whose motivation is purely altruistic towards the people there. And yet he's been scapegoated as vengeance against the US and British governments. I think vengeance is a hideous emotion, but it is one that does have a biological basis. OB: I wonder if I can pick up on this political point, because clearly, as you just articulated, religion or any group of beliefs – they're also a reflection of everyday reality, what these people have been exposed to. And IS originated in Iraq, where violence has been raging for pretty much 10+ years. The coverage that we're getting, especially from Western media, of the IS, is that they're a bunch of psychopaths, barbarian sadists, and that may be true. But I wonder if politicians are perhaps exonerating themselves a little bit here? Because when you're exposed to extreme violence, not just on a daily basis but for years on end – is that really surprising that these people are willing to go to such great lengths to - RD: Yes, but if the causes of – I mean, are you saying something like the causes of the violence are the American invasion of Iraq, I mean that sort of thing? OB:Not so much the American invasion, but the type of violence that was brought by the war. You know, people exposed to very gory pictures on a daily basis. RD: Oh, ok, what do you mean [that] somehow people get desensitised because they're - OB:Absolutely, yeah, well that's the first thing that happens in a war zone. RD: Oh yes, I think that that does happen. And I think if you look back at, say, the First World War, Second World War, those things escalated and by the end of the war, people on both sides were prepared to do the most hideous things because they'd seen hideous things already done, yes. OB:Now, I consider myself an atheist, primarily thanks to you. But as a war reporter in the past, I've seen many examples, especially in war zones, when people experience so much grief or so much violence that religion becomes their only salvation. And it's not only on an intellectual level. I don't think they really think about the origins of the universe when they lose their loved ones. But they really need some sort of support at that time, and I don't think that critical thinking provides that, in those days. Do you think that religion still has a place in those societies, the most vulnerable societies? Not again as an intellectual concept, but as a social or emotional crutch? RD: Yes, I think very likely it does. I mean, I think it's perfectly possible to say there is no justification, scientific justification, for any truths that religious people claim. But on the other hand, they do provide consolation. And so, in the same way that a psychiatrist can console somebody by telling them something which may not be true, that I could imagine people do get consolation from religion. What sort of irritates me is when people do put it, what you're not doing, which is to confuse the possible role of religion with consoling people, with saying therefore it must be true. That's a total non-sequitur. OB: Now, I'm speaking here from perhaps my personal experience, but I found that to be an atheist, you have to invest a lot of time and effort into it, you have to do a lot of reading, you have to do a lot of thinking. And I think, for a lot of people around the world, that's a pure luxury. I mean, they cannot afford an intellectual lifestyle. They perhaps work several jobs, or again, live in war zones, when they would love to wonder about stars, but it's simply not part of their life. I wonder if the case could be made that atheism, at the end of the day, is a mark of social and intellectual distinction or status? That this is something that a lot of people around the world, stricken by poverty or stricken by war, simply cannot afford? RD: Yes, that's true, of course, of any intellectual pursuit. If you're starving, you better get on with trying to survive, and it's very, very difficult. So all intellectual pursuits, in a way, are a luxury which privileged people can afford to indulge in. The same is true of music, of philosophy, mathematics – all pursuits of the mind are things that we can do when we have the luxury, the leisure to do so. And many people, unfortunately, haven't got that luxury or leisure. OB:So would that essentially mean that your efforts to spread atheism around the world are essentially limited to the most fortunate part of it? RD: I would like to think not, because I think that a lot of the problems that the poorer people have may be brought upon them by religion. I don't deny that religion can be consoling to them, but what I'm suggesting is that they may be actually oppressed by religion. I think, for example, of the place of women in Islamic societies, where they are hideously oppressed by religious forces. OB:Well, I think we'll get a lot of response to just this phrase that you just uttered, because many would argue that in those societies, what looks like oppression to you is a set-up of life that makes it possible for a family unit or society to exist. Perhaps not perfect, but this is essentially a product of the circumstances. RD: Allow me to be sceptical. OB:Well, we talked about ISIS, and on the political level, we can see that it can, perhaps, bring sworn enemies together, like for example the United States and Iran. There are some negotiations about them working together. I wonder if the same could apply to religions, moderate religions, and atheists? Do you think that they could join forces, and if so in what way, in combating this very extreme form of (inaudible) - RD: Yes, that's a perennial argument again. I mean, it came up in the Second World War over enmities between Britain and the US, and Stalin's Russia. And they came together to fight Hitler, and then parted again after Hitler was defeated. In the case of atheists and religious people joining together, this comes up, in America especially, with the argument over Creationism and the teaching of evolution, where moderate religious people are on the same side as scientists in wanting evolution to be taught, and wanting young Earth Creationism not to be taught. And I have myself joined up, joined forces with bishops in Britain on this very issue. So yes, there are times when one seeks to make alliances with people that one doesn't always see eye to eye with. OB:But when you make those alliances, I wonder what kind of compromise, intellectual compromise, you're making with yourself? Because, you just decide that you're not going to look at their ideology, and not going to take it seriously? Because I mean, the story, for example, of Origin is a very important part of the doctrine. So even if you are joining forces with them, how - RD: We agree to differ on this, but we feel very strongly about that, so we're going to join forces over that. OB:Mr Dawkins, we have to take a very short break now, but when we come back – how could evolution of religion look like? That's coming up in a moment on Worlds Apart. OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing religion and politics with evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. Now, the main premise of most Abrahamic religions is the so-called Golden Rule, the rule of reciprocity. And in The Selfish Gene, you wrote about that Game Theory Analysis, that shows that reciprocity is an evolutionarily sustainable strategy. And I wonder if what you believe in is more important than how you believe? Because your case is obviously against how people believe in certain things, that you have to think rationally, you have to employ critical thinking. But at the end of the day, good people of faith, and good people of atheism, they all seem to believe in the same thing – that you have to be fair and treat others as you want to be treated? RD: Yes, the Golden Rule is pretty much universal in all societies, and it makes a lot of sense. What's objectionable is when religious people claim that you need religion in order to be good to other people. Of course, you don't. And if people really did base their morality upon religion, they would, by no means, be doing the sorts of things that you and I both agree they should be doing. They would be stoning people to death for adultery, for homosexuality etc. So we don't, as a matter of fact, get our morals from religion. We get them from somewhere else, things like moral philosophy, which is often just an elaboration of the Golden Rule and other things. We get it from that. It happens to coincide with some verses of religious scripture, very much does not coincide with other verses of religious scripture. We pick and choose which verses of religious scripture – the religious people pick and choose which verses of religious scripture they want to believe. The basis on which they pick and choose is the same as the basis that you and I use in order to decide what's moral. It's not other parts of scripture. OB:I would like to ask you perhaps a sexist question. But there are a lot of studies that show that for males, how you do certain things is more important than for females. For example, in war zones, valour and honour are male values, predominantly male values. Women tend to compromise for the sake of their loved ones. I mean, for them, even though they are more attuned to public opinion, in critical situations they are ready to sacrifice that. And that led me to thinking that perhaps what some would call the strident form of atheism is perhaps a male construct? Because for most women, or for many women, it doesn't really matter whether somebody, again, believes in the Bible or in Allah, as long as they are decent human beings, as long as they function in a society in a way that doesn't threaten anyone. RD: I hesitate to tie labels on sexes of that sort. There could be evidence for that, I could imagine psychological evidence for that. I haven't looked into it. I think we need to discuss, in a civilised way, the differences between these two ways of looking at things. And I'd be hesitant before I tied gender labels on them. OB:But I mean, the reason I'm asking, of course, is because many people believe that your very principled, and some would say strident position on that, you put it on an intellectual basis. You believe that it's intellectually driven. And I wonder if you ever thought about it also being influenced by gender factors? You know, we see similar phenomenon, for example, in organised religion, when again most of the high priests arealso male, and those who indoctrinate and postulate values, they also happen to be male? RD: I value the world of the mind. I value truth. I care passionately about what's true. And so to me, as an individual, when I look at a religion, what I care about is is it true, is it really true that there is a God etc. I recognise that emotions are also important. I'm driven by emotion in other issues. I'm driven by emotion, for example, in the question of saving species from going extinct. Things like rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers – it's quite hard to build a purely rational case for saving the elephant, saving the black rhino, saving the tiger. My case is an emotional one, and I'm not ashamed of that. I would weep if we lost the two elephant species that we have. That's emotional, and I defend it on those grounds. Religion, to me, is a matter of intellect, and I take my stand on that. OB:Now, the traditional atheist view has been that with the development of science, religion will die out. And obviously, this is not what we're seeing these days. If you look at some of the IS fighters, there are reports that some of them have advanced scientific degrees. You know, there are chemists and physicists among them. And yet, they seem to have this ability of using critical thinking in one domain, and going totally blind in other areas of life. And I wonder if atheism, in some way, overestimates peoples' ability to think rationally? Are you putting too much faith in human rationality? RD: Well, it looks as though you may be right. I mean, it is quite mysterious to me, the way that people can do that. Identity politics in the case of IS is, no doubt, a part of it. I think there is a capacity in the human mind to separate things out. It's not just in Muslims, it's in Christians as well. There are scientists who, perfectly competent not brilliant scientists, but they're competent scientists, who write – I mean there's an extreme case known to me of an American professor of astronomy who writes competent mathematical papers about astrophysics, which make the assumption that the universe is, whatever it is, 13 billion years old, but privately he believes the universe is only 6,000 years old. So that shows that it's possible for an apparently intelligent and academically competent mind to be split in half and to go through the motions of writing papers in astrophysics, while believing that everything about his paper is nonsense. That's an extreme case, and what we see much more often is less extreme cases of the same thing. OB:Now, I was born in the Soviet Union, and one of the things that made communism degenerate into what we had in later years is that communist ideologues essentially either over-simplified or over-estimated the human nature. That they didn't take into account all the various impulses of people. And I wonder if you would actually like to live in a world with only agnostics and atheists all around? Wouldn't that be a place that perhaps could also degenerate into something that we had in the Soviet Union? Because communism at the beginning was also a theoretical concept. It talked about the goodness of people, sharing, abandoning private property because you don't need it. You know, it counted too much on the better side of human rationality. But at the end of the day, it brought out the worst. Can atheism do the same? RD: Well, you may be saying it's realistic. Sorry, you may be saying it's unrealistic to count on human nature. But I still think it's a worthwhile ideal. I mean, I would like to live in a society where people are rational and sceptical and critical. And that, I think, means they would be atheistic. We live in a society now where nobody believes in fairies and in pink unicorns and things, and that's fine. I think I would like to live in a society where people are critical, sceptical, rational, believe things only when there's evidence and not because of tradition, or emotion, or revelation, or holy books, or priesthoods. OB:Have you ever thought how much critical thinking may be too much? I mean, is there a limit beyond which it may get - RD: No, I don't think there is. I mean, you don't want to apply the sort of extreme sceptical critical thinking to ordinary personal relationships. You know, does my lover love me or not – we use human faculties for that. It would be, life would be unpleasant if we were constantly seeking evidence and doubting our loved ones. So no. But when it comes to beliefs about the real world, about science, about religion, then I think, yes I do want people to be sceptical and critical. OB:And I heard you often talk about, or people rather asking you about religious art. And you always reply that, for example, the existence of the Sistine Chapel is not proof of the belief system that helped to bring it about. But I wonder if you see anything in common between creativity and religion? In the sense of both of them providing some sort of escape from the rule-bound world. Because on some level, you could even argue that religion is just an example of human creativity, creativity of thought, and just giving yourself some respite from the bounds of logic. RD: I'm all for having a respite from all sorts of things, in music, poetry, human love, art. But I would draw the line at using false beliefs about the universe for that purpose. I don't mind poetic – I mean, I could appreciate the poetry of, say, Bach's St Matthew Passion. Beautiful music, and the words – I don't discount the words, it's a tragic story that's being told. I appreciate tragic stories, even if they're not true. Like I appreciate Romeo and Juliet, although it's fiction. So yes, we take refuge in fiction. But don't let's forget that it is fiction. That's the point I would make. OB:And finally, I wonder if religion would stop making those unsubstantiated claims about the origins of the universe, and would embrace some sort of, let's say, definition of God that would be similar to Einstein's – would you be willing to drop your objections against religion? How do you see the evolution of it? RD: I would have no objection to an Einsteinian religion, so long as people don't confuse it with supernaturalism. I think that Einstein made a mistake in using religious language, because people have been misled by that. I mean, Einstein used the word “God”, and he didn't actually believe in any kind of God. He was a pantheist, and I'd be happy to go along with that kind of religion. I just wouldn't call it religion. OB:But how do you see the future of religion, you seem to be agreeing that the social and emotional function that it serves is a very important one. Do you see any institution that could either substitute that, or a way in which religion could evolve? You know, if I just ask you to use your imagination, and let's say imagine a religion in 100 years. RD: I wouldn't call it religion. I think we need human comfort, psychological comfort, human comfort, emotional counselling. All these sorts of things, people get help from each other. We're a social species, we put our arms around each other to comfort each other. We don't need supernatural spooks in order to do that. OB:Absolutely, but my point is that religion, as of now, is pretty much the only, or perhaps very rare social institution that has these open-door policies. Science doesn't. You have to meet certain criteria to be a scientist. RD: (crosstalk) No, science doesn't, but counselling does, psychology does. OB:But you have to pay for that, religion provides it free of charge. RD: Well, then we shouldn't. I mean, I would like to see a more socialistic approach to that kind of thing, to mental health. OB:So, are you advocating the return to the Soviet Union? RD: I think social good will is something we could achieve without overbearing dictatorialordering about. OB:Well Mr Dawkins, it's been a great pleasure talking to you, thank you very much for your time. And please join the conversation on our YouTube, Twitter and Facebook pages, and I hope to see you again, same place, same time, here on Worlds Apart.

"22 Sep, 2014 12:19",​‘Obamastein’ is no Machiavelli,"President Obama seems poised to declare war on the world. American policy in 2014 has taken on a “zombie-like” feverishness aimed at war. Terror has been turned into a horror gag reel these days, as Washington acts out some fetish for chaos in our world. And for those who
  consider Obama a Machiavellian genius, this requires a massive
  intellect. A
  modern day political Frankenstein seems more apt. President Obama seems
  poised to declare war on the world. American policy in 2014 has
  taken on a“zombie-like”feverishness aimed at war.
  Terror has been turned into a horror gag reel these days, as
  Washington acts out some fetish for chaos in our world. And for
  those who consider Obama a Machiavellian genius, this requires a
  massive intellect. A modern day political Frankenstein seems more
  apt. America has armed and sponsored Israel so they can butcher
  Palestinian civilians. We’re prodding NATO moves in Ukraine,
  right on Russia’s doorstep. We’ve fueled a fetish to unseat
  Syria’s Assad, and to perpetuate the Iraq war, maybe forever.
  Yes, Washington’s gone totally biblical, and not in a good way. Meanwhile, we sit on our couches in Omaha or Orlando, reading the
  morning news served up to strike fear and loathing. A thousand
  authors, conjure for you, images of Russian bears devouring
  Europe, of gleaming scimitars slicing the air, and a rerun of
  those twin towers plummeting, down, down, down. But this is a
  time of WikiLeaks, the NSA spies, lies, deceit, and misdirect.
  You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
  blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
  brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
  greed, graft, and mediocre leaders. The fact is ISIS, the Arab
  Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
  Washington policy under Obama. This cannot be repudiated, but it
  can be reasoned. In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr. Ahmed Bensaada
  assembles a body of evidence that the so-called Arab Spring was a
  destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
  the US State Department and historically CIA-funded foundations
  for so-called freedom. No, you c1985annot use the“he’s one
  of them”excuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
  Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
  Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
  Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
  Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
  reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
  Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
  Development (USAID) — and George Soros’ Open Society Institute
  (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce. Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
  that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary. The hierarchy
  and system behind him might be the anti-Christ. As proof the“system”of thought in the west it corrupted, let’s look
  at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment. McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
  industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime’s Senatorial
  superhero. While some of us would like to classify his brand of
  Neo-conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
  presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
  witness to systematic abuses. Case in point, McCain is head of an
  organization known as the International Republican Institute
  (IRI). That institution’s stated goal is to;“advance
  democracy worldwide”– but the“how,”the spread,
  and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us. The
  good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
  analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
  Department. Recently IRI worked with the U.S. – Middle East Partnership
  Initiative (MEPI). The point here is, in many instances where
  Arab Spring or seeming anti-Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
  organizations like McCain’s IRI are somehow present. This quote
  from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: “MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute’s
  (IRI) “Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership” project.
  This project supports independent democratic political activists
  and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
  dialogue. IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
  Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
  research to key partners, stakeholders, civil society
  representatives and influential decision makers.” But still further inside American geo-strategizing, the
  aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
  utter decay of thinking. Thisreportentitled,“On Strategic
  Non-Violent Change,”by one of the world’s leading
  insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
  blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
  corporations. Helvey’s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
  into insurrectionists are well known. But his recent coming out
  over Ukraine’s recent“coup d’état,”this is lesser
  known. Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
  wrong is with us. While most of us know we love peace, the rest
  of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
  killers. It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
  guide for a kind of governing. This guide has been in practice in
  Washington for some decades now. Much has been written about
  Machiavelli’s“The Prince,”but this quote reveals the
  essence of Machiavellian intent: “The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
  world consists chiefly of the vulgar.”- Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
  belief. Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
  Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
  by untimely anti-Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
  from the west.Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
  Peace and Prosperity calls the West’s subversion of the Ukraine
  peace process by NATO a“grand deception.”But beyond
  just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
  of editorials for peace. There simply is no“anti-war”sentiment, not in the press. To sum up here, you don’t have to have a PhD in political science
  to understand Machiavellian intentions. The Italian philosopher
  outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
  congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a“prince”or dictator. Power, as such, was outlined as
  ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise.
  The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
  mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
  makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
  us today. Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
  of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize. The continual
  stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
  Machiavelli’s principles, as do Obama’s grand schemes for health
  care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare. In a
  nutshell, Obama’s advisers are political scientists of the first
  order. To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey’s Einstein Institute piece
  again; “A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
  obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
  public.” Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
  huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli. London, Berlin and
  Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
  reason. But in studying Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
  you’ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
  practice the kingly game. What’s important for us all is the
  purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism. Has America
  acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
  intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
  leave to you. As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
  Shelley’s modern Prometheus is upon us. We have this passage from
  Frankenstein: “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
  make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can
  scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not
  believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the
  other.” Phillip Butler

"27 Aug, 2014 14:49",​Red alert: NATO mission creep advancing to Russian border,"Buried beneath news of the Ice Bucket Challenge, and the latest video release by the Islamic State was an interview by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen that should be of immediate concern to everyone. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge These days, the actual importance of a news story is inversely
  proportional to the number of American media outlets that refuse
  to touch it. That would explain the virtual non-existence of the
  NATO chief’s interview on Wednesday that he gave to a handful of
  European newspapers. Never content to let a good war go to waste, Rasmussen said the
  28-member military bloc would be“spearheading”its way
  into the fleshy flanks of Eastern Europe, just a missile lob away
  from the Russian frontier. The reason –“Russian
  aggression”– should surprise nobody who has been following
  Ukraine’s slow-motion meltdown ever since Kiev attempted to form
  a more perfect union with Russia instead of the European Union.
  That’s when the Western-backed fireworks display, complete with
  John McCain and Victoria Nuland agitating/feeding the crowds in
  central Kiev, exploded, leaving Ukraine on the verge of total
  collapse, and US-Russian relations in tatters. But I digress. Rasmussen chose his words carefully as he proudly
  pointed to NATO’s latest road map to Russia, decorated with brand
  new red flags:""In order to be able to provide such rapid
  reinforcements you also need some reception facilities in host
  nations. So it will involve the pre-positioning of supplies, of
  equipment, preparation of infrastructure, bases, and
  headquarters. The bottom line is you will in the future see a
  more visible NATO presence in the east."" ""Reception facilities?"" Rasmussen makes the militarization of
  Eastern Europe sound so harmless and quaint. In a best-case
  scenario, NATO’s expansionist plans for Eastern Europe – which
  military observers anticipate will be in Poland and the Baltic
  States – will usher in a new arms race on the European continent
  (For those not familiar with modern maps, Latvia and Estonia
  share immediate borders with mainland Russia, whereas Lithuania
  and Poland envelop the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad). There is probably no need to mention the worst-case scenario
  here, since in the event of another global conflagration it won’t
  matter what we brand it because few people will be around to
  remember it. As Albert Einstein once quipped:“I do not know
  with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV
  will be fought with sticks and stones.”  It is important to consider several other remarks by the NATO
  chief since an arms race in Europe will only be a pleasant
  development for the merchants of death from the military
  industrial complex hawking their wares around an increasingly
  shaken planet. Asked whether there would be permanent NATO bases in Eastern
  Europe, Rasmussen did not miss a beat:“The brief answer is
  yes. To prevent misunderstanding I use the phrase 'for as long as
  necessary'. Our eastern allies will be satisfied when they see
  what is actually in the readiness action plan.” Rasmussen said NATO forces could be deployed“within
  hours.” The NATO chief then made some broad generalizations regarding
  Russia that were quite simply wrongheaded. This is no
  insignificant matter because when the average person on the
  street misjudges the geopolitical situation the stakes are not
  very high. But when the leader of the world’s most fearsome
  fighting force flunks a question on very recent history then that
  could be a sign we may be heading for some major turbulence. Here is Rasmussen’s (mis)statement:“We have to face the
  reality that Russia does not consider NATO a partner. Russia is a
  nation that unfortunately for the first time since the Second
  World War has grabbed land by force. Obviously we have to adapt
  to that.” Certainly Rasmussen recalls that it was Russia that requested on
  numerous occasions participation in NATO’s missile defense
  system, arguing that cooperation between the two sides on this
  controversial technology - which, in fact, may give the Europeans
  countries a false sense of security given that the system may not
  work as effectively as advertised – would only strengthen their
  ability to maintain peace and security on the continent. Furthermore, if the system was really designed with Iran in mind,
  as has been claimed, wouldn’t Tehran seriously reconsider any
  evil designs against the European Union if it knew that Russia
  was also on board the project? By flatly refusing Russia’s participation in Europe’s missile
  defense system, NATO and the United States have essentially
  admitted that the so-called reset between Moscow and Washington
  had been a deceptive ruse from the start, designed to make Russia
  believe that the West was sincere about a security partnership
  when in fact it wanted nothing of the sort. Worse, it could mean
  that the missile defense system itself is actually being designed
  with Russia in mind. Indeed, that is the unfortunate conclusion
  that Russia's military has been forced to make. Rasmussen’s remark that Russia“grabbed land by force”–
  apparently in reference to the Crimean Peninsula - is also
  patently wrong. The citizens of Crimea, watching helplessly as
  Ukraine erupted in unbridled violence and bloodshed, made the
  democratic decision to hold a referendum to join the Russian
  Federation. Such a development cannot be labeled a land grab (It
  should be noted that next month Scotland – and without the
  nuisance of bombs going off in their territory – will also vote
  in a referendum to decide whether or not to remain in the United
  Kingdom).  Finally, Rasmussen mused on Russia’s“remarkable change”in terms of its military capabilities over the past. “We also saw a remarkable change in the Russian military
  approach and capability since, for instance, the Georgian war in
  2008. We have seen the Russians improve their ability to act
  swiftly. They can within a very, very, short time convert a major
  military exercise into an offensive military operation,""he
  fretted. As the leader of 28-member NATO, Rasmussen should know better
  than anybody that any military worth its salt should be able to“act swiftly”and“convert a major military exercise
  into an offensive military operation,”as NATO itself has
  been recklessly doing in numerous foreign countries over the last
  decade. The difference, however, between NATO’s long list of global“interventions”and Russia’s conflict with Georgia is
  that Russian peacekeepers were deliberately attacked and killed
  by Georgian forces, thus prompting Russia to respond in kind. Is
  Russia not even permitted to defend itself from foreign attacks,
  even if the size of the invading force is small? Since it has been so long since NATO actually carried out a
  legitimate war it apparently has forgotten what one looks like.
  What NATO has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Pakistan,
  amongst many other places, should give anybody – and most of all,
  the Russians – tremendous pause. In fact, Rasmussen seems more concerned with Russia’s ability to
  defend itself and“act swiftly”than anything else. So how can such comments be explained, and why the sudden
  ratcheting up of tensions with Russia? Although it may seem ridiculous to blame the sudden upsurge in
  bad blood on simple ‘Putin-envy,’ but there could be some truth
  to that. After all, the Russian president has been on a winning
  streak recently, much to the detriment of particular Western
  designs. Not only did the Russian leader almost singlehandedly
  defuse what appeared to be a certain American military offensive
  against Syria, his country also organized one of the most
  successful Olympic games in recent memory. Moscow also got an unexpected visit in the summer by Edward
  Snowden, an American whistleblower from the National Security
  Agency who was granted political asylum by Russia after turning
  over thousands of classified documents to Guardian journalist
  Glenn Greenwald in Hong Kong. His revelations shed a glaring
  light on the extent of the NSA’s controversial intelligence work,
  as well as damaging Washington’s relations with some of its key
  allies, including Germany. However, the real reason for NATO’s continual push eastwards is
  probably due to nothing more than crude geopolitical advantage. The premier Western guru on geopolitical affairs, Zbigniew
  Brzezinski, previously mentioned the strategic importance of
  Ukraine for fulfilling his deranged dream of America becoming“the first, only, and last truly global superpower.” In an interview with Kiev’s Weekly Digest in May 2005, Brzezinski
  coolly calculated that Ukraine“is certainly not a pawn; it
  may not be a queen, but it certainly is an important element on
  the chessboard – one of the most important.”I wonder what
  chess pieces Brzezinski would select to symbolize Poland,
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? That is a question the people of
  those countries may want to consider. Of course, one does not normally make allusions to the greatest
  game of strategy when discussing the question of democracy or
  human rights; that is because in NATO and America’s playbook
  democracy and the interests of the people are only of secondary
  importance. Fear-mongering over an imaginary threat from Russia helps NATO
  break down national doors that would otherwise remain closed.
  Eastern Europe is being sacrificed as a pawn in NATO's great
  game. Robert Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which

"25 Jul, 2014 03:36",Mysterious black holes may be exploding into ‘white holes’,"A new scientific theory suggests that when black holes reach the end of their lifespan, they explode into “white holes” and release all of their matter into space. If true, the theory
  could help put to rest the debate over whether or not black holes
  actually destroy the matter they end up devouring. As noted by Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, when a dying
  star ends up collapsing under its own weight, at some point the
  collapse becomes irreversible, resulting in a black hole that
  consumes light and anything else within its surrounding area.
  Although Vicenotedthat black holes do slowly leak
  radiation over time – ultimately draining the black hole
  completely – this doesn’t account for all the other matter that
  the dying star has consumed. Since quantum theory does not allow for the possibility that
  information can be lost, though, two researchers from France’s
  Aix-Marseille University believe they’ve discovered an
  explanation for this so-called“information paradox.”According to
  physicists Carlo Rovelli and Hal Haggard, a black hole eventually
  reaches a point where it cannot collapse any further and the
  internal pressure begins to push outwards. This essentially turns
  the black hole inside out and expels everything it once consumed
  back into space. Notably, the scientists believe that these white holes are
  created not long after the black hole’s original formation, and
  we humans can’t see it because gravity dilates time and makes the
  black hole’s lifespan seem to last for billions or trillions of
  years. Their current calculation is that it only takes
  a few thousandths of a
  second for a black hole to turn into a white hole. “Importantly, the process is very long seen from the outside, but
  is very short for a local observer at a small radius,” the
  researchers wrote in a paper on the subject, according to Vice. Ron Cowen, a science writer at Nature,explainedfurther. “If the authors are correct, tiny black holes that formed during
  the very early history of the Universe would now be ready to pop
  off like firecrackers and might be detected as high-energy cosmic
  rays or other radiation. In fact, they say, their work could
  imply that some of the dramatic flares commonly considered to be
  supernova explosions could in fact be the dying throes of tiny
  black holes that formed shortly after the Big Bang.” Although Rovelli and Haggard aren’t completely dismissing the
  idea that black holes leak radiation, they said the trickles of
  energy would not be sufficient enough to deplete the dying stars
  of all the energy they’ve consumed. Radiation may very well seep
  out, but their work is primarily concerned with discovering what
  happens inside a black hole. Still, both Rovelli and Haggard admitted that their theory needs
  to be tested further with more comprehensive calculations. If
  research confirms their ideas, however, theoretical physicist
  Steven Giddings of the University of California Santa Barbara
  says, “It would be important. Understanding how information
  escapes from a black hole is the key question for the quantum
  mechanics of black holes, and possibly for quantum gravity
  itself.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/175436-black-holes-exploding-white-holes/
"23 Jun, 2014 12:03",Time-traveling photons connect general relativity to quantum mechanics,"Scientists have simulated time travel by using particles of light acting as quantum particles sent away and then brought back to their original space-time location. This is a huge step toward marrying two of the most irreconcilable theories in physics. Since traveling all the way to a black hole to see if an object
  you’re holding would bend, break or put itself back together in
  inexplicable ways is a bit of a trek, scientists have decided to
  find a point of convergence between general relativity and
  quantum mechanics in lab conditions, and they achieved success. Australian researchers from the UQ’s School of Mathematics and
  Physics wanted to plug the holes in the discrepancies that exist
  between two of our most commonly accepted physics theories, which
  is no easy task: on the one hand, you have Einstein’s theory of
  general relativity, which predicts the behavior of massive
  objects like planets and galaxies; but on the other, you have
  something whose laws completely clash with Einstein’s – and that
  is the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes our world at
  the molecular level. And this is where things get interesting: we
  still have no concrete idea of all the principles of movement and
  interaction that underpin this theory. Natural laws of space and time simply break down there. The light particles used in the study are known as photons, and
  in this University of Queensland study, they stood in for actual
  quantum particles for the purpose of finding out how they behaved
  while moving through space and time. The team simulated the behavior of a single photon that travels
  back in time through a wormhole and meets its older self – an
  identical photon.""We used single photons to do this but the
  time-travel was simulated by using a second photon to play the
  part of the past incarnation of the time traveling photon,”said UQ Physics
  Professor Tim Ralph asquotedby The Speaker. The findings werepublishedin the journal Nature
  Communications and gained support from the country’s key
  institutions on quantum physics. Some of the biggest examples of why the two approaches can’t be
  reconciled concern the so-called space-time loop. Einstein
  suggested that you can travel back in time and return to the
  starting point in space and time. This presented a problem, known
  commonly as the 'grandparents paradox,' theorized by Kurt Godel
  in 1949: if you were to travel back in time and prevent your
  grandparents from meeting, and in so doing prevent your own
  birth, the classical laws of physics would prevent you from being
  born. But Tim Ralph has reminded that in 1991, such situations could be
  avoided by harnessing quantum mechanics’ flexible laws:“The
  properties of quantum particles are ‘fuzzy’ or uncertain to start
  with, so this gives them enough wiggle room to avoid inconsistent
  time travel situations,”he said. There are still ways in which science hasn’t tested the meeting
  points between general relativity and quantum mechanics – such as
  when relativity is tested under extreme conditions, where its
  laws visibly seem to bend, just like near the event horizon of a
  black hole. But since it’s not really easy to approach one, the UQ scientists
  were content with testing out these points of convergence on
  photons. ""Our study provides insights into where and how nature might
  behave differently from what our theories predict,""Professor Ralph said. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/167752-time-travel-quantum-light/
"17 Jun, 2014 11:48",'Western policy towards Iraq is a kind of madness',"While UK Foreign Secretary William Hague says the US and the UK were right to invade Iraq, Tony Blair is calling to re-invade, which is ""complete madness"", British MP George Galloway told RT. RT:Former UK
  Prime Minister Tony Blair is constantly commenting on the Middle
  East. Why doesn't Blair just disappear like Bush - we hear almost
  nothing from him these days? George Galloway:As a national consensus
  emerging here, stretching from the Mayor of London across
  Parliament and most of the media, including right-wing newspapers
  that supported that war at the time that Mr. Blair may have
  become mentally unhinged. Certainly Einstein’s definition of
  madness, namely that to do the same things over and over again
  and expect a different result means you are probably mentally
  unhinged, seems to apply here because Mr. Blair was this very
  weekend not only defending what he did, and there are precious
  very few people anywhere in the world, who will be found to come
  on television and defend that, but to say that we should do it
  again. Mr. Blair wants us to re-invade Iraq. RT:Why are former officials like Tony Blair
  and current ones like William Hague still defending Iraq? It's
  collapsing. Do they really think the current situation has
  nothing to do with invading in 2003? GG:Mr. Hague said that we were right to invade
  Iraq. He is not saying“We should invade it again”,
  Blair is. Moreover, he is saying that we are only in this
  position because we didn’t invade Syria. And here we come to the
  ultimate paradox of our times. Britain and the US are supporting
  these Al-Qaeda fanatics in Syria, which is only a couple of hours
  drive away from their heartland in Iraq, while encouraging us
  that the end of the world is coming when those Al-Qaeda fanatics
  cross over into Iraq. Those of us who are against Al-Qaeda
  wherever they are, of course, being amply vindicated because the
  pictures that the fanatics put out themselves, I suppose we
  should be grateful that they are not yet eating people’s hearts
  like they were doing, and videoing themselves for the
  entertainment of the world doing it has not yet emerged from
  Iraq. But the hideous throat cutting and mass executions of
  people, the humiliation of people as they kill them is emerging
  now from the fanatics themselves. But the truth is that this
  group, ISIS, used to be called the ISIL, they became strong and
  powerful because of Western monetary and so-called non-lethal
  military aid. These Toyota vehicles that they drove into Mosel in
  were given to them by the British and American governments, but
  across the border in Syria. This is the kind of madness that
  Western policy has become. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"5 Jun, 2014 13:40","​Tiananmen Square June 4, 1989: What really happened?","This week marks twenty five years since the world was told of a brutal massacre by the Chinese Peoples’ Liberation Army of “thousands” of peacefully protesting pro-democracy students in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

  government and to impose economic and military sanctions which in
  many cases exist to the present day. A recent release of a
  diplomatic telegram from then-US Ambassador to China, James E.
  Lilley, to Washington sheds new light on what really happened
  that June 4. According to the mainstream Western version of events, thousands
  of Chinese university students began their sit-in protest
  demanding democracy and transparency from the Communist
  government in April and into May 1989 in the huge Tiananmen
  Square, directly across from the historic Forbidden City edifice
  in central Beijing. They defiantly faced off against the Chinese
  Communist Party (CCP) and the People’s Liberation Army. On May
  20, 1989, the CCP imposed martial law and ordered truckloads of
  soldiers to Beijing to take back the square from protesters. The
  Westernaccounthas it that then, on June 3 into June
  4, PLA soldiers opened fire and killed “up to 1000 student
  protesters.” WikiLeaks, the website that received hundreds of thousands of
  pages of intercepted diplomatic correspondence from the US State
  Department, has released a classified diplomatic cable from
  then-Beijing Ambassador James Lilley to Washington dated July 12,
  1989 more than four weeks after the events. In his report, Lilley
  writes the following shocking version of events: OF JUNE 3-4 EVENTS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE 1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 2. SUMMARY- DURING A RECENT MEETING, A LATIN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT
  AND HIS WIFE PROVIDED POLOFF AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON
  JUNE 3-4 AND THEIR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN
  SQUARE. ALTHOUGH THEIR ACCOUNT GENERALLY FOLLOWS THOSE PREVIOUSLY
  REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND
  CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE SQUARE. THEY WERE ABLE TO ENTER
  AND LEAVE THE SQUARE SEVERAL TIMES AND WERE NOT HARASSED BY
  TROOPS. REMAINING WITH STUDENTS BY THE MONUMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S
  HEROES UNTIL THE FINAL WITHDRAWAL, THE DIPLOMAT SAID THERE WERE
  NO MASS SHOOTINGS OF STUDENTS IN THE SQUARE OR AT THE MONUMENT.
  END SUMMARY. (Emphasis mine - WE) Lilley in his memo goes on to name the Latin American couple as
  Chilean Second Secretary Carlos Gallo and his wife. They had been
  dining near the square and went to observe events. As foreign
  diplomats, they managed to move in the crowd without difficulty.
  They said the PLA had evidently been ordered not to interfere
  with foreigners. They reported hearing shots and wounded students
  were brought to a Red Cross tent for care. Then the US Ambassador
  reported,  8. GALLO EVENTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE RED CROSS STATION, AGAIN
  HOPING THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT FIRE ON THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE.
  HE WATCHED THE MILITARY ENTER THE SQUARE AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY
  MASS FIRING OF WEAPONS INTO THE CROWDS, ALTHOUGH SPORADIC GUNFIRE
  WAS HEARD. HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE TROOPS WHICH ENTERED THE
  SQUARE WERE ACTUALLY ARMED ONLY WITH ANTI-RIOT GEAR--TRUNCHEONS
  AND WOODEN CLUBS… (Emphasis added - WE) Then Gallo reports in a subsequent meeting with the US Embassy’s
  political officer a most remarkable development which was
  entirely blocked out of sensational Western media. The student
  leaders and the PLA reached an agreement that the protestors
  would be allowed to leave peacefully if they disbanded their
  sit-in: 10. ALTHOUGH GUNFIRE COULD BE HEARD, GALLO SAID THAT APART FROM
  SOME BEATING OF STUDENTS, THERE WAS NO MASS FIRING INTO THE CROWD
  OF STUDENTS AT THE MONUMENT. WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED SOME
  REPORTEDLY EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF MASSACRES AT THE MONUMENT WITH
  AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, GALLO SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH SLAUGHTER.
  ONCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE STUDENTS TO WITHDRAW, LINKING
  HANDS TO FORM A COLUMN, THE STUDENTS LEFT THE SQUARE THROUGH THE
  SOUTHEAST CORNER. ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE, INCLUDING GALLO, LEFT.
  THE FEW THAT ATTEMPTED TO REMAIN BEHIND WERE BEATEN AND DRIVEN TO
  JOIN THE END OF THE DEPARTING PROCESSION. ONCE OUTSIDE THE
  SQUARE, THE STUDENTS HEADED WEST ON QIANMEN DAJIE WHILE GALLO
  HEADED EAST TO HIS CAR. (Emphasismine- WE) The report of a deal between student protestors and the military
  to end the protest peacefully and leave had been told to me by
  various young Chinese in personal accounts on recent visits to
  Beijing, but until this WikiLeaks release of the Lilley cable, it
  could never be confirmed. Now it seems clear that the entire
  story of “thousands” of dead students at Tiananmen Square, whose
  very name in the West is synonymous with brutal government
  suppression of democracy, was largely a fabrication. The protests
  were real, but not the horrendous stories of slaughter. Indeed, as I have written elsewhere, there is rather strong
  circumstantial evidence that suggests that the CIA and US State
  Department played a key role in trying to goad on the student
  protestors at Tiananmen Square; much like the CIA did in Hungary
  in 1956, in order to provoke a government bloodbath of
  repression. Around the same time as Tiananmen protests in
  April-June 1989, the Chinese government banned a Chinese NGO of
  US operator George Soros, the Fund for the Reform and Opening of
  China, after interrogating its Chinese director in August 1989
  and claiming that the Soros China fund had links to the CIA. The
  Soros Fund according to Chinese reports had been supported by
  ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. Significantly in addition to the Soros Fund, Gene Sharp of the
  Cambridge Massachusetts Albert Einstein Institution, whose
  handbooks on “non-violence as a method of warfare” have been the
  “how-to” textbook for every color revolution to date, was in
  Beijing days before the Tiananmenevents. Then-US Ambassador Lilley himself was
  a career CIA officer who, like then-President George H.W. Bush,
  had been in the secretive Yale Skull & Bones society, and who
  was with Bush at the CIA. The circumstantial evidence points to
  an attempted US destabilization of China designed to coincide
  with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, with Lilley the
  likely on-the-ground coordinator. When the PLA failed to fill Beijing with the blood of “thousands”
  of student democracy martyrs, Washington could simply go with
  fabrication of a fantasy or virtual massacre and, because of its
  overwhelming control of mainstream media; most of the world could
  believe the Washington version. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"19 May, 2014 16:06",Scientists find way to turn light into matter,"Researchers in London have found a way to make matter from light, using high powered lasers. The idea behind the theory was first thought up 80 years ago by two physicists, who were to work later on creating the world’s first atomic bomb. In 1934, US physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler worked out
  that, on very rare occasions, two particles of light (photons)
  couldcombineto produce an electron and a
  positron. They were never able to carry out their theory in
  practice as they believed it would be almost impossible. However, Steve Rose, who is professor of physics at Imperial
  College London, says,“today, nearly 80 years later, we
  proved them wrong.”Rose went on to add,""despite all
  physicists accepting the theory to be true, when Breit and
  Wheeler first proposed the theory, they said that they never
  expected it be shown in the laboratory.” “What was so surprising to us was the discovery of how we can
  create matter directly from light using the technology that we
  have today in the UK. As we are theorists we are now talking to
  others who can use our ideas to undertake this landmark
  experiment,”Rose continued. They have managed to create a machine called a photon-photon
  collider, which would turn light into matter. However, the type
  of matter they are looking to create will be invisible to the
  naked eye. Oliver Pike, the lead researcher of thestudy, said that the experiment would be the
  most elegant demonstration of Einstein's famous formula.""The
  Breit-Wheeler process is the simplest way matter can be made from
  light and one of the purest demonstrations of E=mc2,""he
  told The Guardian. The process works something like this. Firstly, the scientists
  would use an extremely powerful laser to speed up the electrons
  to travel almost at the speed of light. These electrons would
  then be fired at a slab of gold. This would create a beam of
  photons, which are a billion times more powerful than visible
  light. The next stage sees a high energy laser being fired into a
  hohlraum, which is the German for an ‘empty room.’ As a
  consequence, light as bright as that emitted by stars is produced
  and in the final stage, the first beam of the photons is directed
  towards the hohlraum, where the two streams collide, which forms
  electrons and positrons. The study has been published in the journal Nature Photonics. The scientists hope that the process will be demonstrated over
  the next 12 months, and if it is successful, it will encourage
  physicists to study how subatomic particles behave. Pike stated,""such a collider could be used to study fundamental physics
  with a very clean experimental setup: pure light goes in, matter
  comes out. The experiment would be the first demonstration of
  this.” The experiment would recreate a process that was important in the
  first 100 seconds of the universe and that is also seen in gamma
  ray bursts - the biggest explosions in the universe and one of
  the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/159944-physics-light-turn-matter/

"18 Mar, 2014 00:40",​Discovery of rapid ‘cosmic inflation’ boosts Big Bang theory,"Scientists have detected the first direct proof of cosmic inflation, a theory that the universe expanded by 100 trillion trillion times just after the Big Bang. If confirmed, the discovery marks a major point in understanding the universe's origins. Around 14 billion years ago, waves of gravity rapidly pulsated
  through space immediately following the Big Bang, experts
  announced Monday at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
  Astrophysics. Cosmic inflation was predicted by Albert Einstein’s theory of
  general relativity, but proof of the“first tremors of the
  Big Bang”provides an important connection to his work and
  the more enigmatic field of quantum mechanics. The researchers stationed a telescope called BICEP2 in the South
  Pole which eventually found evidence of the oldest light in the
  universe, AFPreported. BICEP2 was aimed at the“Southern Hole”beyond the
  galaxy where there is a low amount of dust or other extra
  galactic material that can obscure sight lines. At a strength of 1016 gigaelectronvolts - higher than the
  researchers expected - the telescope detected small fluctuations
  in light waves within the hazy microwave glow left from the Big
  Bang. The gravitational waves reach back to just 380,000 years
  after the Big Bang, when the universe exploded in all directions
  from a single point of infinitely dense energy.  ""The CMB (cosmic microwave background) is a snapshot of the
  Universe 380,000 years after the big bang, when the radiation
  first streamed freely into space,""head researcher John
  Kovac said in an interview with Nature.""But the
  gravitational-wave signal was imprinted on the CMB a tiny
  fraction of a second after the birth of the Universe."" Kovac said years of observations led to Monday’s announcement. ""Detecting this signal is one of the most important goals in
  cosmology today. A lot of work by a lot of people has led up to
  this point,”he said, adding his team analyzed the data for
  three years to ensure its validity. The project included researchers from the likes of the University
  of Minnesota, Stanford University, the California Institute of
  Technology, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in addition to
  the Harvard-Smithsonian Center of Astrophysics. NASA said the data""not only help confirm that the universe
  inflated dramatically, but are providing theorists with the first
  clues about the exotic forces that drove space and time
  apart."" Harvard theorist Avi Loeb told AFP the findings offer""new
  insights into some of our most basic questions: Why do we exist?
  How did the universe begin?” ""These results are not only a smoking gun for inflation, they

"13 Feb, 2014 01:47",Nuclear fusion breakthrough: US scientists make crucial step to limitless power,"A team of scientists in California announced Wednesday they are one step closer to developing the almost mythical pollution-free, controlled fusion-energy reaction, though the goal of full “ignition” is still far off. Researchers at the federally-funded Lawrence Livermore National
  Laboratory revealed in a study released Wednesday in the
  peer-reviewed journal Nature that, for the first time, one of
  their experiments has yielded more energy out of fusion than was
  used in the fuel that created the reaction. In a 10-story building the size of three football fields, the
  Livermore scientists“used 192 lasers to compress a pellet of
  fuel and generate a reaction in which more energy came out of the
  fuel core than went into it,”wrote the Washington Post.“Ignition”would mean more energy was produced than was
  used in the entire process. ""We're closer than anyone's gotten before,""said Omar
  Hurricane, a physicist at Livermore and lead author of the study.""It does show there's promise."" The process ultimately mimics the processes in the core of a star
  inside the laboratory’s hardware. Nuclear fusion, which is how
  the sun is heated, creates energy when atomic nuclei fuse and
  form a larger atom. ""This isn't like building a bridge,""Hurricane told USA
  Today in an interview.""This is an exceedingly hard problem.
  You're basically trying to produce a star, on a small scale, here
  on Earth."" A fusion reactor would operate on a common form of hydrogen found
  in sea water and create minimal nuclear waste while not being
  nearly as volatile as a traditional nuclear-fission reactor.
  Fission, used in nuclear power plants, works by splitting atoms. Hurricane said he does not know how long it will take to reach
  that point, where fusion is a viable energy source. ""Picture yourself halfway up a mountain, but the mountain is
  covered in clouds,""he told reporters on a conference call
  Wednesday.“And then someone calls you on your satellite
  phone and asks you, ‘How long is it going to take you to climb to
  the top of the mountain?’ You just don’t know.” The beams of the 192 lasers Livermore used can pinpoint extreme
  amounts of energy in billionth-of-a-second pulses on any target.
  Hurricane said the energy produced by the process was about twice
  the amount that was in the fuel of the plastic-capsule target.
  Though the amount of energy yielded equaled only around 1 percent
  of energy delivered by the lasers to the capsule to ignite the
  process. “When briefly compressed by the laser pulses, the isotopes
  fused, generating new particles and heating up the fuel further
  and generating still more nuclear reactions, particles and
  heat,”wrote the Washington Post, adding that the feedback
  mechanism is known as“alpha heating.” Debbie Callahan, co-author of the study, said the capsule had to
  be compressed 35 times to start the reaction,“akin to
  compressing a basketball to the size of a pea,”according to
  USA Today. While applauding the Livermore team’s findings, fusion experts
  added researchers have“a factor of about 100 to go.” ""These results are still a long way from ignition, but they
  represent a significant step forward in fusion research,""said Mark Herrmann of the Sandia National Laboratories' Pulsed
  Power Sciences Center.""Achieving pressures this large, even
  for vanishingly short times, is no easy task."" Livermore is the site of the multi-billion-dollar National
  Ignition Facility, funded by the National Nuclear Security
  Administration. Fusion experiments aren’t the only function of
  the lab; for example, it also studies the processes of nuclear
  weapon explosions. Long-pursued by scientists dating back to Albert Einstein, fusion
  energy does not emit greenhouse gases or leave behind radioactive
  waste. Since the 1940s, researchers have employed magnetic fields
  to contain high-temperature hydrogen fuel. Laser use began in the
  1970s. ""We have waited 60 years to get close to controlled
  fusion,""said, Steve Cowley, of the United Kingdom's Culham
  Center for Fusion Energy. He added scientists are""now
  close""with both magnets and lasers.""We must keep at
  it."" Stewart Prager - director of the Princeton Plasma Physics
  Laboratory, which studies fusion using magnets - told the Post he
  was optimistic about fusion energy’s future. “In 30 years, we’ll have electricity on the grid produced by
  fusion energy – absolutely,”Prager said.“I think the
  open questions now are how complicated a system will it be, how
  expensive it will be, how economically attractive it will
  be.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/fusion-energy-power-ignition-806/
"3 Feb, 2014 00:42",Coldest spot in known universe: NASA to study almost absolute zero matter at ISS,"NASA has revealed its plans to create the coldest spot in the known universe on board the International Space Station in 2016. The researchers are preparing to study matter at temperatures near absolute zero, revealing the world of quantum mechanics. The US space agency has announced that its researchers are
  currently working on theCold Atom Laboratory,“the coolest spot
  in the universe”, which will be ready for installation
  inside the International Space Station by December 2015. There are several reasons underlying the scientific drive to
  explore characteristics and qualities of matter in conditions
  that are difficult to replicate on Earth. Space’s low
  temperatures, unattainable in terrestrial laboratories, reveal
  the wave nature of atoms, as well as possibly new phenomena. The
  absence of gravity additionally allows such experiments to last
  longer – up to 20 seconds. “We’re going to study matter at temperatures far colder than
  are found naturally,”saidthe project’s head scientist Rob
  Thompson of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).""We aim to push
  effective temperatures down to 100 pico-Kelvin."" One hundred pico-Kelvin is remarkable in that it is a mere ten
  billionth of a degree above absolute zero (0K or −273.15°C) – a
  point on an imaginary thermometer where all thermal activity of
  atoms theoretically halts. When temperatures are so low, our
  traditional ideas of atomic behavior cease to apply. The matter
  is no longer solid, liquid or gas – its atoms tend to create
  quantum forms of matter. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes intricate
  and bizarre light and matter rules on an atomic scale. It is a
  wonderland where nothing is certain, where objects behave both as
  particles and as waves, and where matter can be in two places at
  once.“We’re entering the unknown,”said Thompson.  With the help of the Cold Atom Lab, the researchers will be able
  to conduct many exciting experiments. “We’ll begin by studying Bose-Einstein Condensates,”he
  said.“The Cold Atom Lab will allow us to study these objects
  at perhaps the lowest temperatures ever.” The condensates, named after Satyendra Bose and Albert Einstein,
  who predicted them in the beginning of the 20th century, were, in
  fact, discovered only in 1995. And in 2001, Eric Cornell and Carl
  Wieman shared the Nobel Prize with Wolfgang Ketterle for their
  independent discovery of the intriguing capacity of rubidium and
  sodium atoms to form a single wave of matter when cooled to
  temperatures slightly above the absolute zero threshold. The researches, planned by NASA, are aimed at studying ultra-cold
  quantum gases in the microgravity of the ISS besides other
  experiments. The technology, which would allow such experiments, includes an
  atom chip with on-window wires that enable simultaneous magnetic
  trapping and optical manipulation, in addition to compound
  silicon and glass substrate technology that leads to both
  magnetic and optical control of ultra-cold atoms. The Cold Atom Lab, which actually is designed“for use by
  multiple investigators”and is“upgradable and
  maintainable on orbit,”is scheduled to be launched inside
  the ISS in early 2016, where it will be able to function for 5
  years. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/iss-coldest-spot-universe-544/
"10 Jan, 2014 11:32",Scottish independence issue reminiscent of solidarity,"I will be voting ‘No’ in this year's referendum on Scottish independence. I will do so as a statement of solidarity with working people the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. There is undoubtedly much that is regressive – make that
  despicable – about the British state. The monarchy, the House of
  Lords, the country’s history of empire, colonialism, and its
  recent history of sowing carnage and chaos in the Middle East –
  all of those things add up to a damning indictment of a state
  formed in 1707 in the interests of a rising mercantile class,
  committed to colonial expansion and the super exploitation of the
  planet’s resources. However, the notion that Scotland and the Scots were not party to
  this history – or played only a marginal role – is an insult to
  truth. The ill-fated Darien Scheme of 1698-1700, an attempt by
  the then independent Scotland to establish a colony in what is
  now Panama, succeeded in bankrupting the country, which led
  inexorably to the bulk of the Scottish aristocracy and merchant
  class – who made up the Scottish Parliament of the day - voting
  to enter the current union with England in 1707. Thereafter Scots
  played a disproportionate role in building the British Empire as
  generals, officers, and soldiers in the army, colonial
  administrators, slavers, and merchants - in the process creating
  great personal fortunes, and establishing Glasgow as the second
  city of the empire. The unintended effect of the 1707 union was the homogenization of
  the working class throughout the newly formed British state. This
  homogenization was based on the common misery they were suffering
  at the hands of the factory and mill owners who controlled their
  lives under an economic system of unfettered capitalism. The need
  to organize collectively in order to resist the brutal conditions
  of the lives of workers across Britain transcended every other
  difference – whether on grounds of nationality, race, religion,
  or gender. This gave rise to the emergence of the trade union
  movement followed by the Labour Party at the beginning of the
  20th century, reflecting the growth in size and consciousness of
  a British working class. This class identity remains relevant
  today at a time when the nation is being ruled by the most
  extreme and callous Tory government in generations. Simply put,
  it dictates that a bus driver in Glasgow has more in common with
  a bus driver in Newcastle, Liverpool, or Cardiff than he does
  with a wealthy fellow Scot. With this in mind, I have increasingly found some of the
  arguments being made in support of independence by progressives
  and socialists within the Yes campaign disappointing. The central
  of those - namely that voting‘Yes’will rid Scotland of
  the Tories - is not only weak, it is cowardly. Firstly, you may
  get rid of the Tories but that doesn't mean you will get rid of
  Tory ideas, a few of which are front and center in the SNP's
  recently produced independence manifesto (or white paper), titled‘Scotland’s Future’. The Scottish Nationalist Party’s
  positions on corporation tax, the monarchy, and NATO membership
  would sit more than comfortably in the pages of a Tory manifesto.  More importantly, the idea that abandoning millions of people
  who've stood with us - and us with them - in trade union
  struggles, political campaigns, progressive movements, etc, for
  generations - the idea that this can be considered progress is
  anathema to me. The analogy of the Titanic applies, wherein
  rather than woman and children, it is Scots to the lifeboats and
  to hell with everybody else. Nationalism, unless rooted in national oppression, is a
  regressive ideology. It obscures the real dividing line in
  society - namely class - offering instead an abstracted analysis
  of the world through a national prism that takes zero account of
  social and economic factors, thus offering nothing but more of
  the same under a different flag. It is no wonder that Albert
  Einstein described nationalism as an ‘infantile disease’. Our nationality is an accident of birth. It means nothing. You
  can't eat a flag. A flag doesn't heat a home or put food on the
  table. Nationalism offers a largely mythologized history in the
  process of inviting us to embrace a national interest, one that
  can only relate to the world behind false divisions of national,
  ethnic, or racial differences. Even when it comes to culture, the
  terms national culture obscures more than it illuminates. The
  traditional culture of the Highlands in Scotland, for example,
  means little to me as a Lowland Scot. I can appreciate it, of
  course, but not anymore or with any more feeling than I do any
  culture anywhere in the world. The concept of the modern nation state is a relatively recent
  one. It traces its roots to the Treaty of Westphalia in the
  mid-17th century, which brought to an end the Thirty Years War in
  Europe. Out of it emerged the concept of national sovereignty, a
  political concept reflective of the early stages of capitalist
  economic development, with the resultant growth in international
  trade and the need to expand and protect both markets and sources
  of natural resources required to feed burgeoning manufacturing
  industries in the interests of competing capitalists. However, much has changed in 350 years. In 2013 economic
  sovereignty does not lie with national governments as it did at
  one time. Today economic sovereignty in the West lies with global
  capital under that extreme variant of capitalism known as
  neoliberalism - or the free market. The notion that separation
  from a larger state would allow said smaller state to forge a
  social democratic utopia without challenging neoliberal nostrums
  is simply not credible. A patchwork of smaller states plays into
  the hands of global capital, as it means more competition for
  inward investment, which means global corporations are able to
  negotiate more favorable terms in return for that investment. The
  result is a race to the bottom as workers in one state compete
  for jobs with workers in neighboring states. In this regard it is
  surely no accident that Rupert Murdoch is a vocal supporter of
  Scottish independence.  Support for Scottish independence among progressives in Scotland
  is rooted in despair over a status quo of Tory barbarity. This is
  understandable. For the past three decades working class
  communities throughout the UK have suffered a relentless assault
  under both Conservative and Labour administrations. The Labour
  Party, under the baneful influence and leadership of Tony Blair
  and his New Labour clique, came to be unrecognizable from the
  party that created the welfare state, including the NHS, the
  party that once held full employment as a guiding principle of
  its economic and social policy. The embrace of free market
  nostrums under New Labour meant that the structural inequality
  that obtained after 18 years of Tory rule remained more or less
  intact. The market was now the undisputed master of all it
  surveyed. The consequence of Labour’s shift to the right has been
  to give rise to cynicism, disappointment, and lack of faith in
  politics among large swathes of voters, evinced in ever lower
  turnouts at elections. Issues such as the lies and subterfuge
  surrounding Britain going to war in Iraq in 2003, the MPs’
  expenses scandal of 2011, followed by the phone hacking scandal -
  during which the unhealthy relationship between the owners and
  editors of tabloid newspapers and politicians was revealed - has
  only deepened this cynical disregard for politics and politicians
  in Britain, giving rise to anti-politics as the default position
  of many voters. In Scotland – for decades a Labour Party stronghold – devolution
  has allowed a protest vote to make the electorate’s feelings
  towards this Labour Party betrayal of its founding principles
  known at the ballot box. Regardless, the most significant protest
  has been a non-vote, with turnouts at elections in Scotland
  following the pattern of the rest of the country in remaining
  low. For example, there was only a 50 percent turnout at the last
  Scottish Parliamentary elections in 2011, out of which the
  Scottish National Party (SNP) emerged with an overall majority,
  the first time any party has managed to do so since the Scottish
  Parliament came into existence in 1999. However the argument that Scotland is more left leaning than the
  rest of the UK is one that seeks to conflate conservatism with
  England in its entirety, rather than a specific region of the
  country, which in conjunction with the antiquated first past the
  post electoral system of Westminster elections has thrown up Tory
  governments that are unrepresentative of where the majority of
  England and the rest of the UK sits politically. Scotland is no
  more left leaning than the deindustrialized North East, North
  West, and Midlands of England. Nor is it any more left leaning
  than Wales. The working class in Scotland is not any more
  progressive than its English or Welsh counterpart. As a consequence, my‘No’vote in September will be both
  a rejection of nationalism as a progressive alternative to the
  status quo and a statement of solidarity with all who are
  suffering under this Tory government – not only in Scotland but
  throughout the United Kingdom. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"19 Dec, 2013 08:34",World's most powerful satellite telescope 'Gaia' launched to map Milky Way in 3D,"Europe has launched a billion dollar state of the art space telescope, that should bring back home the most detailed 3D map of our galaxy. The five-year-long space voyage of the telescope named Gaia has
  started from Kourou in French Guiana, where it has taken off on
  top of a Russian-built Soyuz-Fregat rocket. The European Space Agency has dubbed the Gaia telescope “the
  billion star surveyor” which will conduct “the biggest
  cosmic census yet”. A billion stars might be only one
  percent of the galaxy; however the previous research mission the
  Hipparcos catalogued a thousand times less celestial objects
  between 1989 and 1993. A#GAIAlaunch collage!pic.twitter.com/3HEzFbtd9w — ✨The Solar System✨ (@The_SolarSystem)December 19, 2013 The unprecedented scope of the stars to be surveyed is
  accompanied by the unprecedented precision with which it’s
  achieved. The detail will be a thousand times higher than can be
  done from the ground. The scientific community is holding its
  breath for a breakthrough. “For every professional astronomer there’s no need to explain
  how fundamental Gaia is. Everyone knows that when you get
  distances to stars it’s the basis for all the rest of the
  astronomy. Everyone is looking forward to getting this data in
  their hands,” said Timo Prusti, ESA's Gaia Project
  Scientist.  During the five years of the space mission each of a billion
  stars Gaia is tasked with charting will have its position, motion
  and characteristics observed 70 times. That’s going to be done
  with the help of the largest digital camera to travel into space.
  It’s nearly one billion pixels are a hundred times more than your
  average every day camera. Sophisticated lenses will allow Gaia to detect celestial objects
  that are “a million times fainter than the unaided human eye
  can see”, according to ESA. Gaia will be able to provide a trove of data.  “If the final catalogue with just the summary of all data
  accumulated by Gaia was printed and all volumes were nicely
  aligned in my bookshelf, the row of 53,542 volumes would extend
  1.3 km,” says Jos de Bruijne, ESA Gaia Deputy Project
  Scientist. A more hi-tech comparison says the telescope will
  bring back 200,000 DVDs worth of data. Six centers around Europe will be handling the avalanche of
  information. Big expectations are placed on a supercomputer in
  Toulouse, south western France, capable of carrying out six
  thousand billion operations a second. Gaia will do its research from the so-called Lagrange point or
  L2. It’s 1.5 million kilometers from earth and allows for
  observation of space unhampered by the Sun, Earth and Moon. Apart from creating a 3D map of the Milky Way, Gaia will also
  shed light on hundreds of thousands of asteroids and comets
  within our Solar System and seven thousand planets beyond it.
  It’s also going to study tens of thousands of ‘failed’ stars,
  called brown dwarfs, as well as twenty thousand emerging,
  exploding stars, called supernova. Gaia is also expected to
  provide new tests of Albert Einstein’s relativity theory.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/european-telescope-milky-way-477/
"13 Dec, 2013 17:43",Physics breakthrough: Is the universe a giant hologram?,"Scientists have found the “clearest evidence yet” that the universe we inhabit is a giant hologram, paving the way towards reconciling one of physics’ most pressing issues: the relationship between Einstein’s theory of relativity and quantum physics. In other words, we could be living inside a giant 3D projection
  of what is actually a two-dimensional space, similar to an IMAX
  movie theater screen or a painting. Or one could simply imagine
  the experience of looking at a three-dimensional object from
  various angles and seeing it change shape according to the point
  of observation. The new experimental simulations proposed by Japanese scientist,
  Yoshifumi Hyakutake, and his team at the Ibaraki University of
  Japan tackle the varying energies of black holes discovered in
  parallel universes. But it also goes a long way towards marrying
  Einstein’s theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum
  mechanics as the two main theories describing our universe. The findings were published in the journal, Nature, on December
  10. In physics, the 'holographic principle' is a property
      described in string theory. It represents a volume of space
      whose entire information can be imagined as encoded on a
      boundary of that selected space. The holographic principle
      started by first observing black hole thermodynamics. There,
      it was noticed that the informational content of all the
      objects that got sucked in by the hole can be seen in a
      scaled sense on the hole's event horizon. Einstein, in his collective theorizing, posited that space and
  time are related and should be considered and calculated in
  relation to each other, and that the measurements of objects will
  be relative to the velocity of the person observing them. It is
  very empirical and observable. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, deals with particle
  behavior on an infinitely small scale and therefore cannot belong
  in Einstein’s empirically testable worldview for the simple
  reason that it is too abstract and theoretical. Though both suffer from certain inconsistencies: Einstein’s
  theory, for instance, breaks down when one imagines the middle of
  a black hole – an object in which time and space both collapse –
  the theories have been competing each other and generally hardly
  viewed as parallel. Scientists have been looking for a linking
  theory. Hyakutake’s model explains some inconsistencies between the two
  big models, furthering the research first carried out in 1997.
  Then, theoretical physicist, Juan Maldacena, catapulted ‘string
  theory’ into the spotlight providing a reliable realization of
  the holographic principle. That theory – which is widely said to explain the nature of
  everything – believes that the universe is made of tiny,
  immeasurable ‘strings’, or one-dimensional objects that vibrate
  and fluctuate, and in so doing account for the activity of all
  matter and time. The theory goes that the strings exist in nine dimensions of
  space and one of time. But because their scale is so difficult to
  measure – and yet they are believed to control everything – they
  are said to ‘project’ their activity onto a much simpler, flat
  space with no gravity whatsoever. This produced a world without gravity laws. However, it did not
  yet prove the universe is a hologram. Furthering the string theory, Hyakutake wrote two papers.  In one, he measures the internal energy of a black hole –
  specifically, the place where the hole meets the universe,
  otherwise known as the ‘event horizon’. He measures the activity
  of its visible properties (made up of visible particles) based on
  string theory and the effects of virtual particles, which at
  times appear and then disappear – many scientists even consider
  them a purely mathematical tool. In the second paper, Hyakutake and his team calculated the same
  activity at lower dimensions (without gravity involved) and the
  results matched the measurements of the first paper. The two new papers take Maldacena’s findings further by proposing
  an extra dimension. That tenth lower dimension has no gravity and
  its particles neatly line up in a set of strings oscillating in
  harmony, attached to one another – and not in chaos, which is
  what we had until now. And now, the scientists finally seem to have laid hands on
  mathematical proof that the universe can be measured according to
  both approaches – one that involves gravity and one that does
  not. If they are as identical as they seem, Maldacena himself
  predicts that we could one day use just quantum theory alone to
  explain the nature of everything in the universe. Maldacena has already voiced his excitement at Hyakutake’s
  calculations, saying that they appear to be correct. He told
  Nature that “the whole sequence of papers is very nice
  because it tests the dual [nature of the universes] in regimes
  where there are no analytic tests.” “They have numerically confirmed, perhaps for the first time,
  something we were fairly sure had to be true, but was still a
  conjecture — namely that the thermodynamics of certain black
  holes can be reproduced from a lower-dimensional universe,”
  said Leonard Susskind, a theoretical physicist at Stanford
  University, California, who was one of the first proponents of
  the theory of the universe as a hologram. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/space-evidence-universe-hologram-195/

During the hangout, Helen Caldicott, answered a variety of RT
  readers’ questions on topics, ranging from those of immediate
  importance, like the Fukushima crisis, to the prospects of
  humanity living through the nuclear age. Q:Should we all move to Africa in case TEPCO
  fails to remove the spent fuel rods?Helen Caldicott:Number one: this is an
  impossibility. There are billions of people in the Northern
  Hemisphere and what happens is that if there is a huge release of
  radiation from Fukushima by accident or by the fuel rods burning,
  or a fission reaction taking place, the radiation will circulate
  from west to east around the Northern Hemisphere, but as air
  masses at the equator, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere air
  masses do not mix, so most of the fallout in the air will occur
  in the Northern Hemisphere. And it’s a physical impossibility, of
  course, to move people to the Southern Hemisphere. Some people
  might do that, but it’s a terrible situation, because there’s
  nothing medical people can do about decontaminating people, you
  can’t decontaminate food, you can’t decontaminate the air that
  people are breathing.So we’re facing a potential catastrophe in terms of public
  health. People should know, though, that it takes a long time to
  get cancer after you’ve inhaled, breathed in or eaten radioactive
  materials, like, anytime from two to 80 years. But it is a very
  serious situation.  Q:I live in Tokyo and worry about health impact.
  When it comes to only cesium, soils here contain 100 becquerels
  per kilogram of cesium-134 and 137, and about 20 per cent of
  foods have a few becquerels per kilogram to 10 becquerels per
  kilogram. Please let me know your opinion on health impact and
  the reasons you think so.HC:First of all, parts of Tokyo are extremely
  radioactive. They’ve taken dirt from the streets, moss from the
  roofs, and dust from vacuum cleaners inside apartments. And in
  some cases there are very high measurements of cesium and
  strontium and other such elements, literally over a hundred
  elements in the fallout apart from cesium-137 and 134. People in
  Tokyo, actually, many of them, are at great risk. That’s number
  one.  Number two, it’s very difficult to know what to eat in Japan
  because you can’t taste or smell or see radioactive elements in
  your food. And each dose of radiation that you get adds to the
  risk of getting cancer. And as you eat more and more radioactive
  food, more radioactivity builds up in various organs of your
  body. There is little testing of food in Japan, the government is
  lying to you, and they are encouraging the farmers in Fukushima
  to grow their food, which is really criminal because there’s a
  hell of a lot of fallout on the ground, in Fukushima, and the
  radiation concentrates back from the soil into rice, green
  vegetables, milk, meat, and the like.They are even promoting the Fukushima food in Korea when I was
  there, and in Taiwan, but also in Tokyo and other places, also in
  markets in England, so the situation is very grim. And I think if
  I lived in Tokyo, I would move south. And I would be very, very
  careful about what I eat. I would only eat food coming from the
  south of Japan, and I wouldn’t eat any fish because they are
  pouring huge amounts of radiation into the Pacific Ocean every
  day. And you don’t know which fish are radioactive and which are
  not. Q:Chernobyl happened in 1986, with very
  radioactive rain over Europe. 40 percent of European area is now
  covered with radiation.HC:40 per cent of the food in Europe is
  radioactive. I do not buy European food or Japanese food.
  Luckily, I live in Australia, but if you live in America, you
  need not to eat Japanese or European food because you don’t know
  what food is radioactive and what is not. And medically, you
  mustn’t eat any radiation in food! And what’s more, Europe will
  remain radioactive for hundreds or thousands of years!And that’s so, too, with Fukushima. And the report of the
  national Academy of Sciences in New York about Chernobyl says
  [that] by now, about over a million people have died, not only of
  cancer and leukaemia, but from other diseases from the
  radioactive fallout, in Europe, as well as in Ukraine and Russia.
  And if you extrapolate that data to Japan, [which is] much more
  densely populated, we’re going to see a lot of cancers. Already,
  in two-and-a-half years, they’ve diagnosed, or suspectedly
  diagnosed, 44 cases of thyroid cancer, and thyroid cancer is
  extremely rare, one in a million children get thyroid cancer. So
  this indicates [that] those children and everyone else have
  received extremely high doses of radioactive iodine and lots of
  other elements, so that bodes very badly for the future, for the
  Japanese people.Q:We have learnt there were soya plants beginning
  to grow in Chernobyl. Why can’t we do genetic studies on them and
  adopt them in stable food crops to deal with radioactive exposure
  in farmlands?HC:Let me tell you there’s a wonderful scientist
  called Timothy Mousseau, who is an evolutionary biologist, who is
  going into exclusion zones, very radioactive zones around
  Chernobyl and Fukushima, to the detriment of his own health. He
  is looking at the birds and the insects, and the wildlife, plants
  in those areas, and [found], first of all, that birds he was
  looking at have smaller than normal brains because developing
  brains are very sensitive to the effects of radiation. Many of
  the male birds are sterile which means that they will die out.
  They are covered with mutations, they have crooked tails, crooked
  wings, white patches on them. Many of them have cataracts in
  their eyes.  And what happens to animals, happens to humans, because we test
  all our drugs and medicine on animals before we give them to
  humans, so what we’re seeing in the animals which reproduce very
  fast and in which we watch generations and generations, is what
  will happen in humans. There are 6,000 genetic diseases we now know of, including cystic
  fibrosis, diabetes, hemochromatosis, dwarfism, I could go on and
  on. And all of those diseases are going to increase in frequency
  down the time span because of radioactive pollution. It’s an
  absolutely wicked, wicked industry, which kills people. And the other thing you need to know is that any country that has
  a nuclear plant has a bomb factory. Nuclear reactors manufacture
  250kg, or 500lbs, of plutonium a year. Plutonium has a half-life
  of 24,400 years. It lasts for at least a quarter of a million
  years.  You only need five kilos or 10 pounds to make
  an atomic bomb. So fundamentally, if you’ve got 500lbs of
  plutonium, you need 10lbs for the bomb, you can make 50 atomic
  bombs every year. America and Japan, and South Korea, are selling
  nuclear reactors all around the world.So not only are we selling cancer and leukemia to the future
  generations, but they’re selling atomic bombs. That causes the
  proliferation of nuclear weapons and increases the threat of
  nuclear war.Q:I feel like I’m dead already, and agree that it
  is too late for me, but perhaps I can still do something good for
  my children and hopefully for grandchildren, so count on me,
  let’s clean the mess.HC:Excellent! So what I would say to you, whichever
  country you live in: you close down all your nuclear power
  plants. America’s got over a hundred operating. They must all be
  closed down. I don’t care what the laws say: laws are written to
  protect corporations, not people. And you can’t tell me the power
  of the people isn’t greater than the power of corporations – if
  you love your children and your grandchildren, take it upon
  yourself to shut down your local nuclear power plant. Q:Do you see faster progress on the construction
  of fusion reactors?HC:No, fusion reactors are a dream for the
  physicists, they haven’t been able to construct a fusion reactor,
  I think that will never happen. But as Einstein said, the answers
  to today’s problems will not be produced by the same technology
  that caused them. We’ve got to change the way we think. And what
  Einstein said - the splitting of the atom changed
  everything, all reality, save man’s mode of thinking. Thus, we
  drift towards unparalleled catastrophe. He was right so many
  years ago - why do we keep doing it? Are we really lemmings
  rushing towards the cliff of the nuclear annihilation and global
  warming? Do we have the emotional intelligence to change the way
  we think, and decide to save this beautiful planet of ours
  and probably the only life in the universe? This is a very deep,
  and spiritual, and religious question for those who are
  religious.Q:We’ve been hearing about the White House
  meetings with the Japanese and TEPCO keen to help with the
  clean-up. Is this true? Do you know and have you heard of
  it?HC:Yes, I do know that Secretary of Energy Ernest
  Moniz has just been to Japan and visited Fukushima for the first
  time. It’s taken him a long time to get there, and he was
  terribly shocked. And he said that the Department of Energy would
  help, but I know that TEPCO is about – in the next few days – to
  start removing the spent fuel rods from the cooling pool. And two
  things could happen: a rod could break and release a lot of
  radiation and the workers will have to evacuate the whole of the
  Fukushima complex. That’s terribly serious because they are there
  every day to keep things going. Or two rods could touch each
  other in this process which has been done before, and there could
  be a fission reaction and a very large release of radiation. So I
  don’t know what the plans are, they haven’t enunciated them.  Q:What would you not hesitate to eat along the
  Pacific Coast in North America?HC:I don’t think I’d eat fish along the West Coast
  of North America. I think the food is pretty safe at the moment.
  I mean, that’s a guess. You should make sure that your
  government, state and federal, are testing your food, so you know
  what’s safe and what’s not. I think at the moment it’s probably
  relatively safe, but as I said, we’re facing possible
  catastrophe. It’s going to take them 14 months to remove those
  spent fuel rods from Reactor 4 cooling pool. We’re living with
  impending catastrophe every day.Q:Nuclear is the only option if you want clear
  skies. Nuclear is big in Europe. If you don’t want nuclear, you
  must have dirty coal-powered stations, there’s no free
  choice…HC:That’s not true! If you download the study called
  ‘Carbon-Free, Nuclear-Free’ from the internet, the study
  that I commissioned and organized several years ago with a
  brilliant physicist called Arjun Makhijani, it shows that all
  energy for Europe and for America, for every country, can be now
  supplied by renewable energy.Each day renewable energy gets cheaper and cheaper; cheaper by
  far than nuclear. We mustn’t burn coal, you’re absolutely right,
  but for God’s sake, why don’t the countries of the world stop
  subsidizing nuclear, stop subsidizing fossil fuels, and cover
  every house with solar panels, solar hot water system, solar
  thermal systems like they’ve constructed in Spain, windmills?
  I’ve just been in Germany and Austria, and lots of farmhouses are
  now covered with solar panels. Germany is moving fast with
  renewables. [As for] Denmark, 40 percent of its electricity comes
  from wind.  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"1 Sep, 2013 16:20",Kerry: ‘US tests show sarin used in Syria chemical attack’,"Samples collected by first responders after the Aug. 21 chemical attack in a Damascus suburb have tested positive for the Sarin nerve agent, US Secretary of State John Kerry told US media as he sought build support for a military strike. Kerry made his comments as part of a series of nine TV
  appearances to persuade the US public opinion of the need for
  military retaliation on Syria, following Saturday’s announcement
  by Barack Obama that he will seek approval for the use of force
  in Congress.“In the last 24 hours, we have learned through samples that
  were provided to the US that have now been tested from first
  responders in east Damascus and hair samples and blood samples
  have tested positive for signatures of sarin,""Kerry said on
  NBC's Meet The Press.In a later appearance on CNN, Kerry said that the evidence, which
  was gathered independently of the UN, strengthened Obama's call
  for military action against the regime of President Bashar Assad,
  which the US accuses of being responsible for the chemical
  weapons attack.""Each day that goes by, this case is even stronger,""Kerry
  said, calling the case“overwhelming.”Sarin is a man-made chemical warfare agent, considered the most
  toxic and fast-acting of its kind. The odorless, colorless nerve
  agent interferes with an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase that
  controls nerve signals to the muscles.The US lawmakers are to return from recess on September 9. Kerry
  said he believed there are“good people in the Congress”who would support intervention.In his interviews, Kerry avoided answering the question whether
  Obama would still act if the Congress voted against strikes on
  the Syrian targets. Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC, Kerry expressed the hope
  that Russia would realize that Assad crossed the line by using
  chemical weapons against civilians, and join the US in their
  effort to hold the Syrian regime accountable.The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma,
  Aleksey Pushkov, believes that Kerry’s claims of discovered sarin
  traces doesn’t in any way prove that the chemical weapons were
  used by the Syrian government.“The traces of sarin near Damascus prove nothing. It could’ve
  been used by the militants. Like one British MP said: ‘You don’t
  have to be Einstein’ to do that,”Pushkov wrote on his
  Twitter page. Russia has been calling for a full investigation into the
  allegations surrounding the Aug. 21 attack which reportedly
  killed hundreds of people. On Saturday, Russian President
  Vladimir Putin urged Washington to present its evidence to the UN
  Security Council before beginning the attack, saying doing
  otherwise would be“a violation of international law.”Putin labeled as“utter nonsense”the idea that the Syrian
  government would use chemical weapons on its own people when UN
  inspectors were in Damascus, calling the whole affair a
  “provocation” by Syrian rebels hoping to embroil Western powers
  in the conflict.Meanwhile, the samples that UN investigators gathered at the site
  of the attack near Damascus are yet to be sent to European
  laboratories, UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said.According to Nesirky,“two Syrian officials”will be
  monitoring the testing to ensure transparency. Earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it may be two
  weeks before the final results of the analysis are ready. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/kerry-syria-evidence-congress-281/
"23 Aug, 2013 13:06",The GDP distractor,"A minor, but persistent, under bias in the inflation gauge used in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may have created a wildly distorted picture of our economic health. Albert Einstein, a man who knew a thing or two about celestial
  mechanics, supposedly once called compound interest ""the most
  powerful force in the universe."" While the remark was likely
  meant to be funny (astrophysicists can be hilarious), it sheds
  light on the often overlooked fact that small changes, over time,
  can yield enormous results. Over eons, small creeks can
  carve large canyons through solid rock. The same phenomenon may
  be at work in our economy. A minor, but persistent under bias in
  the inflation gauge used in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may
  have created a wildly distorted picture of our economic health. It would be impossible to measure the economy without ""backing
  out,"" inflation. That is why economists are very careful to
  separate GDP reports into two categories: ""nominal"" (which are
  not adjusted for inflation), and real (which are). Only the
  real reports matter. The big question then becomes, how do
  we measure inflation? Just asI
  reported last weekwith respect to the biases baked into the
  government's GDP revisions, the devil is in the details. As it turns out there are a number of official inflation gauges
  that vie for supremacy. Most people tend to follow the Consumer
  Price Index (CPI) which is compiled by Bureau of Labor
  Statistics, a division of the Department of Labor. The CPI is
  regarded as the broadest measurement tool, but it has been
  changed many times over the years. Most famously, its formulas
  were loosened in the late 1990's as a result of the ""Boskin
  Commission"" which said that the CPI overstated inflation by
  failing to account for changes in consumer behavior. I believe
  those changes seriously undermined the reliability of the index.
  But the CPI itself has to contend for relevance with its stripped
  down rival, the ""Core CPI,"" which factors out food and energy,
  which many believe are too volatile to be accurately
  counted. The core CPI is almost always lower than the
  ""headline"" number. Another set of inflation data, the ""GDP Deflator"" is compiled by
  the Bureau of Economic Analysis (part of the Commerce
  Department), and is used by them to calculate GDP. The deflator
  differs from the CPI in that it has much more flexibility in
  weighting and swapping out items that are in its sample basket of
  goods and services. While the CPI attracts the lion's share of
  the media and political attention, it is the deflator that is
  relevant when looking at economic growth.  On a quarterly basis the two numbers are usually close enough to
  escape scrutiny. (However, the most recent 2ndquarter
  GDP estimates relied on annualized inflation of a ridiculously
  low .7%!). But if you look at a broader time horizon a very
  clear pattern emerges that makes a great difference in how we
  perceive the economic landscape. Available data sets for both the CPI and the GDP deflator go back
  to 1947. That 66 year period falls neatly into two phases. From
  1947 to 1977 both yardsticks moved together almost identically,
  both rising 173% over that time. But in the ensuing 36 years
  (until 2013), the CPI is up almost three fold (292%) while the
  deflator is only up about two fold (209%). The CPI rising 40%
  more than the GDP deflator is an extremely significant factor.
  How did that happen? As it turns out, quarterly inflation
  assumptions have been, on average, .17% lower for the deflator
  than for the CPI since 1977. That is a small number. But as with
  compound interest small numbers add up to big numbers over time. Annualized the .17% difference would shave off an additional .68%
  of annual GDP growth. This is about a quarter of the average
  2.85% real growth rate since 1977 that the government has
  calculated using the deflator. Over 35 years this has likely made
  a huge difference in the how the economy actually feels and how
  we live, regardless of the nominal figures that are published.
  Even if you were to split the difference between the CPI and the
  deflator you would still get an economy that feels significantly
  smaller than it appears. The $64,000 question ($188,000 adjusted by CPI inflation since
  1977) is what happened in 1977 to make the CPI and the deflator
  diverge? Sadly, the details aren't really made public. What we do
  know is that the BEA took over the task in 1972, and that the
  separation occurred a few years later when inflation really
  started to run out of control. We also know that the deflator is
  more flexible than the CPI and that the interests of the
  government are better served by reporting low inflation and
  higher growth. So in other words, the deflator is likely
  lower for the same reasons that dogs lick themselves in intimate
  places: because they want to and they can. If we had been growing as quickly as the official GDP indicates,
  why would our labor force have contracted so significantly? Why
  are we continuously replacing middle class jobs with lower paying
  ones? Why would we be using 3 percent less energy nationally than
  we did 10 years ago despite an 8.8% growth in population? Why
  would Americans be spending a higher percentage of their
  disposable incomes on basic necessities than they were 10 years
  ago? These trends don't conform to healthy GDP growth. So maybe
  the growth is largely an illusion? When you take into consideration the likelihood that even the CPI
  drastically understates inflation, you get a much clearer picture
  of the true state of the U.S. economy. If you ever wondered how
  we went from being the world's largest creditor to its biggest
  debtor despite all this economic growth, now you know. As the
  growth was merely a statistical illusion, we have been forced to
  borrow money to maintain a life style our economy can no longer
  support. So the next time you see a GDP report remind yourself that the
  ""deflator"" should really be called the ""distractor."" It's there
  to distract you from the truth. Peter Schiff is the CEO and Chief

"23 Jul, 2013 19:06",NASA starts building faster-than-light warp engine,"Researchers at NASA’s Texas-based Johnson Space Center are trying to prove that it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light, and hope to one day build an engine that resembles the fictional Starship Enterprise. NASA physicist and engineer Dr. Harold G. White, 43, believes it
  is possible to bend the rules of time and space that Albert
  Einstein constructed when he postulated that it is impossible to
  exceed the speed of light. White's research is based on the theories of Mexican physicist
  Miguel Alcubierre, who in 1994 theorized that exceeding
  Einstein’s galactic speed limit was possible if scientists
  discovered a way to harness the expansion and contraction of
  space. And Harold and his team are trying to do just that.  By creating a “warp bubble” that expands space on one side of a
  spaceship and contracts it on the other,“the spaceship will
  be pushed away from the Earth and pulled towards a distant star
  by space-time itself,”Dr. Alcubierre wrote in his
  hypothesis. Dr. White is trying to warp the trajectory of a photon to see if
  he can propel its travel at faster-than-light speeds.  His
  laboratory floats above a system of underground pneumatic piers
  and was constructed in a way that it would be free from seismic
  disturbances, since his team’s measuring devices can pick up the
  smallest vibrations – even those created from people who are
  walking nearby. Dr. White told the New York Times that since nature can travel at
  warp speeds, there is a chance that humans can figure out how to
  do it too. “Space has been expanding since the Big Bang 13.7 billion
  years ago,”Dr. White told the Times.“And we know that
  when you look at some of the cosmology models, there were early
  periods of the universe where there was explosive inflation,
  where two points would’ve went receding away from each other at
  very rapid speeds.”  Although Dr. White believes the potential construction of a
  spaceship like the USS Enterprise lies in the distant future,
  such a project could open doors for far-reaching space travel.
  Developing a warp drive would allow NASA to drastically reduce
  travel times to other star systems from tens of thousands of
  years to weeks or months. With such technology, astronauts could
  take quick trips to explore other solar systems. Edwin F. Taylor, a former editor of The American Journal of
  Physics and senior research scientist at MIT, told the Times that“the idea is crazy for now.” “[But] check with me in a hundred years,”he added,
  thereby noting that constructing such a spacecraft might lie in
  the realm of possibilities. Richard Obousy, a physicist and president of Icarus Interstellar,
  said the idea“is not air-fairy, pie in the sky.”“We tend to overestimate what we can do on short time scales,
  but I think we massively underestimate what we can do on longer
  time scales,”he said of Dr. White’s work. But Dr. Alcubierre, who has never met Dr. White, said that a
  major hurdle is the fact that a warp bubble“cannot be reached
  by any signal from within the ship”and can’t be turned on or
  off in the first place. Despite the odds, Dr. White and his team are continuing their
  research, and believe that they can bring warp speed into the
  realm of the possible.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/nasa-warp-engine-light-488/
"14 Jun, 2013 09:54",US firms in bed with intelligence agencies in info swap - report,"Thousands of US tech, finance, and manufacturing firms have secret agreements with national security agencies to trade sensitive information in return for classified intelligence, Bloomberg’s sources revealed. The firms involved are referred to as ‘trusted partners’ by US
  intelligence organizations such as the National Security Agency
  (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of
  Investigation (FBI) and branches of US military. In fact, thousands of US companies voluntarily provide US
  agencies with data (i.e. equipment specifications), Bloomberg’s
  four sources, who either worked for the government or in
  companies that have these agreements, said. And the information
  received can be used to gain access to computers of America’s
  rivals. Cooperation between companies and intelligence agencies is legal,
  reported Bloomberg. And the fact that the companies provide
  information voluntarily means there is no need for US agencies to
  get court orders and no oversight is required under the Foreign
  Intelligence Surveillance Act, one out of four sources said. Also, some of the companies’ executives are guaranteed immunity
  from civil actions related to transfer of information. For example, Microsoft passes on information about bugs in its
  software before it publicly releases a fix to the problem, two
  sources confirmed. This kind of information can protect US
  government computers, as well as help to infiltrate those used by
  foreign governments by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
  Microsoft’s system. Microsoft is reportedly not told how the US government uses the
  information passed on down to it, according to one official.
  Spokesman for Microsoft Frank Shaw confirmed such releases and
  stated that they give the government a chance to get“an early
  start: on risk assessment and mitigation.”  McAfee, America’s global computer security software company, is
  another ‘trusted partner’ and is known for its cooperation with
  the NSA, CIA, and FBI. It can share valuable data including
  malicious internet traffic, one of the sources said. The company’s worldwide chief technology officer, Michael Fey,
  rebuffed the claim that the company does not share any personal
  information with the government. “McAfee’s function is to provide security technology,
  education, and threat intelligence to governments … [including]
  emerging new threats, cyber-attack patterns and hacker group
  activity,”he stated. Due to the sensitivity of information being traded, these kinds
  of agreements are usually made strictly between companies’ chief
  executive officers and heads of the US agencies. At times the
  chief executives could clear a few trusted people to work
  directly with the agencies. In return for their cooperation, companies are showered with
  attention and gratitude. “If I were the director and had a relationship with a company
  who was doing things that were not just directed by law, but were
  also valuable to the defense of the Republic, I would go out of
  my way to thank them and give them a sense as to why this is
  necessary and useful”,Michael Hayden, former director of the
  NSA and the CIA said. One of the sources said that public would be surprised how much
  help the government is seeking in terms of collecting
  information. Reportedly, it is currently implementing a new
  expensive program called Einstein 3. The program was developed by
  the NSA to protect the government from hackers by analyzing
  billions of emails being sent to the government computers. Five of America’s major internet companies, including AT&T
  and Verizon, have agreed to install the program on their servers
  and have received immunity guarantees, which specify that they
  would not be held liable under US wiretap laws, one of the
  sources revealed. In the past companies like AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth were
  already reportedly involved foreavesdroppingon behalf of the NSA. In 2006 sources
  revealed that the companies collected call records of tens of
  millions of Americans and shared them with NSA. US companies are willing to participate in these kinds of
  agreement because they either believe they are helping to protect
  the nation and/or helping to advance their own interests by
  receiving classified information in return, sources said. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin, for example, was given sensitive
  government information a year into its data sharing agreement
  with NSA. The info provided linked the 2010 attack on Google to a
  specific unit within the Chinese military – the People’s
  Liberation Army – one of the sources confirmed. Brin was even
  given a classified clearance to attend a secret briefing on the
  subject. Google was reportedly one of the participants in the secret NSA
  PRISM program that was revealed by ex-CIA staffer and
  whistleblower EdwardSnowden. The program uses data mining
  surveillance to access emails, videos, chats, photos and search
  queries from nine worldwide tech giants. Snowden also disclosed a secret NSA program called Blarney, which
  gathers metadata on computers and devices that send emails or
  browse the Internet through principal data routes, known as a
  backbone. The whistleblower was last seen Monday, checking out of his hotel
  in Hong Kong, where he stayed for three weeks after leaving the
  US.  Snowden is hoping that by staying in Hong Kong would help him
  avoid any extradition attempts on behalf of the US.  In
  terms of the US-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, both Hong Kong and
  Beijing have the power to stymie Snowden’s extradition. China for
  its part has no extradition treaty with the United States. China has thus far refrained from making statements on the
  Snowden case. But a popular Chinese Communist Party-backed
  newspaper has printed an article demonstrating the benefits of
  not sending Snowden back to US, arguing that his knowledge of US
  surveillance programs are key to China’s national interest. The article comes after Snowden resurfaced and gave an exclusive
  interview to the South China Morning Post, revealing top-secret
  US government records that show dates and IP addresses of
  computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland that were hacked by
  the NSA over a four-year period. In the meantime, the FBI has launched an investigation into
  Snowden leaking US top secret surveillance tactics and has
  promised to hold the whistleblower accountable. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/us-firms-trade-information-684/
"23 May, 2013 16:21",Medical first: Doctors save boy by 3-D printing airway tube,"US doctors are celebrating a scientific breakthrough that may have saved the life of a baby boy. For the first time in medical history, doctors have created an
airway splint with a 3-D laser print, which was implanted into a
boy whose airway kept collapsing. Kaiba Gionfriddo, a 19-month-old
boy who was 3 months old when he had the operation done, was
suffering from a birth defect that caused his airway to collapse
nearly every day. During each incident, the baby would stop
breathing, his face would turn blue, and his heart would
occasionally stop. Doctors believed it was only a matter of time
before the collapse of his airway would be fatal. “Quite a few doctors said he had a good chance of not leaving
the hospital alive,”April Gionfriddo, the boy’s mother, told
the University of Michigan Health System for its news release on
the procedure.“At that point, we were desperate. Anything that
would work, we would take it and run with it.” With no time to lose, doctors at the University of Michigan (UM)
immediately began an attempt to build an artificial airway splint.
Biomedical researchers at the university had recently obtained a
new, bioresorbable device that they believed could help the boy. In
just one day, they used computer-controlled lasers to print out 100
tiny plastic tubes that they stacked and fused together. The
following day, the doctors implanted one of the tubes they made
into Kaiba’s airway – a procedure that had never before been
done. The Food and Drug Administration approved the procedure
beforehand, despite the lack of information about the effects of
this process. But immediately after the tube was inserted, the baby
boy was able to breathe normally. “It was amazing. As soon as the splint was put in, the lungs
started going up and down for the first time and we knew he was
going to be OK,”said Dr. Glenn Green, a pediatric specialist
who led the procedure at the UM C.S. Moss Children’s Hospital, in a
university press release. And after 19 months, the boy has not had a single problem with
his airway, and Green told AP that“he’s a pretty healthy kid
right now.” Prior to the boy’s procedure, doctors have only ever conducted
trachea or windpipe transplants using body parts from deceased
donors. Occasionally, the parts were lab-produced using stem cells.
But because Kaiba had an incompletely formed bronchus, those types
of procedures were not suitable to treat his condition. Most
children who are born with bronchus birth defects outgrow the
condition by age 2 or 3. The plastic used for Kaiba's airway splint
degrades over time and is gradually absorbed by the body, allowing
the healthy tissue to replace it. About 2,200 babies are born in the US each year with the
condition known as tracheobronchomalaci, but few are as serious as
Kaiba’s. The new technology could potentially help thousands of
children breathe normally until healthy body tissue replaces the
defect. “I can think of a handful of children I have seen in the last
two decades who suffered greatly… that likely would have benefited
from this technology,”Dr. John Bent, a pediatric specialist at
New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine, told AP. Scott Hollister, Ph.D., a professor of biomedical engineering at
UM, said that his involvement in the procedure is the highlight of
his career. “To actually build something that a surgeon can use to save a
person’s life? It’s a tremendous feeling,”he said in UM’s news
release. Green, the doctor who led the procedure, believes that Kaiba
would most likely be dead if it wasn’t for the implanted airway
splint. “He was imminently going to die,”Green said.“…I’ve
seen children die from it. To see this device work, it’s a major
accomplishment and offers hope for these children.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/gionfriddo-kaiba-airway-printing-700/
"14 Mar, 2013 20:49",‘God particle’ confirmed: CERN says data ‘strongly indicates’ Higgs boson found,"It is now almost certain the subatomic particle that brings together everything in the universe has been found, CERN scientists announced on Thursday. Latest analysis of data from the Large Hadron Collider proves that the Higgs boson actually exists. The search for the missing particle dubbed as ‘the holy grail of
physics,’ which has been going on for almost half a century and has
brought the $10 billion Large Hadron Collider (LHC) into existence,
has finally resulted in some strong experimental evidence. For the first time since the triumphant announcement of the new
particle discovery in July 2012, the European Organization for
Nuclear Research CERN has declared it is indeed the Higgs boson
that they’ve found, as the analyzed LHC data “strongly
indicates.” “The preliminary results with the full 2012 data set are
magnificent and to me it is clear that we are dealing with a Higgs
boson, though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of
Higgs boson it is,”said physicist Joe Incandela, the
spokesperson for CERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) team.  The existence of the boson in question and its linked energy
field was predicted by British physicist Peter Higgs as he was
looking for answers of the open questions of particle physics.
Without the Higgs boson, the Standard Model of particle physics
fails to explain all the processes happening in the universe, its
absence would also not be compatible with Einstein’s theory of
general relativity – still a dominant way of explaining
gravity. The question which has eluded countless physicists for decades,
and the missing link explaining how the universe works at the very
basic level, is what gives mass to matter. In other words, what has
brings all the flying particles together to form stars, planets and
humans ever since the Big Bang. Many scientists attribute this role to the elusive Higgs boson,
although “exotic” theories exist, which go beyond the Standard
Model. Now, after petabytes of LHC data have been processed, CERN
scientists are quite confident there is a Higgs boson – and that it
most likely fits into the mainstream particle physics principles,
as David Charlton of the LHC’s ATLAS team indicated during the
Thursday CERN conference. Although it might take years for the discovery to be fully
confirmed and fleshed out, one cannot expect anything more
sensational from the LHC team in the coming two years, as the
27-kilometer collider has been shut down for maintenance until the
early 2015.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/higgs-boson-found-confirmed-274/
"16 Jan, 2013 17:00",‘Holding further peace talks with Israel is insane’ – former Palestinian negotiator,"Palestinian leaders wasted 20 years on fruitless negotiations with Israel, and now need a foreign power to manage the peace process, Dr. Diana Butto told RT. Dr. Butto is a Palestinian human rights lawyer and former peace negotiations adviser. Neither Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas nor Hamas – both of whom are simply clinging to power – have the qualities so desperately needed by the Palestinians to unify the nation, Butto explained. However, Israel is embroiled in an even deeper political crisisRT: A UN bid gave Palestinians upgraded status. President Mahmoud Abbas said that the [UN] vote was a turning point – but was it? Have the rules of the game changed?Diana Butto: Not at all. One of the problems with the upgrading of the status is that it was done for symbolic reasons, and not really for anything like legal reasons. I wish that it could be a turning point. In other words, I wish that Mahmoud Abbas would abandon the strategy of (endless) negotiations and instead start moving towards a legal strategy of trying to hold Israel accountable or trying to get the world’s support. But he is not doing that. Instead, my fear is that this was a largely symbolic move designed to boost his own popularity, a popularity that's been dropping. But it really is not going to change anything on the ground other than the signs.RT: But if anything, could it have backfired? Because since that announcement there have been at least 5,000 settlement units that have been announced by the Israeli government.DB: The Israelis would have built these settlements with or without [Palestine’s] UN status. The settlements are the one feature that have existed in this place since 1967. Pretty much within two weeks of the start of Israeli occupation in June 1967 settlements began, and there has never really been a stop in settlement construction.The Israelis are always looking for an excuse, and pointing to an excuse, but they're  never really serious about it. It's always just a question of building and expanding settlements because they can, nobody’s holding them accountable.So going back to the UN vote, I wish that [Abbas] would use this opportunity to change the rules of the game, to sign on to the International Criminal Court and to start holding Israel accountable for this settlement construction and expansion. These are war crimes.I wish he would also go and declare [Israeli policy] apartheid, just the same way as other South African leaders declared this apartheid.RT:Why doesn’t he?DB: In large part because he is heavily dependent on foreign aid. More than 70 percent of the day-to-day Palestinian economy comes through assistance from foreign donors. And I think that he is afraid that there will be repercussions if he goes down that path.The problem is that [Abbas] is simply nonconfrontational. He really does not want to go down this path and actually bear the brunt of continuing to push forward against Israel’s illegal activity.RT: Is there almost a crisis in the Palestinian leadership? You’re talking about the shortcomings of Abbas, but it is no secret that there is a huge rivalry between Hamas and Fatah. There is no unified leadership on that front either.DB: We have had a crisis of leadership for a very long period of time – and so have the Israelis. On the Palestinian side the crisis of leadership is that we do not have a leader who is willing to really stand up and try to unite Palestinians together, try to push for and end Israeli military occupation, try to bring together and embolden Palestinians, give them something to push for. Instead, we’ve seen a leadership that is more interested in remaining in power. Both the leadership on the West Bank stays in power without elections, the leadership in the Gaza Strip – their term has expired long ago.In terms of the Palestinians there is a crisis of leadership, but there is a bigger crisis of leadership among the Israelis. We have an Israeli Prime Minister who goes to extreme lengths to continue to build and expand Israeli settlements, who does not want to confront the settler movement, who simply wants Israel to head down the path of war and is willing to go to extreme lengths to get himself reelected, including attacking Gaza.RT: If we go back to the PA’s UN bid, the Israeli point is that it was a unilateral move that should not have been undertaken. Instead, Israelis and Palestinians should rather sit around the negotiation table. One of the Israeli spokespeople said “you cannot make peace without actually recognizing your partner.” So, why haven’t the Palestinians come forward to the negotiation table?DB: Well, let’s talk about unilateral measures. The first unilateral measure was taken by Israel and continues to be taken by Israel: Building and expanding the illegal settlements. They have never consulted the Palestinians and said “we want to build here, we want to build there.” They're all illegal under international law.In terms of unilateralism – it has always been the Israelis pushing forward on the question of unilateralism. It's for that very reason Palestinian negotiators are not sitting down with the Israelis, because you cannot continue to sit down and negotiate with the Israelis while at the same time they are eating over the very land you’re supposed to be negotiating – that does not make sense.What does make sense  is to begin to put into place measures to hold Israel accountable. It’s important to keep in mind that it is Israel occupying the Palestinians, not the other way around. And it will be Israel that has to end its occupation, not the other way around.So, for us to move forward, now is the time that we have to see concrete international measures to hold Israel accountable.RT: Do you think that negotiations can still work between Israelis and Palestinians? DB: Absolutely not. I was a part of the negotiating team for a period of five years, and the negotiations failed during that period of time. They failed before I was there and they failed after I left as well.They failed for a number of reasons, but primarily because we had two very unequal parties, Israel being the more powerful party and the Palestinians being the weaker party. At the same time, while the negotiations were conducted, Israel as the more powerful party had the ability to change the rules of the game, to build and expand more Israeli settlements.Sitting at the negotiation table, it was always a question of power. And without another party to balance that imbalance of power, negotiations will always fail.RT: What is the alternative? Can it always be unilateral moves?DB: I think the alternative is to make it a much more international issue by beginning to bring other countries around the world to hold Israel accountable. Whether that is through sanctions or individuals boycotting Israel, through divestment or Israel’s isolation.It is no longer going to be a case where weak Palestinians stand up against a very strong nuclear power – Israel – and to expect that the occupation is somehow going to end somehow.RT: We’ve heard from the Palestinian leadership that they are planning to launch another initiative for a new negotiation with the Israelis. It does not seem that they have completely given up on negotiations.DB: The definition of insanity, I believe Albert Einstein said this, is to do things over and over again and expect a different result. Palestinians have been negotiating with the Israelis now for 20 years. I’m not sure that this meets the definition of insanity, but it is pretty close, the idea of going back to negotiations when we’ve seen what the outcome has been in the past. To me it seems futile.I think instead the [Palestinian] leadership should start empowering Palestinians, it should start pushing forward for a non-power resistance, for boycotts, pushing the world to sanction and isolate Israel. This is the type of leadership the Palestinians need and these are the steps that will work.RT: You’re a former advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Did you quit because of the failure at the last negotiations?DB: Absolutely. I went through a very deep crisis of faith, when I began to see that the only strategy adopted for negotiations, in the face of really countless announcements of settlement expansions, Israel’s construction of the wall, and the only position that the  Palestinian Authority continued to adopt was to go back to more and more negotiations  without any vision, without any sort of idea of what would happen if those negotiation failed. I could not be a part of this process any longer.RT: Would the terms for peace be different now than they were when you were negotiating for peace back in 2005?DB: They are precisely the same. One of the problems that we faced during negotiations was that Israel was unwilling to recognize the applicability of international law. Meaning that all of the territory that it occupied in 1967 does not belong to Israel, the world has said this and continues to repeat this every year. And yet every step of the way, Israel wanted to build and expands settlements to be able to take more and more Palestinian land in order to change the boundaries and the borders. If there is a real commitment to peace on the part of Israel, it should recognize that it has to be part of the international community. And being a part of the international community means abiding by international law. Israel cannot be above the law and Palestinians cannot be beneath it. The terms have not changed at all.What has changed is that over the course of the past 45 years there has now been cemented in the mindset among Israeli settlers that this land is theirs. And the reason that this mindset was cemented is nobody has actually challenged the Israeli settler movement to force them to get out.Rather than forcing them out, the [Israeli] government provides them with incentives to move in. That’s where the problem lies.RT:If you would be advising President Abbas today, what advice would you give him?DB: The first thing I would say: Move away from moves that are largely symbolic and start focusing on holding Israel accountable. I would encourage him to sign up to the International Criminal Code right away to start pressing for the crime of Israeli apartheid to be challenged. To be pushing for Israel’s isolation due to the fact that it has been building and expanding settlements.I would also be advising him to empower the Palestinians to go out and protest non-violently. And that he would be at the helm, he would be leading the way, not just sitting in a very fancy office across the street from where we're sitting right now.I would advise him as well that he should be pushing the international community to be isolating Israel. And that he shouldalways at the same time be speaking very clearly at all times on Israel’s illegal activities, and to reinstate the Palestinians’ rights.RT:Do you think there is a real chance for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians?DB: In the short-term? No. I’m very pessimistic in the short-term, but optimistic in the long-term. I’m pessimistic because I see that things are not going to change, but in the long-term I  feel that this is not going to be sustainable.

"28 Dec, 2012 16:19",Oliver Stone to RT: ‘US has become an Orwellian state’,"Americans are living in an Orwellian state argue Academy Award-winning director Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick, as they sit down with RT to discuss US foreign policy and the Obama administration’s disregard for the rule of law. Both argue that Obama is a wolf in sheep’s clothing and that people have forgiven him a lot because of the “nightmare of the Bush presidency that preceded him.” “He has taken all the Bush changes he basically put them into the establishment, he has codified them,” Stone told RT. “It is an Orwellian state. It might not be oppressive on the surface, but there is no place to hide. Some part of you is going to end up in the database somewhere.”According to Kuznick, American citizens live in a fish tank where their government intercepts more than 1.7 billion messages a day. “That is email, telephone calls, other forms of communication.” RT’s Abby Martin in the program Breaking the Set discusses the Showtime film series and book titled The Untold History of the United States co-authored by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick. ""Obama was a great hope for change"" RT: It took both of you almost five years to produce this series. And in it you have a chapter called Obama: Management of a Wounded Empire. You give a harsh critique of the Obama administration. What in your eyes has been the most troubling aspect of his presidency, Oliver?Oliver Stone: I think under the disguise of sheep’s clothing he has been a wolf. That because of the nightmare of the Bush presidency that preceded him, people forgave him a lot. He was a great hope for change. The color of his skin, the upbringing, the internationalism, the globalism, seemed all evident. And he is an intelligent man. He has taken all the Bush changes he basically put them into the establishment, he has codified them. That is what is sad. So we are going into the second administration that is living outside the law and does not respect the law and foundations of our system and he is a constitutional lawyer, you know. Without the law, it is the law of the jungle.  Nuremburg existed for a reason and there was a reason to have trials, there is a reason for due process – ‘habeas corpus’ as they call it in the United States. RT: Do you agree Peter?Peter Kuznick: I agree, if you look at his domestic policy, he did not break with the Bush administration’s policies. If you look at his transparency – he claimed to be the transparency president when he was running for office. There has not been transparency. We have been actually classifying more documents under Obama than we did under Bush. All previous presidents between 1970 and 2008 indicted three people total under Espionage Act. Obama has already indicted six people under the Espionage Act. The surveillance has not stopped, the incarceration without bringing people to trial has not stopped. So those policies have continued. Then there are war policies, militarization policies. We are maintaining that. We are fighting wars now in Yemen, Afghanistan, we are keeping troops in Afghanistan. We have not cut back the things that we all found so odious about the Bush administration and Obama added some of his own. The drones policy – Obama had more drone attack in the first eight months than Bush had his entire presidency. And these have very dubious international legality.   OS: Peter was hopeful that the in the second term there will be some more flexibility, we hope so. But, there is a system in place, which is enormous – the Pentagon system. RT: It almost seems that they took the odious CIA policies and just branded them, so it is now acceptable – the assassinations, the extrajudicial executioner without the due process. It is fascinating. ""We are all ultimately watching ourselves"" PK: We complained during Bush years that Bush was actually conducting surveillance without judiciary review. Obama is killing people, targeted assassinations without judiciary review. That to us is obviously much more serious. RT: You also cover Pearl Harbor, which of course led to the internment of Japanese American citizens. I do not think a lot of people acknowledge that once again underreported aspect of really what that meant. When you look at the surveillance grid in America today it almost seems like it is an open-air internment camp, where they do not need to intern people anymore because we have this grid set up in place. What do you guys think about that?PK: The US government now intercepts more than 1.7 billion messages a day from American citizens. That is email, telephone calls, other forms of communication. Can you imagine: 1.7 billion? We’ve got this apparatus set up now with hundreds of thousands of people, over a million of people with top security clearances in this kind of nightmarish state, this 1984 kind of state. OS: One million top security clearances. That is a pretty heavy number. In other words, we are living in a fish pond and I think the sad part is that the younger people accept that. They are used to the invasion. And that is true, how can we follow the lives of everybody? But the truth is that we are all ultimately watching ourselves. It is an Orwellian state. It might not be oppressive on the surface, but there is no place to hide. Some part of you is going to end up in the database somewhere. ""US fears things,we fear the rest of the world"" PK: And it can be oppressive on the surface. One of the things we feared after 9/11 was that if there was a second serious attack like 9/11 then the constitution would be gone. The crackdown would be so outrageous at that point. And there is still this obsessive fear. The US fears things, we fear the rest of the world. We spend as much money on our military security intelligence as the rest of the world combined. Do we have enemies that we feel so threatened by? Do we really need this anymore? Is this what our priorities should be? No we think not, we want to turn that around.RT: The evisceration of the rule of law, especially the National Defense Authorization Act, which eradicates due process – our basic fundamental freedom in this country. I wanted to bring up another interesting point that really struck me in the film series, which are the kamikaze pilots. They were brave, that was the bravest act that you could do and then I can’t help but think of suicide bombers today and Bill Maher, he goes out and loses his show for saying these people are brave. And you have people like Ron Paul get up there and talk about blowback as a reality and he is ridiculed. How did we get here, where the discourse is just so tongued down when we can’t even acknowledge the truths such as that?OS: Primitive of course. There has been a blind worship of the military and patriotism. I strongly believe in the strong military, but to defend our country, not to invade other countries and to conquer the world. I think there is a huge difference that has been forgotten: morality. Once you take the laws away, as Einstein once said famously, the country does not obey its laws, the laws would be disrespected. So it seems that the fundamental morality has been lost on us somewhere on the way recently and now it is what is effective. Can we kill Bin Laden without having to bring him to trial, can we just get it done? And that ‘get it down’ mentality justifies the ends and that is where countries go wrong, and people go wrong. All of our lives are moral equations. Does the end justify the means? No, it never did. PK: And the other side of what you are asking is about the constraints upon political discourse in this country. Why are people so uninformed? That is what we are to deal with in the series. If people don’t understand their history, then they don’t have any vision of the future and what is possible. If they think what exists now – the tyranny of now – is all that is possible, then they can’t dream about the future. They can’t imagine the future that is different from the present. That is what I am saying – people have to understand the past because if you study the past then you can envision a future that is very different. We came really close on many occasions to going into very different direction in the future. We came very close in 1944-1945 to avoiding atomic bombing and potentially not having the kind of Cold War that we had. We came very close in 1953 upon Stalin’s death to ending the Cold War. We came close in 1963 when Kennedy was assassinated to ending the war in Vietnam, to ending the Cold War, to heading into a very different direction. Then there were the Carter years, again a possibility of a different direction. And at the end of the Cold War in 1989 Gorbachev was reaching out to Bush. Did Bush take that olive branch that Gorbachev was giving him? No, very much different. What did we do instead? We applaud the Soviets for not invading when countries were liberating themselves from the Soviet Union and then we immediately go and invade Panama and then we invade Iraq. So we are saying that “it is great that you are showing restraint, but we are not going to because we are the hegemon.” As Madeline Albright, Secretary of State under {Bill] Clinton, says “if the US uses force it’s because we are the United States of America; we are the indispensable nation. We see further and stand taller than other nations.” That is the attitude that Oliver and I are challenging. This sense of American exceptionalism that the US is a city on the hill, God’s gift to humanity, if we do it, it is right. And that is not acceptable. ""We want the country to begin thinking about the big questions again"" OS: It is very funny because the book has been out a few weeks, series have been playing for the fifth week now. We go to TV shows, we sit in these beautiful sets and they are always rushing and rushing. They got news in Gaza, they got Obama. And they ask us what are you talking about? History? What does it have to do with today? What is your point? We sit there very patiently and it is very bizarre to me that they say the past is prologue, that is all happened before and if we are smart you will see it more calmly and won’t overreact. We also argue that this kind of media is driven by dollars, the greed. You have a show and it is really not a news show, it is about rating and how you can get that – with a lot of speed, a lot of zoom and a lot of fancy sets and people watch. Goal is to keep it moving, don’t think, just keep it moving.PK: A show like this, we can actually discuss the issues at a little more depth, a little more critically. RT: If both of you are to make a film about this generation right now, what is one facet that you think is the most underreported or misrepresented?OS: I don’t know about the younger generation, I have three children. I think it is an eternal story in some degree. People no matter what have a similar morality and consciousness, patterns re-emerge again and again. The young men and young women want to make their way into the world. And it is not that far off from what we went through. So I believe in cyclical history and I think my children are going through what I and my father and mother went through. I always look for those patterns first beyond the superficiality.PK: I find that my students care very passionately about what is going on in the world. They are all doing lots of volunteer work. But what I find in this generation, like Oliver’s and my generation, is that they treat the symptoms. They are not asking the questions about the root cause of all of these problems. They care, they try to change things, but it is more superficial. What we are challenging them to do is look at the patterns. Look at what has happened from the 1890s all the way through to today. Look at the consistency of the wars, interventions, the military expenditures, the paranoia, they fear of outsiders, the oppression. And get it to the root, what is making the system as a whole sick in a certain ways and how can we root out those deeper causes. Now that we understand that, we can begin to change that. The Occupy movement did some of that there have been times in the 1930s, 1970-80s, 1960s when people were challenging on that scale. We want the country to begin thinking about these big questions again. What is our past, how did we get here, what are the possibilities for the future, what have we done wrong and what can we get right?RT: Do you think these superficialities in the conventional wisdom that we hear are perpetuated to keep us in a perpetual state of war? PK: I don’t know if it is quite so deliberate, but that seems to be the effect – dumbing down the population to the point where they cannot think critically and then you can pull anything over their eyes. They have a five-minute attention span and a five-minute memory of what happened in the past. We are saying learn your history, study it and think about what the alternatives are, think in utopian ways how different the world could be, how better it could be if we start to organize it rationally in the interest of people, not in the interest of profit, not in the interest of Wall Street, not in the interest of military, in the interest of our common humanity, the six billion of us who occupy this planet. OS: The model of the series of The World at War, which was made by the BBC in the 1970s about WWII. Ours are 10 feature films, cut with care, an hour each, pure narration, music, and sometimes clips of films that make our point or don’t make our point. Either way we try to keep it flowing like a young person could enjoy it like a movie, I am glad you did. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"13 Oct, 2012 08:17",‘Europe can be strong without euro’,"Uniting nations under a single currency is a bad idea, Austrian billionaire-turned-politician Frank Stronach told RT. The eurozone's single currency is crippling the EU, and Stronach aims to demonstrate to the world that it can live without the euro. RT: Tell us a little bit more about this political party that you’ve established.Frank Stronach: Well, the first of all my friends say ‘Frank, are you crazy, being at 80 years old?’ Yeah! But nevertheless I’ve reached the certain age, I’m well-to-do. I don’t need anything from anyone. I just want to serve. I was born in Austria. So I have roots here. I want to serve the Austrian people, to bring a better system to the Austrian people for a better future.RT: You’ve been described as something of a euro-skeptic. Is that fair?FS: The problem we have in Europe now is, besides our own overhead let’s say, and I’m speaking now of Austria – overhead is enormous, the government overhead, now we have additional European overhead. And so it’d be very difficult to make a competitive product at a competitive price. RT: If you are elected, would you pull Austria out of the single currency?FS: No, in the overall, I’m for a strong Europe. I think especially older people are aware that there were a lot of wars, and people are afraid of that. So basically, a strong European Union could may be sure to preserve peace better, but what I think what’s wrong is to have the same common currency. Because that just doesn’t work. For the simple reason, the primary reason why people get up in the morning is they want to make a better life for themselves and their families. If they’d be bad for the system, but they recognize that importance and they pay accordingly to it, that’s what drives the whole system. In Europe you have too many people which want to distribute wealth. First, we’ve got to realize, we’ve got to think about it: How can we create wealth? Only when you create wealth can you distribute it.RT: Now, obviously, you’ve been very successful in business over the years. But we are talking about running a country here. Do you think the two can be done in the same manner?FS: Many things are similar and a country actually has got an advantage. In business, if there’s management, if you would lose for few years in a row, the shareholders will dismiss the management. In the country, for instance you take the governments of Austria, which have been ruled by two parties for the last 50 years, they lose money every year. But they have an ingenious structure, where by very little democracy, they are reelected every year. RT: Now, over 50 percent of the jobs in Austria are based on exports. If the country was to come out of the eurozone, those jobs would be at risk, wouldn’t they?FS: No, I think it would be the other way around. First of all, I said we should look at every structure, because, in the final analysis, in everything what I do would mean is it good for the people. There’s a number of ways we can do that. One – we could go back to the shilling. Two – we could let each country keep their own euro. For instance, Greece would have their own euro, Spain would have their own euro, Italy would have Italian euro, Germany, let’s say, would be [a euro] on 100 percent. Maybe Austria 200 percent. Greece might be, if there is a changeable currency, Greece may be would start out may be at 40 cents of the euro. Mabe Italy at 70 cents, Spain at 60 cents. That allows that each country then can take measurements and see how competitive they could be.RT: But isn’t what you are suggesting essentially the creation of a premier league within the single currency with likes of Austria, Germany, and France? And the rest of the currencies are left to their own devices?FS: No, it wouldn’t be. They could determine their own destiny a lot better. Because the great problem was for me, and understandable, that nowhere banks could see that the European Union is coming together, they thought ‘Those are great investments’. So they invested heavily in Greece. When they could see that the Greek people don’t really change. They have lived for thousands of years like that and they will live for next thousand of years that way. They could see that their investment was a failure. Then they ran to various countries and said ‘look, we need help.’ Because they said ‘Look, if we don’t get help, the banks will collapse’. So the Greek people, actually, get very little of that. The banks cashed in on that money. And that’s unfair. To me, it was not understandable that European countries, especially Germany, told the Greek people how to live. No countries have got the right to say ‘This is the way you should live.’ Let them decide how to live. RT: The Austrian elections have to be held by September of next year. Realistically, what do you think of your chances?FS: Well, I’ve been very successful, any time I undertake something, I usually end up number-one. So when I go in this something, I say ‘Look, I’m going to put a lot of effort in, I’m going to work hard, take this very seriously.’ And I think as long as there’s a chance to communicate with the people, because the people know that I want to serve the country, that there’s nothing for me and they know I have a lot of common sense. And the problem now with most politicians – they never got paid wages, they never got little dirt under their fingernails and they don’t know how the economy works. RT: Are you hoping to pick up votes from those members of the electorate who are upset due to the corruption scandals we’ve seen in the Austrian politics in recent times?FS: I think there’re many politicians coming to us and we tell them ‘Look, those are principles. And when you commit to the principles, the principles are based on truth, transparency and fairness’. So we would have ethics, rules connected to that – then, fine. Because everybody can make some mistakes, right? A lot of politicians sometimes are full of idealism. Naturally, if someone has been in there for many, many years. Einstein defined insanity as when you do always the same thing and you expect different results. So politicians like that – that’d be difficult for us to absorb them. But there is lot of younger politicians. They recognize that they would like our principles, so they are welcome.RT: So would you be putting yourself forward as a transitional leader who is looking to bring about the next generation of Austrian politics?FS: I made it absolutely clear that I would not be – in Austria we call it Bundes chancellor – that I would not be a Bundes chancellor, because then they’d expect you to work 24 hours a day to be available for the people. That I won’t do. I’ve worked a lot in my life. But I will closely watch the principles, and if anyone infringe on the principles, those would be put out from the body.RT: How would you see Austria’s position on the international stage changing?FS: Austria has committed to neutrality. And I think Austria, especially if we will run a great government, if we could improve the living standards of Austrians, then Austria could be a guiding light for the rest of the world – how things could be done. That’s my hope.RT: But you’ll still pull the country out of the euro?FS: Common currency just doesn’t work. I’m not saying one country is better than the other one. But we have to see these people there with certain customs and behavior. Let’s just take the Greeks. They have been fine for thousands of years and it’s not for us to say how they should live. There’s nothing wrong to be a bit on the beach, there’s nothing wrong to drink a glass of wine in a bar. Let it be. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"5 Oct, 2012 13:04",Aussie super-scope begins ET hunt,"The initial stage of unprecedented radio telescope has been officially opened in Australia. The project will explore the universe in search of new galaxies, black holes, planets and even intelligent extraterrestrial life – if there is any. In the heart of red desert where man-made radio signals are minimal the AUS$152 million worth telescope will scan space for traces of the beginning of the universe, the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, explore ‘dark matter that forms 95 per cent of the universe, check out Einstein's theory of relativity, and – who knows – it might find some proof of other life in the Universe.The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) has finalized construction of a radio telescope at the Murchison Radio Astronomy Observatory, situated some 300 kilometers northeast of Geraldton, in Western Australia.The director of CSIRO SKA project Brian Boyle said that the 36 dish Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) will “really push the boundaries of our knowledge of the physical laws in the universe"".The search for extraterrestrial life is going to be “almost a parallel activity to all the survey work that's being done,"" Boyle said.The ASKAP project is a part of a colossal $2.5 billion Square Kilometer Array Project to be completed by 2024 that would unite three large radio telescopes, two of them – in South Africa (MeerKAT and KAT-7 telescopes) and New Zealand – are yet to be constructed. Starting from 2016 an additional 60 dishes will be added to the Australian ASKAP observatory together with thousands of antennas.The project is called Square Kilometer Array because all three sites will be made up of a large number of linked antennas with the total surface area of each one approximately one square kilometer. Currently 13 countries and nearly 100 organizations are contributing to the project.""We will understand how galaxies work. We will look back into the very birth of our own universe,"" said CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Megan Clark.Australia's Science Minister Chris Evans said the telescope is a major innovation for his country.""This will be 50 years worth of scientific research performed in Australia, providing world-leading scientific knowledge about our galaxies,"" he said.In 2024 the system will consist of 3,000 dishes integrated into a single system with unprecedented computation capacity. The SKA radio telescope is expected to be 50 times more powerful than current radio telescopes and could look back some 14 billion years to when our universe began. Interesting facts about the Square Kilometer Array Project:Once finished the SKA project will become at least 50 times more powerful and 10,000 times faster than any other existing radio telescope on our planetThe data collected by the SKA in a 24-hour period, would take nearly two million years to play back on an iPod.The SKA will generate enough raw data every day to fill 15 million 64 GB iPods.The SKA central computer will have the processing power of about one hundred million PCs.The SKA will use enough optical fibre to wrap twice around the Earth.The dishes of the SKA will produce 10 times the current global internet traffic.The aperture arrays will produce more than 100 times the current global internet traffic.The SKA super-computer will perform operations per second equivalent to the number of stars in three million Milky Way-size galaxies. The SKA will be so sensitive that it will be able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away.All data taken from the official SKA Africa website.

"22 Aug, 2012 10:37","Big Bang? No, Big Chill! Australian scientists challenge universe creation theory","A team of Australian physicists have come up with their own theory on the universe’s creation. Challenging the “Big Bang” model, they now say it was a “Big Chill” – somewhat similar to water first freezing into ice and then cracking upon cooling. Researchers from the University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) brushed away the theory of the start of the universe as being a “big bang”.  That model posits that our universe apparently inflated, expanded and cooled, going from very, very small and very, very hot and dense, to the size and temperature of our current universe. The followers of this prevailing theory believe it continues to expand and cool to this day.The Australian physicists, however, put forward a new concept which suggests that the secret to understanding the origin and nature of the early universe is in the cracks and crevices common to all crystals, including ice.  The idea is that the early universe was liquid-like and it cooled, crystallized, and possibly cracked. Their report was published in the journal Physical Review D.Their research rests on a school of thought that has emerged recently. A new theory, known as Quantum Graphity, suggests that space may be made up of indivisible building blocks, like tiny atoms. These indivisible blocks can be thought of as similar to the pixels that make up an image on a screen. The challenge however has been that these building blocks of space are very small, and thus impossible to see.The Australian scientists now believe they may have figured out a way to see these “building blocks” – indirectly.""Think of the early universe as being like a liquid,” says James Quach, a lead researcher on the project, who did the study as part of his PhD. ""As the universe cools, in a similar way that water freezes into ice, structure becomes emergent. You get the 3D space we see around us, but also like water freezing into ice, you get defects.""""The reason we use the water analogy is water is without form,” Quach explained. ""In the beginning there wasn't even space. Space did not exist because there was no form.""Just as ice cubes in our fridge crack, so did space, the theory goes.Quach and colleagues calculated the way light is scattered by these cracks and say that it is now possible for experimental physicists to look for this effect.""Light and other particles would bend or reflect off such defects, and therefore in theory we should be able to detect these effects,"" says RMIT University research team member Associate Professor Andrew Greentree. Quach says this theory would be more complete than the Big Bang theory, which is based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity, but is unable to explain the moment of the Big Bang itself.""Ancient Greek philosophers wondered what matter was made of: was it made of a continuous substance or was it made of individual atoms? With very powerful microscopes, we now know that matter is made of atoms,"" said Quach.""Thousands of years later, Albert Einstein assumed that space and time were continuous and flowed smoothly, but we now believe that this assumption may not be valid at very small scales,"" he added.The team now says if their predictions are experimentally verified, the question as to whether space is smooth or constructed out of tiny indivisible parts will be solved once and for all.

"28 Jun, 2012 09:47",'Capitalism to be replaced with Socialism 2.0',"The future of humanity depends on whether “too big to fail” sectors of the economy are taken under public control, creating a step-up socialist model, believes Peter Mertens, Belgian politician and author, the head of the Workers’ Party of Belgium. The root of the ongoing crisis is overcapacity in the production, Mertens believes. He says the policy of creating artificial consumption was a stopgap measure and it has failed.Europe is at a crossing point, Mertens told RT. The choices are, keep the euro at the expense of renouncing national sovereignties to live in an authoritarian German-led Eurozone, or split up into several conglomerates. Yet there is a third way, when strong mass movements find political translation to go for something like a socialist Europe with public banking and energy systems and true democracy.RT: The title of your book is “How dare they?” Who are they?Peter Mertens: After the crisis of 2008 we asked ourselves what has changed finally after this crisis. Because I remember in 2008 there were lots of declarations, for example from Sarkozy but also Obama, political leaders that said with the financial sector and financial capitalism – we are going to take really radical measures to change. And I wanted to see four years after these declarations what has changed. And I think basically on the financial level there is nothing changed at all. And if there is something changed it’s on the contrary those who are responsible for the crisis of 2008 who have received more power and even more financial resources. So the most important figure I think in the book is the study of Credit Swiss, the Swiss investment bank, that says that half a percent of the adult population of the world now have more than 38 percent of all the wealth on Earth. RT: “They” refers to what? Leaders? Obama, Sarkozy or the bankers? Who is the “they”?PM: It’s an open question but in each case there is a little upper class. In Europe and in the USA, that is composed of industrial capitalists, CEO’s of large enterprises; of bankers, and also of some politicians – it’s a circle, the system of upper class from people who know each other.RT: We’ve seen the banking system in trouble again. We have Austrian banks and even German banks in trouble, while they were supposed to be safer. Spain is in big trouble. If the problems persist despite the solutions offered by leaders in the past, does that mean that fundamentally the root of the problem has not been solved?PM: I think the root of the problem is in the productive sector because there are a lot of voices that are saying that it’s only the problem of the financial sector but in my vision you have this problem of overcapacity in production that is present today, like in the automobile factories. And traditionally what did the economy do to resolve this problem that there is more capacity from production than capacity of consumption? They close factories, they get restructuring and so on to demolish productivity capacity. But the neo-liberal way was also another way to tackle the crisis. And this way was to create artificial consumption. And they did it by reducing taxes for the richest people in the USA, afterwards in Germany and everywhere in Europe. They did it to give the middle class its credit cards – three, four, five credit cards. The system existed but they enlarged it to have artificial consumption and they did it finally to also give to people predatory loans to sell them houses when they knew from the very beginning that these people could never pay them back.And the problem of the banking and the banking crisis of 2008 was that small banks disappeared and the bigger banks stayed and now we have this problem called “too big to fail” syndrome.RT: This “too big to fail” reasoning holds everybody hostage, economies and politicians. At what point is this reasoning is not enough?PM: So in order to change things I think we need pressure from the base, we need popular movements, we are going to in my opinion see a Europe with a very large number of social conflicts. You are seeing it already, the beginning of it, the beginning of the spring of the peoples. We are going to need it.RT: It is true we’ve seen a lot of social upheavals across Europe. Are you’re saying that only when these social upheavals reach critical mass will there be any change all?PM: Europe is at a crossing point of three possible ways. There is the way from Frankfurt, or from Berlin. This is more authoritarian Europe and they want to save the euro by authoritarian measures. By taking national sovereignty to the European level, by mixing in matters like the salaries, for example, of each country, of the pensions of each country. The second way in the crossing point in my view is that Europe will separate again and that we’ll have two, three or four Europes like the strong states Germany, Holland, Austria on the one hand and middle states like France, Belgium and Luxembourg on the other hand; and then the so-called weak states. But it’s nationalism again and we’ll have conflict in Europe. And then there is the third way. In my view if the people and mass movements are strong and if they find political translation it will be possible to go to something like a socialist Europe, a Europe of solidarity, of cooperation, where the banking system is public, where the energy system is public, where there is democracy. RT: In your book you talk a lot about myths surrounding Greece. Why is it being misrepresented?PM: If you have the official figures everyone can look them up and everyone can see that Greek people are working more than 2100 hours a year – and that is for examples more than 600 hours a year more than in Germany, more than 500 hours a year than in Belgium. So this myth of the lazy Greek is not true. So I was asking myself why they are saying such things in the mainstream media in Germany, in Holland, in Belgium.And I think it is easy to understand because the establishment which profits from this euro story – for more than 10 years – is the German establishment and the Dutch establishment. So in creating this false conception of the Greek people you can say: no, it’s not a problem of economy, it’s not a problem of the Eurozone, it’s a problem of lazy Greeks.RT:  What about the euro project? Some argue that whether the euro is needed or not in pursuit of a United Europe is moot. The fact that it was chosen as a single currency years ago means that the decision has been made and there is no turning back. Do you agree with this?PM: So you have in Europe this organization called the “European round table of industrialists” and they are behind the scenes of the most powerful organization which has pushed this concept of one euro since the end of the 80’s in politics. From the beginning, European monetary union was conceived as a concept to create a big competitive Europe that could compete with the US, with Japan, etc, etc. And they knew very well that at the beginning of the euro there were these large inequalities in Europe. So they knew it and they said: oh it’s not a problem, we are going to create a system of convergence – that was the treaty of Maastricht, and under the norms of Maastricht they said we are going to level up all the countries to prepare for 2002, the introduction of the euro. And now here we are 10 years later and we see that the inequalities in Europe, they weren’t leveled up at all. But this euro created more inequalities than ever in the last 50 years in Europe.RT: The country in focus – Spain has been prescribed with the same solution as Greece and Ireland.PM: I think that really the financial sector all over Europe should be transformed radically and we need a public sector in finance all over Europe. Because now they can bailout Spain but it’s a very short-term measure because structurally it isn’t changing a lot and I hope they will help short-term. But you also need measures for the long-term in Europe.Einstein said once: stupidity, what is stupidity? Stupidity is to do something twice and think there will be another result. They said it would solve the crisis in Greece, now for five years Greece has been in recession, becoming worse and worse. And now they are going to take the same program to Spain and they are magically expecting another result.RT: What does the socialism 2.0 you talked about in your book exactly mean?PM: I think this competitive system has to change seriously and I think we are going to need again a socialist system where there is a large public sector and a system where there is also large democratic control and I think that for all those sectors that are too big to fail for humanity, like the banking sector, like energy sectors, if it is too big to fail for the future of humanity and the world you need to have public control. There are two sources they say in Belgium, for wealth. And the father of wealth is the work force: people are working and thinking and creating things. This is the father of wealth. Then you have the mother of wealth, they say, this is nature. This capitalist system has a problem with its own father and its own mother. They are exploiting the workforce and they are exploiting nature. Socialism 2.0 in my view is a system that is not exploiting its mother and its father but respecting the workforce and respecting nature.

"23 Feb, 2012 18:13",Was Einstein right after all?,"The CERN laboratory in Switzerland has found a flaw in an experiment that was set to prove Albert Einstein's social theory of relativity wrong. It will be carried out again in May 2012. One of the fundamental theories of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (300,000 kilometres per second). The famous big bang institute near Geneva tested the theory in September 2011. Their result was impressive. Based on results they claimed to have managed to beat the ultimate universe speed by 60 nanoseconds; a nanosecond is one-billionth of a second. The results of the experiment were met with great criticism by scientists worldwide as they are part of fundamental physics theory. Albert Einstein claimed that if anything could travel faster than light, time travel would be possible. And it looks like they were too fast to count the nanoseconds. The institute has admitted the speed reached could have been overestimated.Physicists say incorrect speed measurements could have been taken due to a loose cable connected to one of the speed-measuring devices, meaning Einstein may well have been right after all. CERN will try to check that again in May this year. But for now Einstein's theory lives on. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"9 Jan, 2012 06:04",Syria: Deadly price of pursuing change,"Amid heavy criticism for failing to stop violence in Syria, the Arab League has renewed calls for the regime to end bloodshed and open its borders to more observers. As the carnage continues, many say they are paying too high a price for change. The observers held a meeting with the governor of Damascus, Hussein Makhlouf, on Sunday and visited a local hospital to meet with relatives of the victims of recent violence.As the country edges ever closer towards civil war, hundreds of people from both sides are losing their lives every month – opposition, pro-regime, civilians, soldiers and children alike. On Friday, another suicide bombing in Damascus was yet further evidence of the escalating conflict. The attack hit the central Damascus neighborhood of al-Midan, killing 26 and wounding dozens. And all this has continued to take place with Arab League observers on the ground.“We went to the League and asked them to help,” a local woman said. “But they did not want to listen to us and did not respond to our complaints.”Exactly who is responsible for what is happening in the country right now remains far from clear.In an effort to shed light on the situation, people have continued to risk their lives getting information out of the country. Gene Sharp, a leading expert on non-violent revolution, calls the actions of the Syrian people “quite amazing.”“Even though so many people have been killed, they are going out on the streets,” said Sharp, a senior Scholar at the Albert Einstein Institution in Boston. “When the population loses its fear, that is a great achievement towards success.”But the opposition itself is becoming increasingly divided, with more and more Army deserters joining its ranks and calling for a violent overthrow of the government.“The danger now is that those soldiers who have been moved by these developments and defected from the Syrian army have concluded that they need to use violence to fight the rest of the Syrian army. If they want to succeed, that is not the way to do it,” explains Sharp.The Arab League has once again renewed calls for the violence from all sides to end, having met to review their findings so far.All across the country right now people are fighting tooth and nail for the right to determine their own future. Despite government promises, many people now feel that simply too many lives have been lost, too much blood has been shed, for anything other than real change to be an option.

"3 Oct, 2011 17:06",CIA contractor fights man over bagels,"Eight months after he killed two allegedly armed men in Pakistan, CIA operative Raymond Davis is facing legal troubles again. This time for being very, very hungry. Davis made headlines earlier this year after an incident in Lahore, Pakistan which ended with two supposed robbers dead. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted Davis had diplomatic immunity and be freed immediately, but it took two months for Davis to be released from a Pakistan prison. In the meantime, it was revealed that he was a government operative orchestrating clandestine operations in Pakistan. In the months before the assassination of Osama bin Laden, the January incident was one of the first events of 2011 that led to increasing disagreements between Pakistan and the US over America’s ongoing military presence in the Asian country.Now Davis is at it again, but time the event took place in the parking lot of an Einstein’s Bagel store in Colorado. According to media reports, Davis began brawling with another man in the town of Highlands Ranch over the matter of an empty parking spot. Jeffrey Maes, 50, was pulling into a parking spot on Saturday morning only to be met by an enraged Davis, who insisted the spot was his. Maes’ wife tells The Daily Beast that Davis got out of his car behind them, cursing, claiming the spot for himself. From there, Davis punched Maes once in the face, knocking him unconscious.When Maes regained consciousness, his wife says that Davis continued to fight him, screaming “You’re done. I’m going to get you.”“I’ve never seen a man so full of rage,” Davis’ wife told reporters.Davis was charged with third-degree assault and disorderly conduct, but is free again after posting nearly $2,000 bond. Earlier this year the US government paid $2.3 million to the families of Davis’ Pakistani victims. Saturday’s incident came only a day after the CIA once again assassinated two men. This time it was al-Qaeda militants Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, who were the target of a CIA-led drone strike in Yemen on Friday. Both men were American citizens.

"22 Jun, 2011 07:32",Hitler always wanted to invade Soviet Union – historian,"To Europe, Hitler justified the military campaign against the USSR as a crusade against communism, a menace to be destroyed, explains British historian and author Dr Michael Jones, well-known for his books on World War II. “But underneath that and the real truth about this war was race hatred. If one reads Mein Kampf, Hitler’s own book, it is clear that he always wanted to cover that living space in the East and do so at the expense of the people he regarded as racially inferior,” revealed Dr Jones.Hitler explained to his staff that this is going to be a war of annihilation, and “it did not take Einstein to realize the consequences of that, that there would be horrific losses [of the invaded nation] and what really happened.”Despite the Munich Pact, the USSR and Germany became allies. However, Stalin was not naïve and believed Hitler would attack later and the Soviet Union would have time to re-equip its army and transfer its economic policies to the war-time regime. Instead, the Red Army was mercilessly hammered out, losing between two and three million men by the autumn of 1941.“Few other armies in the world could have sustained that level of punishment and still carry on fighting,” Dr Jones pointed out.It was not just tough Stalin leadership – which was unquestionably necessary under the circumstances – but the “profound patriotism of the people who realized that it was a battle for survival, with not just the communist system at stake but Russia as a country and the Soviet Union as an embodiment to that and it really did become a Patriotic War”.Hitler and his generals were carried away by their previous successes – blitzkrieg campaigns in Europe. They expected another lightning war that would end in several months, and indeed they hammered the Red Army at the frontier but “they underestimated the Red Army and they underestimated the Soviet Union”.History is written by the victor, but the role of the Soviet Union in defeating Hitler is vastly underestimated in the West due to the legacy of the Cold War. “This part of our history is very strongly determined by the Germans, because the German view became incorporated into historical thinking with the Cold War, so there is underestimation or unwillingness to recognize what the Soviet Union did fully,” states the historian.“The other reason is the scale. We are talking about 27 million in terms of civilian and military casualties [of the Soviet Union]. It is simply so big that people struggle to really comprehend it.”One of the things Dr Michael Jones wanted to do in his book is to make that story comprehensible again to the Western audience, to give it a human voice “so that people can relate to it rather than it being just a massive overwhelming statistic.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"26 Jan, 2011 19:42",Foreclosing of America: The crisis continues,"Struggling Americans are going to great lengths to save their homes in the face of a worsening economic crisis. As Wall Street boasts record profits and Washington insists we are firmly on the road to economic recovery, millions of Americans still have that sinking feeling, worried they’ll soon lose the roof over their head.“It’s hard to sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t make plans because you don’t know if the next week you’re going to get a letter that says you have to go,” said homeowner Jose Rodriguez.He is one of thousands of people who camped out in front of the Los Angeles Sports Arena to line up for a mortgage help clinic, a last ditch effort for simply trying to keep their homes.Rodriguez fell behind on his mortgage after his wife became sick and medical bills flooded in.“Maybe 500 people made bad decisions or maybe a thousand people. But when you see 5 thousand people out here, you know it’s not just people making bad decisions,” said Bruce Marks, founder of Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. “It was a racketeering scheme that really put people in a position to fail.”And fail they did. A record 2.9 million homes went into foreclosure in 2010.Yet Realty Trac, an online market for foreclosures, warns that figure may jump by 20 percent this year.Many lost homes are due to lost jobs, as high unemployment persists in California and across the nation. “These banks and government look at people as numbers,” said Marks.“They should come out here in the early morning hours to see people freezing in tents just to save their homes,” Marks added.Desperate homeowners are fighting back.In December, hundreds of protesters tried to move into the lobby of a Chase Bank branch in downtown Los Angeles, as a way to shed light on the foreclosure crisis.22 people were arrested, including an 85 year old woman. They may have sent a message, but many see it as a lost cause, a view reinforced by the recent appointment of William Daley as the president’s Chief of Staff.Daley is a former executive at JP Morgan Chase, a major mortgage lender.“Big companies are taking over our country.That’s my feeling and I don’t know much about the economy,” said Rodriguez as he stood in line waiting for help in modifying his home loan.You don’t have to be Albert Einstein to figure out that with big business playing a bigger role in the White House; it is unlikely the help to stop the foreclosing of America will come anytime soon.Nomi Prins, a senior fellow at Demos and the author of ""It Takes a Pillage"" said the term “foreclosure” is disappearing from US politics, it was even absent for the State of The Union address because many are afraid to address the reality of the housing market. “Foreclosures are sort of the ugliness that really is at the core of how a lot of the institutions made their money,” she explained. “The people that are facing foreclosure, that have faced foreclosure, we’re talking about 8 million families, not even people, but families that have already gone through the process, others in the process. An expectation of 4 million more families to face foreclosure over the next 2 years of this administration and all of that is something that Obama doesn’t want to address and Washington has largely stopped addressing.”She explained America is still in crisis, not the banks or the firms, but the American people and middle class. “Nothing has been fixed,” Prins said. The banking industry was saved by the government and their crisis has passed. The government on the other hand has not helped the people, has not bailed out American citizens. “There is this dislocation,” she remarked. “The reality is that jobs are not being created in the country, the student loan debt for example is higher than it has ever been, foreclosures are continuing to increase, defaults are increasing, credit card fees on top of credit card debt continue to increase and there is no operation, there is no legislation, there is no reform being put forth to address this.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"16 Jul, 2010 23:33",65th anniversary of first nuclear test,"It started with a pen and paper, a letter written by Albert Einstein to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, explaining the urgency of work on uranium fission. Several nations in Europe had become entrenched in the Second World War, and the United States propelled itself into work on developing a nuclear bomb. “Tens of thousands of people worked on it,” said Robert Norris, Senior Research Associate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The largest corporations in America were recruited. So it’s not something that can be done in a laboratory here.” Instead a large bomb weighing almost 10,000 lbs was assembled at a top secret facility Los Alamos, New Mexico. “The nicknames for the two bombs that ended World War Two – one was called Little Boy and that was a uranium fueled weapon,” Norris said. “And then Fat Man.” The Fat Man, or implosion bomb, used plutonium instead of uranium. At the center of it was an initiating device encased in a highly explosive shell that made the blast wave go inward. At 5:30 am only July 16, 1945, the test was carried out. “July 16 is really the beginning of a new era in our history,” Norris said.  It was the beginning of the atomic age and of the arms race. “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent.” These are the words of  Robert Oppenheimer, the Scientific Director of the Manhattan Project. Three weeks after the test in New Mexico, known as the Trinity Test, the uranium bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days after that on August 9, the Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki. A few days later the Japanese surrendered and the pacific war was over. The action itself of colossal important but experts say the ability to develop and test became the driver of the arms race. “The British got it, the French got it, then the Chinese,” Norris said. “Then the Indians, the Pakistanis. Now the North Koreans have tested twice.” “The reason why countries tested over the years is primarily to develop new and more deadly types of nuclear weapons and to demonstrate their power and to send signals to one another,” said Daryl Kimball with the Arms Control Association. Signals like the one sent by Iran, signals that even today steer relations and shift the balance of power around the world.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"6 Mar, 2010 04:02",Civil liberties abandon web: Fed web spyware to every home,"The U.S. government is considering extending so-called Einstein technology into American homes. The Einstein Three software is designed to detect and prevent cyber attacks, but as CNet News journalist Declan McCullagh says, the move raises questions about an invasion of privacy . The people running it will let the government sit in on their individual web traffic.  “Once this infrastructure is in place and you have something that can watch what people are doing or block access to some websites the government does not like, then you have a potential civil liberties nightmare,”warned McCullagh. The government has an incentive to over hype cyber security. “This is war. There is war on drugs, war on terror, now there is war on cyber, I guess,”McCullagh said. The government, on behalf of defense contractors, politicians and even some journalists, backs this project. “In reality there should be no critical infrastructure on the internet. If it is critical, do not connect it to the internet. There should not be nuclear power plants hooked onto the internet. If they are, this is wrong for your homeland security, just take a look at that instead of saying we need to eavesdrop on the internet even if it is a limited eavesdropping for security purposes,”McCullagh said.

"2 Dec, 2009 12:40",Obama unveils his controversial plan on Afghanistan,"US President Obama has unveiled his future strategy for Afghanistan in a keynote address at the West Point Military Academy in New York. 30,000 more troops will be deployed, almost doubling the numbers there already. “It is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 troops,”he said. The total number of American troops in the region will now be over 100,000. The most recent estimates suggest $1 million are spent per soldier per year in Afghanistan. All that cash will be injected into warfare when millions of Americans live without jobs and homes.  But Barack Obama says he is sure of his decision:“I refuse to go beyond goals that would go beyond our means”. In a speech that echoed the one made by Bush just before kicking off the war in Iraq – only lasting almost twice as long – Barack Obama has outlined the key steps: fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and strengthening Afghanistan’s Government and security forces. Obama plans to escalate the war to the fastest possible pace, but he has also announced a withdrawal. According to Obama, the US could begin pulling out as early as the middle of 2011. The efforts of Obama's administration will now be focused on getting the new plans through Congress. Hearings on the new Afghan strategy began on Wednesday. The President's decision has so far failed to garner much political support, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing grave doubts about the increase in troops. Meanwhile, around the world there has been a mixed reaction to Obama's plan. NATO says “It's not just America's war,” while the Taliban is vowing to step up its resistance. Some in the US are also skeptical Obama’s new strategy will work. Radio host Thom Hartmann sees the move as“terrible”. “You have a nation that has an overall literacy rate of about 10 percent, you can't conquer a nation like that. You can't deal with a nation like that militarily. I think he is making a terrible mistake,”Hartmann says. American journalist Jerry Mazza sees the plan as pointless. “They want to diminish the power of the Taliban, of the insurgency. These guys are not going to go anywhere – they live there! I think it’s insane, quite honestly. As a parent – to know those guys are there to begin with, and that they are sending more of these young people there…”Mazza says. Financial analyst Max Wolff says nothing is new and the plan is just more of the same. “We are looking at a $33 billion per year increase. If we are looking at 3 years, we will be seeing $100 billion spending,”Wolff says adding,“Keeping doing the same thing and expect a different outcome – is Einstein’s definition of insanity. I’d like to be given a more qualitative assessment of what we are going to do differently”. The President wasn’t successful in convincing the majority of Americans who elected him a year ago that the war was necessary and affordable, said Jake Diliberto, an Afghan war veteran and founder of the “Rethink Afghanistan” movement. The plan Obama has sent forward is not going to accomplish the goals he prescribed, Diliberto told RT. “The reason for that is because an 18-month deployment of 30,000 troops is not a realistic perspective,”Diliberto explained.“It’s going to take these troops at least three months to get comfortable in the country and it’s going to take at least nine months to develop some sort of relationships with Afghan people on the ground.”  Natalia Burlinova from the Historical Perspective Foundation says people need to look beyond the numbers and understand that, in taking this decision, President Obama is keeping in mind the next election. “Sending more troops to Afghanistan won't bring any crucial changes to the situation in the region. It may help to stabilize, but only until the pullout date that Obama has declared. We have to understand his decision was political,”Burlinova said.“The Afghan issue has split the US establishment, some urging the president to deploy more force, others against. Obama has tried to please both sides, which means he's thinking of the next election. So by that time he'll be able to tell voters: 'I did bring stability to Afghanistan, we're pulling out, so you can vote for me again'.” Some even say escalating the Afghan war is the biggest decision of the Obama presidency so far. And the pull out date is seen as a sales pitch by many, like Iraq war veteran Adam Kokesh. “I don't give his message about a withdrawal strategy any kind of credence, because we've heard this kind of propaganda before,”Kokesh says.

"4 Jun, 2009 05:41",Even presidents can learn,"After criticism from visitors to his blog - who complained that he lacked a human side - Dmitry Medvedev has responded by taking a trip down memory lane to his old school. And what did we learn? That you need not be an Einstein, for instance, or even the school football star, to rule the country. He could have been a good scientist. Instead, he is only a president. Medvedev opens up on his nostalgic back-to-school trip, recorded in his blog.  “School years are different for everyone. I wasn’t the brightest of students, to say the least,”President Medvedev says. And it was not the only frank confession he made. Walking through his school’s classrooms, he did not quite remember it all. “Ok, maybe a formula, do you remember any, difference of squares for instance?”was the teacher’s question. “Nope, I don’t even know what to write. Here: although it’s not mathematics,”Medvedev answered, writing the equation for Einstein’s Theory of Relativity on the black-board. Apparently, Medvedev fell short of his teachers’ expectations. They were sure he would become a chemist. “My most successful chemical experiment was the least harmful one; the one that didn’t cause a lot of damage,”the president recalls.   A lot has changed since Medvedev graduated from school in 1982. And some things, like the Soviet past, are hard to forget. “Look at this,”Dmitry Medvedev exclaimed when he spotted an old, Soviet-era poster.“This poster is from my time. The uniform is just like we used to have. Look – the red pioneer tie… Amazing!” “And why do we still have this here?”the teacher herself exclaimed in surprise. “Just in case power changes back to Communism again,”the president suggested. Over in the gym, he showed that he still remembers how to do chin ups – something he might have practiced. He also knows how to score a goal. “Can you hit the target?”people on the football pitch asked Dmitry Medvedev. “Of course, you understand: I hit and you naturally miss. There’s no other option. The president can’t miss,”said the president to the goalie, and kicked the ball. Visitors to Medvedev’s blog gave him an earful for his lack of a human side. Now they know better: he used to get to the school cafeteria by climbing through the window, liked to burn patterns on wood and was not the best football player.

"24 Mar, 2009 08:59",When the drive to succeed goes over the edge,"A top psychologist who's proved links between inspiration and schizophrenia has warned against putting power in the hands of the most creative.  It comes as the G20 prepares safeguards against out-of-control bankers. Banks let talented traders gamble away billions of dollars, provoking the current economic meltdown. They held as little as 4% of the amount being risked, to cover potential losses. The German Chancellor's joined Britain to as much as triple the capital banks must keep. A joint proposal is expected at next week's G20 summit. Top psychologist Mark Batey, from Britains elite Manchester Business School, advises companies like Rolls-Royce and SonyBMG on the link between talent and mental disorder.  In a study to be published this autumn he warns those losses and future catastrophes could be avoided by resisting the most inventive. “What we found is a process called latent inhibition. There's a brain mechanism controlled by the frontal lobes, with creative people that mechanism is less powerful. The risk would be to run with a very creative idea that someone's very passionate, who can persuade you to follow in a very egregious way, but that is not fitting for the business environment.” Batey says Russia's top mobile entrepreneur may be a case in point. In nine years casual-dressed Evgeny Chichvarkin grew Euroset from 2 shops to more than 5,000, before a fire sale in December. Interpol's now hunting him for kidnapping employees and blackmail. Rivals say the 34-year-old would send Euroset-yellow vibrators, with vulgar notes attached.  Mikhail Gerchuk, Chief Financial Officer at MTS, says other gifts were equally bemusing. “We have received a set of other tools like a helmet, hammer, toys. Each has some meaning for his business. For example the purpose of the helmet was that no-one could put ”spaghetti on your ears,“ it's a Russian saying meaning to lie to you.” On Friday millionaire businessman turned mayor of Kiev refused Ministry of Health demands for psychiatric tests. Leonid Chernovetsky's solution to financial woe in Ukraine’s capital is to “auction a kiss with me, or a trip in my armoured Mercedes.” The 56-year-old exercised in front of the cameras to prove his health, and compared himself to Einstein. He insists “sucessful businessmen are so busy they’re all crazy.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"10 Mar, 2009 19:00",Will Iran spark a game of nuclear dominoes in Middle East?,"The prospect of Iran releasing the nuclear genie in the future is greatly upsetting the global geopolitical calculus in significant ways. For example, the United States, which likes to dangle unproven military carrots before Russia’s snout (ala Ronald Reagan’s ‘Star Wars’ fantasy, which allegedly helped push the Soviet Union into insolvency), is threatening to build components of its missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Moscow rightly views the Pentagon’s steadily circumvallating system as a direct threat to its national security.  So now, thanks to American intervention heroics, Europe has two potential adversaries as opposed to just one. And if Europe failed to appreciate the existential danger that the proposed American shield will place it, Gen. Anatoliy Nogovitsyn of the Russian Armed Forces did not mince his words when he warned Warsaw that, “Poland, by deploying [the system] is exposing itself to a strike – 100 percent.” Incredibly, however, any sort of debate on the proposed US missile defense system in Eastern Europe is rarely heard in the western European capitals. Despite the consequences that a US missile defense system poses for the European continent, “there appears to be little willingness in Brussels to engage in discussions on a missile defense shield,” wrote Oliver Meier in an article for Arms Control Today. “We are not as Europeans concerned to establish a mechanism of that type,”commented Javier Solana, EU High Representative. “It is for every country to decide” whether to cooperate or not with the Americans on missile defense. Strange that Europe wants little part of a debate that will ultimately determine how many missiles are pointing at it.  Incredibly, as the United States, Europe and Russia – victorious historic allies against the modern world’s gravest threats – aggravate their relations in the name of self defense, the Middle East threatens to give way to an arms race that may or may not be poisoned-tipped with nukes. But first, the good news (yes, there is some). Former US President George W. Bush, one of the main antagonists of this dark political theater, has been replaced by Barack Hussein Obama, who has declared his willingness to sit down and chat with his Iranian counterpart, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. However, Obama may never enjoy a photo opportunity alongside the fiery Ahmadinejad since Iran is holding presidential elections in June. Thus, any discussions between the US and Iran will have to wait at least until the summer, it seems. Since ultimate power in the Islamic Republic of Iran does not rest with the president, but with the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, there are good grounds to believe that Ahmadinejad, who replaced the mild-mannered and liberal-minded Mohammad Khatami in 2004, was nominated to dampen the endless reckless ambition of the Bush administration. What Iran lacked in nuclear technology, Tehran seemed to be saying, it compensated for in fiery rhetoric. And this was never more apparent than when Ahmadinejad told more than one audience that he wanted Israel “wiped off the map” (Iran’s foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki insists the Iranian president was speaking about the Israeli “regime” as opposed to the nation of Israel). It appears that what Iran really wants is a little respect, and this is obvious by Tehran’s constant demand that the “the Great Satan” acknowledge and apologize for its sins of the past. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, not the picture of fawning meekness by any standard, nevertheless in March, 2000 admitted that a 1953 CIA operation that toppled a democratically elected government in favor of the Shah was “clearly a setback” for Iran’s political development. Albright even expressed regret for supporting Baghdad during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war, which turned out to be the bloodiest Mideast conflict of modern times. Today, Iran is demanding more American public penance. “Those who say they want to make change, this is the change they should make: they should apologize to the Iranian nation and try to make up for their dark background and the crimes they have committed…,” Ahmadinejad said in a speech in January. But even if the hurricane called Ahmadinejad is elected out of office in June, this does not necessarily mean that Iran will halt its nuclear program, which may or may not be for “civilian purposes” as is presently claimed.  Some believe that if Iran is permitted to join the ‘nuclear club,’ this could set a precedent for other countries around the world, Brent Scowcroft, who advised two US presidents on national security, said on Thursday. “We’re on the cusp of an explosion of proliferation and Iran is now the poster child,”said Scowcroft, who served under former President Gerald Ford and President George H.W. Bush, the father of the former George W. Bush, as reported by Reuters. “If Iran is allowed to go forward, in self-defense or for a variety of reasons we could have half-a-dozen countries in the region… doing the same thing,”he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. However, Scowcroft and former US national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, counseled against using military action in an effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. They said that negotiations with Tehran should be pursued instead. Brzezinski agreed that nuclear proliferation in the region may be the greatest threat from Iran’s nuclear programs, as opposed to the threat that Tehran would make the “suicidal” move of launching the first bomb it built. Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons, although it has never confirmed or denied this. Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan is the only other country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, which it proved to the world just weeks after India’s successful nuclear tests in 1998. Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto promised in 1965 that if India built nuclear weapons Pakistan would too, “even if we have to eat grass.” The United States and the Soviet Union learned that the possibility of ‘mutually assured destruction’ (MAD, for short) was capable of maintaining the peace but at a tremendous cost to both national reserves, as well as nerves, as the Cuban Missile Crisis (the Caribbean Crisis in Russian) at the very height of the Cold War proved. Clearly, there were some individuals, but fortunately not the majority, who thought it “better to be dead than red.” What countries might be tempted to go nuclear if Iran enriches uranium? Scowcroft named Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. But hopefully such a ‘domino effect’ in the region will be offset by calm, cool-headed negotiations between Barack Obama and the next president of Iran. In the meantime, international leaders should make total nuclear disarmament the main priority of our age, for by hanging on the abyss of annihilation refutes all of our glorious human achievements that a single mistake may obliterate in mere seconds. In the words of Albert Einstein, whose scientific discoveries made the splitting of an atom a physical possibility, “It is not necessary to imagine the earth being destroyed like a nova by a stellar explosion to understand vividly the growing scope of atomic war and to recognize that unless another war is prevented it is likely to bring destruction on a scale never before held possible and even now hardly conceived, and that little civilization would survive it.” Robert Bridge, RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"12 Feb, 2009 16:48",Stupidity got us into this crisis – why can’t it get us out?,"Western politicians are trying to take the high ground, publicly criticizing bankers for paying themselves big bonuses. Bankers like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have shot back, saying, in effect, apologies and blame are not the point. Let's focus on getting out of the hole! The reason that’s not enough, Mr Dimon, is, to paraphrase Einstein: the people who got you into the mess cannot get you out of it. Or to quote Big Al more or less exactly, you cannot solve a problem with the ideas or mindset that created the problem. However, it is still a fair point: Bankers’ apologies or even their bonuses are a red herring. We don't need bankers to apologise. After all, an apology only carries weight if you respect the person making it. Otherwise all that is left is for the banker to commit hara-kiri to prove that he does, despite your derision, have some honour. There have been some tragic suicides but, as the journalistTaki Theodoracopuloswrites, they have been among the decent few financiers whose hands were the cleanest, not the dirtiest. What we need from bankers is simple:What is the value of your assets, marked to market?What is your own best estimate of the value of these assets?What is the chance of meeting your estimate, in what circumstances and over what time frame?What are your liabilities?Is your bank effectively insolvent and how did that happen?What is the best way to clean up the mess? And, by the way, you will NOT keep your job.To these questions (and western politicians haven't yet shown the competence to ask them) we have so far heard zilch. So, yes, forget the apologies. What we need are answers. Mark Gay, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more.

"15 Dec, 2008 05:06","RT Expert View: religious hopes, secular fears","This week we look at the revival of the Russian Orthodox Church and the possibility of Russia becoming a country dominated by religion. Peter Lavelle,RT’s political commentator and anchor In the past week the Patriarch of the Russia Orthodox Church Aleksy II was laid to rest. He headed the Church for 18 years. No one doubts he played a major role in the revival of the Church and the return of religious values in public life. Today the state sees the Orthodox Church as a partner. But has this relationship gone too far? Is the Church too close to the state and does this relationship marginalize other churches and religions in Russia? Should the next patriarch create some distance from the state? Sergei Roy,editor,Before I reply to these legitimate questions, I must define what Albert Einstein called “the position of the observer”: how do I stand in relation to religion in general and the Russian Orthodox Church in particular? Though these things are generally regarded as fairly intimate and one’s personal, even private business, I think that clarity in this area may throw light on the writer’s bias or lack thereof.My position here is quite clear, if somewhat negative: I come from a background that has been Voltairean since about the times of Voltaire. This particularly applied to the male line, who were liable to exercise their wit, if not wits, at the expense of unshaven Russian priests (popy), and were also frequently accused of following the Bacchus and Venus cults rather than any modern religious or atheist orientations. In the female line there was a tendency to observe the rituals of the Russian Orthodox Church and, in a few isolated cases, of Roman Catholicism, but this last was looked upon as some kind of fashionable nonsense by the rest.It is easy to see why I comfortably fell in with prevailing Soviet atheism, though I hated most heartily what was being done to the Church, its servants and followers, and especially to aesthetically gratifying things like churches, belfries, icons, monasteries, etc. This attitude should explain why, toward the end of perestroika, an unbeliever like me – and there were millions of people like me – welcomed the return of the Church to Russia’s public life and the restoration of its stature and physical and moral presence with warmth rather than hostility or tepid acceptance.Now, the most highly visible, emblematic figure of this restoration process was, of course, His Holiness Patriarch Aleksy II of Moscow and All Russia, may God rest his soul. He became that kind of symbol even before his enthronement in 1990 after Patriarch Pimen’s death: in 1989 Aleksy was elected to the Congress of People’s Deputies.I must insist that his participation in the earth-shattering events that attended the sessions of the Congress largely pre-determined the role Aleksy II was to play not just in the revival of the Russian Orthodox Church but in the state affairs of Russia, an issue that is of particular interest for us here.The State and the Church; that is indeed a thorny issue and a highly complex one: Russia is constitutionally a secular state, everyone is supposed to enjoy freedom of conscience, freedom to believe or not to believe anything – yet we constantly see religious leaders, and most prominently, leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church, participating in state and public affairs in ways that are far from purely ritualistic.My take on this is simple: in the given historical circumstances, Patriarch Aleksy II could not have acted differently from the way he acted – with wisdom, tact, dignity, forbearance, but with vigour and resolution whenever the occasion called for it.Consider the coup of August 1991, those several days when Russia could have slipped back into the rut of Soviet Communism. Did Aleksy II withdraw to his residence to pray in solitude for God to intercede and prevent bloodshed? No, he did not. He spoke harshly against the arrest of the country’s lawfully elected president Gorbachev, he actually anathematized the junta that attempted to grab supreme power in the land; his appeal was heard over the loudspeakers by the troops preparing to attack us. As someone who spent those awful 72 hours behind a barricade by the White House of Russia building, I absolutely believe that Aleksy II did his duty before God and man in the only possible way.And so it went on. There was another attempted coup and threat of fratricidal civil war in October 1993, the start of the war in Chechnya in early 1995, radical liberal reforms that left nearly half the nation below the poverty line, the 1998 financial meltdown, terrorist acts all over Russia, and an all too gradual restoration of normalcy in the eight years of Vladimir Putin’s presidency. It took great wisdom and faith to lead the Russian Orthodox Church and the people of Russia through these turbulent years, and the events left the patriarch no chance to withdraw from public life into monastic solitude or limit his activities to church affairs only. His spiritual leadership has been eagerly recognized by the highest officials of Russia as well as by about two thirds of Russia’s population who count themselves as believers (church attendance, just like the world over, is a different matter, of course).Critics may say that under Aleksy II the Russian Orthodox Church began to play too great a role in the affairs of state in Russia. All I can say is, thank God that the country was led by people like the late patriarch, not his critics. And I wish to God that his successor will conduct himself likewise.

"15 Jul, 2007 16:58",Peres sworn in as Israel's President,"Shimon Peres has been sworn in as Israel's President at a special ceremony of the Israeli Knesset, (the parliament). He replaced Moshe Katsav, who resigned last month after pleading guilty to several sexual offences. In his inaugural address, Peres pledge Shimon Peres has been at the forefront of Israeli politics for over half-a-century. He served twice as the Israeli Prime Minister, as well as holding other high-ranking ministerial positions – he served as the country's Finance, Foreign and Defence Minister. Peres was born 84 years ago in Eastern Poland, in what is today Belarus. He speaks English, Russian, Hebrew and Yiddish. His mother was a teacher of Russian literature and Russian language. In 1994, Shimon Peres was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with the-then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat. The prize was given for the peace talks that led to the Oslo Accords. Pope Benedict XVI has welcomed the appointment of Shimon Peres. He has urged the President to do whatever he can to jump-start peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. The majority of Israelis have also welcomed their new President. What they are hoping more than anything now is that he will restore dignity to this office that was all but destroyed by the disgraced outgoing President Moshe Katsav, who has been charged with sexual misconduct. Though the Presidential post in Israel is largely ceremonial, the President is a unifying figure and wields influence in Israeli politics.“It was made with the idea that a country needs to have a symbolic figure, like England has the Queen, other countries have Presidents. They don’t have power, but they do manage to symbolise the unity of a country with the rest of the world,”noted David Nahmlas, a historian. “The Office of the President costs the Israeli tax payers millions of dollars every year. A lot of this is used for certain ceremonies, for President’s visits to different countries abroad, to visit other heads of states, other Jewish communities,”said Mitchell Barak, CEO, Keevon. As surprising as it may sound, in the beginning not everyone jumped at the offer to be President of Israel.In 1948 Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin both refused. Instead, Nobel Prize Chemist Chaim Weizmann left his laboratory to take up the post. He and his successors fulfilled their duties well, staying out of political scandals and representing Israel in world ceremonies. But things changed in 1984, when Ezer Weizmann took his position too seriously and interfered with the Prime Minister’s job. His term of office ended with a police investigation into tax evasion. Careful not to make the same mistake twice, the government then chose a new President without much personality and little backbone. Moshe Katsav was smart enough to stay out of political scandals, but nobody expected him to be ruffling feathers of a different kind. His sexual harassment of female employers brought the Office of the President to its lowest point ever.Today many Israelisare asking themselves if they even need one.
