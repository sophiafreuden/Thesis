"25 Oct, 2019",George Soros says all his ‚Äòenemies‚Äô are wannabe dictators as he drops unprecedented wads of lobbying cash,"In the world of billionaire financier George Soros, his critics are would be dictators ù who will not succeed Meanwhile, under Trump, the opensociety founder has been pouring greater sums into lobbying than ever before I m very proud of the enemies I have, ù he told the New York Times in an interview published Friday, in which he confidently predicted the popular opposition to his globalist philosophy was winding down and that a backlash against Trump style nationalism was on the horizon It s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would be dictator, if he identifies me as an enemy Soros slammed the US president as an aberration, ùpredicting what he has done in the Middle East ù clearing troops from the Turkish Syrian border, allowing peace to break out with a deal between Russia and Turkey will contribute to his demise next year ù Trump has called out Soros in the past, accusing him of paying the protesters who swarmed the Capitol over Justice Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court and hinting that he was bankrolling the migrant caravans that swarmed the US southern border last year Soros is a popular villain among conservatives, who suspect that, after funding colorrevolution s in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, he is trying to start one in the US The currency speculation that has made him enemies from Malaysia to Britain has also made him rich enough to contribute billions toward funding what are usually described as progressive causes ù through his opensociety Foundations And he is spending more than ever on those causes, dumping some $15 9 million to influence Congress in just the third quarter of 2019 via his foundation s lobbying division, the opensociety Policy Center, according to a recent filing It s a jump even over the group s 2018 expenditures, which, at $31 5 million, made it the third largest lobbying group that year Only the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors outspent the billionaire Aside from lobbying, Soros spreads his money around liberally in more ways than one He has funded media organizations like Democracy Now! and Media Matters, pro immigration groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Migration Policy Institute, think tanks like the Aspen Institute and the Center for American Progress, fundraising organizations like MoveOn org that stages anti Trump protests, and interventionist policy groups like the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect He has already donated millions to the Democratic Party for 2020 There are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets, ù he said, calling Elizabeth Warren who wants to tax the wealthy heavily the most qualified person to be president Soros also has a mortal enemy China, † the nation that fought a winning battle against his currency speculating in 1998, so now he calls Xi Jinping s China the worst threat to an opensociety ù Given what has happened to the other societies Soros has poured money into, Xi might take that as a compliment ",https://www.rt.com/usa/471880-soros-enemies-dictators-lobbying-china/
"10 Oct, 2019",Who are Extinction Rebellion ‚Äî the ‚Äòeco-activists‚Äô grounding planes & shutting down cities,"Calling for civil disobedience in the face of climate change, Extinction Rebellion protesters have been remarkably successful in thrusting themselves into the headlines But what is the movement all about? And who s behind it? Best known for shutting down the streets of London in April, Extinction Rebellion upped its game on Thursday, with a protester affiliated with the group grounding an Aer Lingus flight from London City Airport to Dublin Another protester Paralympian James Brown clambered onto the roof of a British Airways plane and refused to budge, prompting police to eventually remove him Just about to take from London city airport Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protestor #londoncityairport#ClimateChangepic twitter com/eWBeeUiGHM The disruptions came as Extinction Rebellion threatened a Hong Kong style ùoccupation and shutdown of the airport, and as similar protests hit more than 60 cities worldwide Ultimately, it is part of Extinction Rebellion s aim to get people arrested, ùread a flyer circulated by activists in Dublin To that end, the group has been successful More than 1,000 activists have been arrested in London alone this week, including 50 at London City Airport The group sdemandsare threefold First, they call on governments to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, ùa similar demand to that made by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York last month A seemingly benign demand, but one that paints opponents as anti truth Secondly, they demand that government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 ùFinally, the group demands that government partner up with activists, and create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens Assembly on climate and ecological justice ù While a Citizens Assembly would draw on a cross section of society, it would be government created and guided by a collection of NGOs and academics, as was the case in Ireland when the government convened such an assembly to pave the way for referenda on gay marriage and abortion in recent years Extinction Rebellion make no mention on whether NGOs with opposing views will be included in the deliberation At XR s rallies, protesters have called for any number of ways of meeting these goals and more, including government bans on meat and private cars, abolishment of the airplane, boycotts of the fashion industry, and disbandment of the military Disrupting commerce is fair game for making their points, as is disrupting vital services As a cancer patient in London was forced towalkto hospital treatment due to XR s roadblocks, spokesperson Savannah Lovelock told Sky News that while she was really sorry, ùsuch action is necessary for the good of the planet Central to all of the group s demands is a radical expansion of state power Reducing greenhouse gases to net zero if a state led effort would give government the power to restrict or outright deny its citizens freedom of travel, freedom to choose their own diets, and freedom to build their homes however they want In the US,drafttextof Green New Deal legislation gives a sneak peek at just how all encompassing this would be, working wealth redistribution and reparations for historic oppression ùinto the mix for good measure A potent illustration of the group s appeal to authority came last November, when XR co founder Gail Bradbrook marched on Buckingham Palace and read aloud amessageto Queen Elizabeth with great humility, ùcalling on the monarch to save the planet by royal decree It isn t enough to live a life of voluntary simplicity, ùacademic and XR campaigner Rupert Read wrote at the time The implied meaning is clear: people will have to be coerced into complying Here s where things get interesting Exploding onto the scene with a recognizable logo, coherent imagery across multiple continents, a dominant social media presence and a slick website, the leaders of Extinction Rebellion are no rabble of bong smoking malcontents Especially not Dr Gail Bradbrook The co founder of the movement told the BBC that she came up with the idea after praying in a deep way ùwhile under the influence of psychedelic medicines ùon a retreat last year In truth, Bradbrook has made a career out of activism, and has for two decades worked as a professional campaigner Speaking at a talk in 2016, sheadmittedthat this role is mostly about securing your own paycheck ùAs director of Citizens Online a charity campaigning for digital inclusion, ùBradbrook has worked with BT to lobby the British government Joining Bradshaw are former organic farmer Roger Hallam, and also involved are Occupy London veteran Tasmin Osmond a granddaughter of British nobility and ex UN worker Laura Reeves Behind the movement is a bulwark of elite cash Heiress Aileen Getty has kicked in nearly 500,000 of her family s oil wealth to the group via the Climate Emergency Fund, claiming that disruption ùis necessary to take on climate change According to its own data, Extinction Rebellion has raised just short of a million pounds in largedonationssince March, from groups like the Children s Investment Fund Foundation, set up by a hedge fund manager and run by a former vice chairman of billionaire financier George Soros opensociety Institute Aside from annoying motorists and boosting superglue sales, Extinction Rebellion has achieved some of its aims Eleven countries and dependencies, beginning with Britain and Ireland, have declared a state of climate emergency, ùeven if Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar did say afterwards that the declaration was a symbolic gesture ù What Extinction Rebellion has also been successful in is pandering to the wishes of global financiers and the new captains of green industry The group s call for net zero ùcarbon emissions is echoed by the World Bank, and a host ofinvestment firms, including HSBC, JP Morgan Chase and Citi, that see profits to be had ùin climate related sectors ù None of this is a bad thing on the surface, except that these groups which have banded together to form the Climate Finance Partnership and Blended Finance Action Taskforce want access to taxpayer money and pension funds to do this This Western money, according to the groups, will be funnelled into projects in Africa, Asia, and South America Rarely do the demands of activists and the will of international finance line up, but not everyone is happy In London, Police Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has warned that the current protests will hamper officers ability to tackle street based violence, ùand leave the city more vulnerable to terrorism Street blockages and airport disruptions may put Extinction Rebellion at odds with the majority of the population, but majority support is unnecessary XR co founder Roger Hallam has repeatedlyreferencedGene Sharp as an inspiration An American political scientist, Sharp s theory of nonviolent action that only 3 5 percent of a population need to back a protest movement before it reaches critical mass and triggers change has been adopted and put into practice by colorrevolution aries around the world, from US sponsored student protesters inSerbiaat the turn of the century, to Arab Spring revolutionaries more recently Celebrities have lined up to endorse Extinction Rebellion from gloom rockers Radiohead chipping in 300,000 to Benedict Cumberbatch joining protesters camped in Trafalgar Square With elite cash and backing, as well as round the clock media coverage, Extinction Rebellion is well on its way to Sharp s tipping point, and has well and truly glued itself to the public consciousness already ",https://www.rt.com/news/470647-who-are-extinction-rebellion/

The answer is probably somewhat Unlike its uber liberal neighbor Sweden, Denmark has reacted to the influx of refugees and migrants with increasing hostility The coalition government made up of the center right Venstre and further right Danish People s Party has passed laws requiring refugees to hand over jewelry and valuables to finance their stay, banned the burqa in public, and planned to ship rejected asylum seekers to an uninhabited island in the Baltic sea are unwanted in Danish society, you should not be a nuisance to ordinary Danes, ù Immigration Minister Inger St√∏jberg stated when announcing the island plan They are undesirable in Denmark and they must feel it! ù St√∏jberg has been a key author of her government s anti immigration policies In March 2018, she marked the passing of her 50th anti immigration measure by celebrating with a cake decorated with fruit, the Danish flag, and the number 50 #DanishMinister for#Integration(!)

"27 Apr, 2019","Who checks the fact-checkers? Facebook leaves verification to groups funded by Soros, US Congress","In its crusade against fake news , Facebook has vowed to fight for impartiality However, when it comes to fact checking, it seems to rely on sources, which have links to the US government, and renowned political meddlers For more than two years, the social media giant has been seeking to convince the public that it does its best to take a stand against malicious disinformation spread through its network and presented a whole bunch of instruments aimed at revealing and countering false narratives It appears, though, that Facebook heavily relies on decisions taken by some third parties in its anti disinformation policy Submissions from the so called fact checkers alongside some feedback from users seemto be the primary source on which Facebook relies when saying a post is false Facebook proudly boasted that all the partners it cooperates with were certified through what it calls the non partisan International Fact Checking Network or IFCN However, the social network s choice of people to trust with the power to decide what is true or false does raise questions This seemingly impressive international network Facebook mentions is a projectrunby Florida based private school of journalism the Poynter Institute for Media Studies The project, which Facebook apparently uses as a sole instrument to find trustworthy partners, seems to be way more than just a selfless initiative aimed at helping people navigate through questionable information The IFCN waslaunchedin 2015 following a generous donation totaling $300,000, which the Poynter Institute received from two sources One of them is the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) a soft power organization, which is funded primarily through annual allocations from the US Congress Another one is the Omidyar Network a foundation run by the eBay founder and self described progressive billionaire Pierre Omidyar Although he has not yet apparently gained as much fame or infamy for that matter as another US billionaire and renowned political meddler, George Soros, Omidyar has also lately shown himself as a major patron of regime change operations As early as in 2014, the US mediareportedthat Omidyar supported anti government groups in Ukraine that opposed the then President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted during Maidan A report by Forbes alsosuggestedthat the billionaire was one of the major funders of the Kiev based Hromadske TV, which harbored anti Russian views while backing the violent 2014 coup Most recently, a group of

Democracy Fund another foundation linked to the eBay founder on its list of major donors, alongside opensociety Foundations (OSF) run by Soros and the NED The list of certified fact checkers provided by the IFCN certainly looks impressive It includes such international news agencies as Associated Press and Agency France Press (AFP), which appear on the list along with its branch offices in a dozen and a half countries In total, the network describes 66 organizations as verified signatories of the self styled code of principles itdeveloped However, the impartiality question remains At least some of the organizationslistedas reliable suppliers of the ultimate truth and described as partners by Facebook in fact receive substantial funding from the likes of Soros and Omidyar or even directly from Western governments One of these organizations called PolitiFact evenenjoyswhat it calls administrative support from the Poynter Institute while receiving significant funding from Facebook itself

Thereportreleased by the UK based political website openDemocracy this week spares no black paint to produce a picture of gross interference in European affairs The perpetrators are conservative Christian charities, which, the records show, pumped at least $50 million into European countries All the right names that can scare a left leaning reader are duly mentioned Donald Trump? Check Vladimir Putin? Check Steve Bannon? Check, three times Also listed are billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the DeVos family, including Blackwater founder Erik Prince, and the evangelical preacher Franklin †Graham who notably travelled to Russia earlier this month, the report stressed for some arcane reason #Collusion? I m in Russia right now îMoscow to be exact îand I m meeting with the Russian churches on how we can share with more young people about faith in Jesus Christ!

And how is it respectful of others freedom and sovereignty to impose values on them at gunpoint? The declaration creates more questions than it purports to answer The seven point platform pays lip service to freedom and justice, democracy and self determination, peace and security, free markets and equal opportunity ùIt also demands of signatories to support an open global economy ù Point Four somehow managed to advocate for private property and capitalism as well as welfare state and open borders, asserting the right to own property, purchase goods and services, and invest in free and open markets ùas well as free and fair flow of trade and investment ù but also demanding of governments to facilitate access to food, water, shelter, medical services, and educationfor their own citizens and others in need ù(emphasis added) Point Five also talks about an open and healthy planet ùin vague terms that combine overarching global environmentalism and migration across only nominally controlled borders The true gem is Point Six, the right of assistance ùthat would require governments to allow their citizens to receive assistance from others to advance these principles, including, in non free societies, support to non violent groups, political parties, and individuals aiming to foster democracy or human rights ùbut also the signatories to intervene where governments or other actors are unwilling or unable to cease or remedy flagrant or systematic violations ù Who would define non free societies ù?

The commitment to peace and security in Point Three asks the signatories to refrain from the use of force,except as just and necessary to advance these principles ù(emphasis added) The devil is in the details, as they say in this case, in that qualifying clause There is a massive amount of hypocrisy in the US and its allies advocating for free markets and open flow of goods and services, while being the world s leading source of sanctions, blacklists and blockades against those who resist their demands Likewise, the notion of initiating force in order to promote the values of this declaration is a total mockery of values advocated by the champions of modern democracy though it might be easily recognizable to ancient Athenians, who demanded the surrender of Melos with the argument that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must ù Perhaps the most pernicious notion in the declaration, however, is that it expands the duty to uphold its values from governments to private entities and individuals where they are able ùIt is not hard to see how this is a direct attempt to lend legitimacy to the legion of quasi NGOs backed by Western governments and their philanthropist ùhitmen like George Soros There is only one tiny little problem with this: it upends the entire international order based on the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which gave governments the monopoly on force within their territory The preceding Thirty Years War had seen much of Europe devastated by a conflict that started as a dynastic dispute only to spiral into a religious war characterized by widespread massacres and atrocities committed by official militaries as much as militias and mercenaries üö® We will defend our values, overcome past failures with new ideas, answer lies with truth, confront aggression with strength, and go forward with the confidence that our principles will prevail Join us #DefendDemocracyRead#ACDeclarationhere:https:// tdotco /JOy6l14nSnpic twitter com/GGFmbvCa6e Looking at the committee that drafted this declaration, it becomes clear why it seeks to legitimize the lawlessness of the post Cold War behavior by the bombers of Yugoslavia, invaders of Iraq, and regime changers of Libya Among the co chairs of the drafting commission are former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former George W Bush national security advisor Stephen Hadley, uniting the neoliberals and neoconservatives around the idea of a US led global hegemony The list of former government officials who signed the declaration also reads as a who s who of US empire boosters, from former NATO GenSec Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Denmark) to former foreign ministers Tzipi Livni (Israel), Radek Sikorski (Poland), and David Miliband and Malcolm Rifkind Labour and Tory, respectively of the UK Other notable names include Munich Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger, former deputy FM of Germany, as well as former Australian FM Alexander Downer, best known for his 2016 role in claiming Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was somehow connected to the phantom Trump Russia collusion ù The world could do worse than to take their declarations with a large chunk of salt Nebojsa Malic, RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/451783-atlantic-council-declaration-revisionist/
"14 Feb, 2019","Europe banked on George Soros instead of Viktor Orban, and will suffer the consequences ‚Äì forever","A clash of ideas is occurring in Europe between Hungarian PM Viktor Orban and financier George Soros that will impact the continent forever But Brussels is only interested in considering one option the Soros option Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In any other period of European history, Viktor Orban would have been heralded as a noble statesman by many of his peers The reason is rather straightforward He is attempting to do exactly what other European leaders have done for centuries before him, and that is defending the continent from foreign incursions But these are radical new times and the old rules no longer apply By now, most people are familiar with the mainstream media s narrative on Europe s plight Millions of desperate migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, suffering the untold ravages of war and poverty, are streaming towards Europe s borders in a quest for some semblance of peace and happiness There is a lot of truth to that narrative; millions of innocent people have had their lives totally upended by senseless wars sparked by Western regime change operations They deserve not only sympathy but physical assistance At the same time, however, Europeans are expected to sacrifice everything to assist these new arrivals regardless of the cost And the cost is nothing less than exorbitant InGermany, for example, asylum seekers are entitled to as much as 354 ($400) per month, while the state picks up the tab for rent and medical insurance All told, Germany isexpectedto fork out hold onto your hat 77 6 billion ($86 2 billion) during the period from 2017 to 2020 on feeding, housing and training their new guests In light of that massive assistance, is it any wonder that over one million people crashed Germany s paper border in 2015 alone? This leads us to an obvious question that the Western media never discusses: Would this great migration of people have occurred without the promise of generous handouts by European capitals? It seems that without some sort of security net in place, the majority of these people would not have risked such ahazardousjourney Moreover, there are huge budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored (yet are), for as any economist knows, money does not grow on trees This is Sweden Around 15 cars were set on fire in the city of G√§vle tonight 5 women sexually assaulted in Uppsala this weekend Also, there was 4 bombings in 24 hours This is not the Sweden I used to knowüò≠pic twitter com/f1Oqfr0YYT George Soros, the head of opensociety Foundations, believes he has that problem figured out To finance it, heexplainedcasually, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later Really? Well, judging by the Yellow Vest protests occurring on a weekly basis in the French capital, initially sparked by the imposition of a new fuel tax, we have some good indication as to how enthusiastic Europeans will be for such a plan In short, not very The questions don t end there How is it possible that George Soros has been able to sell his unproven and very expensive plan for open borders to the European people? We can take some guidance from the pithy expression Money talks In that case, nobody has done more talking in Europe than Soros Over the years, the billionaire has assembled some 226 reliableallies in the European Parliament to promote his vision of a brave new Europe This cozy arrangement allowed his opensociety European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of opensociety Foundations, tomeetwith members of the European Commission on 65 separate occasions last year alone It s probably safe to say that those closed door meetings had no small impact on the political landscape of Europe Enter Viktor Orban, the bane of Brussels, who is playing a role in European history that cannot be overestimated The leader of fiercely independent Hungary has taken a zero tolerance approach to illegal immigration,refusingto permit a single illegal immigrant to enter his country Meanwhile, other eastern European countries Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which, together with Hungary, form the anti immigration Visegrad Group have takensimilarsteps At the same time, across Europe right wing parties aresurgingin popularity In direct defiance of Brussels, Orban has ordered the construction of a barbed wire fence that runs along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia, a project that the mainstream media somehowconflateswith authoritarianism, as if the concept of national borders never existed before in history OrbansentBrussels a bill for half the cost of the fence, but it was never paid, of course That s too bad, because it could have been the smartest money the EU ever spent, since it would have spared Europeans the influx of mass illegal immigration The Hungarian leader has other ideas that Brussels will probably not be considering any time soon, like ways of addressing Europe s dire demographic problem This month, Orban announced a raft of new tax and loan incentives for families as part of government efforts to boost the birth rate without depending on immigration flows to accomplish that goal There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration, hesaidin his annual state of the nation speech We need Hungarian children The plan has some merit Mothers will be eligible for a 10 million forint ($36,000) subsidized loan, he explained One third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born, and the entire loan waived after a third child is born Now compare Orban s plan with that of the Hungarian born George Soros, who somehow believes that maintaining strong national borders will fragment the union Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union, he wrote in Foreign Policy [T]hey also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards Building on that crooked foundation, SorosadvisedEuropean lawmakers back in 2016 that the EU should spend 30 billion ($34 billion) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year We already know who will be forced to pick up the tab on that massive expenditure, and it s not George Soros One reason that Soros and his 226 reliable allies support the influx of migrants into Europe is they believe it will somehow offset the continent s demographic and labor shortage The latter part of that plan has already been proven a disaster An OECD reportfoundthat less than 40 percent of immigrants had completed an upper secondary school education or higher, while another studyshowedthat only eight percent of asylum seekers were hired by companies as skilled workers Despite clear signs that George Soros grand plans for the European Union are an utter failure, Brussels continues to heed his every word, while at the same time taking steps topunishOrban Just this week, Soroswarned, with no loss of irony, that if Europe doesn t wake up it will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991 The financier fretted over the rise of far right parties in Europe, which he believes will enjoy a competitive advantage in parliamentary elections in May Yes, that is a very big possibility Not once did he suggest, however, that just maybe his grand idea of open borders, made all the more tempting with cash enticements, might just have contributed to that radical disequilibrium of which he spoke If Europe is one day visited by the ghost of its fascist past, George Soros will only have himself to blame Influential people like Soros would have made a far greater impact had they advocated on behalf of peace in the Middle East and North Africa, speaking out on US led interventionist wars that have prompted millions of innocent people to flee their homes Innocent people from war torn countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria deserve the same rights to peace and happiness without having to travel thousands of miles away from home to find it which ironically leads them directly into the homelands of the people who invaded them in the first place! In conclusion, it is highly disturbing that Brussels is willing to give so much credence to a billionaire financier with questionable motives for opening Europe s floodgates to illegal immigration, while vilifying a democratically elected European head of state for attempting to exert some kind of order on a situation that is clearly way out of control @Robert_Bridge Think your friends would be interested?

a tome which insists Stalin had been secretly plotting an offensive against Hitler s Germany but first he wanted Hitler to destroy democracy in Europe, in the manner of an icebreaker, thereby clearing the way for world communism In other words, not the version you learned at school Except, surprise, surprise, this statement on Suvorov s book isn t true As †one scholarpointed out, while demanding a correction from Harding, it s more accurate to say the opposite is the case Indeed, †the scholarreferenced, Suvorov s argument was rapidly countered by much of the established Russian historical community, including Dmitry Volkogonov, with the support of Western historians We ve been here before with Harding He s repeatedly weaved fantastical stories about Russia, and other subjects, for years But, as the legendary ex Moscow hack Mark Amesobserves literally nothing Harding publishes, no matter how demonstrably false and reckless, will ever hurt his journalism career He s a Made Man Guardian hack Luke Harding was caught plagiarizing me,@yashalevine& others îand it had zero effect on his career advancement If his latest scoop ù on Manafort/Assange is debunked, there will be zero consequences Most of us still can t fully grasp thishttps:// tdotco /8AeD8GRXh0 And, while he s an especially blatant example, Harding is not alone in this Because on the Russia beat, it seems Western journalists can pretty much get away with any transgressions, without suffering career damage Instead, paradoxically, it often seems to even lead to professional progression Today, you hear a lot of hysteria concerning Russian disinformation in the West, but little or nothing, in mainstream media, on disinformation about Russia, something this writer has tried to cover in recent years And it s a lonely beat Indeed, as the Canadian academic Paul Robinson rightly notes, while there s a huge army of well funded institutions and individuals now devoted to uncovering and countering Russian disinformation, there seems to be little or no accountability for the false stories produced by Western sources (on Russia) And the examples are legion With even the most heinous fakes failing to amount to any sort of setback for their promoters Which suggests editors are more than happy to indulge the practice, because after all it s only Russia and everyone knows Russia is bad Here are a few selected lowlights Numerous other examples exist but more are hardly needed to show how there seems to be no penalty for getting Russia wrong in Western media And, on the contrary, it s hardly a conspiracy theory to suggest it s actively encouraged Which means, of course, disinformation about Russia is far more common, organized and influential than notional Russian disinformation Particularly on social networks, but prevalent too in supposedly respectable media READ MORE: The only Russian bots to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat linked experts Nevertheless, don t hold your breath waiting for the usual think tank info war chancers to issue reports, dripping with condemnation Because this isn t about delivering truth in the news, it s about keeping control of the narrative ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/448320-western-media-rewards-fake-news/

As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his opensociety Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East? Soros has an answer for that as well He calls it surge funding, ù which entails raising a substantial amount of debt backed by the EU s relatively small budget ù George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Any guesses who will be forced to pay down the debt on this high risk venture? guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the European Union, is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/447686-globalists-soros-france-protests/

"12 Nov, 2018","Criminal war, poverty at the heart of European & US migration turmoil","Europe has certainly adopted more fortress like controls against would be refugees A concomitant rise in anti immigrant political parties has in turn fueled popular resentment towards EU institutions is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others But the debate requires much more than moral appeals ù A recentstudyentitled Building Walls puts the growth of EU internal and external border barriers into stark perspective In the 1990s, there were two border walls Now the number has grown to a total of 17, with most of the structures built over the past three years Ten countries out of 28 EU member states have built physical barriers to control migrants entering from outside the bloc They include Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Latvia The authors of the above report call the structures edifices of fear ù and make the startling comparison to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany until its dismantlement in 1989 EU states have built border barriers equivalent to the length of six Berlin Walls The report also reproaches the proliferation of mental walls ù across EU member states with the rise of what it calls far right ù and racist ù political parties There are now, it is claimed, 10 EU states in which xenophobic ù parties have significant government or parliamentary representation However, the problem with a report like this is that it provides no practical solutions to the immense political and social challenges stemming from phenomenal migration The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that a record number of 68 5 million people worldwide are forcibly on the move from their origins, many of them trying to reach Europe We can perhaps agree that in recent years that the EU has faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443776-migratns-poverty-war-eu-soros/

At this point, I would like to say that, as an American, it is difficult to fathom how the question of a strong border has become such a political football The United States has a very fair system for allowing people to become naturalized citizens, and asylum seekers are accorded all the protections mandated by the law The only requirement is that migrants follow the legal procedures for entry, and if that sounds like a radical or xenophobic idea, as many Liberals today seem to believe, then the majority of countries in the world would have to be classified as racist Somehow the US went from being an ethnically diverse country comprised of law abiding immigrants, to a nation that thinks it s alright to accept law breaking border jumpers as future citizens In times past, before the age of virtue signaling, social justice warriors and PC dementia was all the rage, a group of undocumented people storming the US border would have been dealt with in the appropriate manner, and without any questions asked Today, however, many Western governments have been infected by the globalist creed, Merkel style, that says it is the duty of Western democracies to let oppressed migrants into their countries en masse and unmolested Meanwhile, it is the migrants who areportrayedas heroes in the Western media, while the people who want to defend their borders are some sort of knuckle dragging xenophobes In the case of the European Union, countries that fight back against the concept of loose borders, like Hungary, for example, are treated like pariah states, even suffering severe disciplinary action The situation is so grave and arouses so many different emotions that the issue of borders actually has the power to break up the West into two camps the nationalists on one side and the globalists on the other When one looks a bit deeper at the situation, the Liberal desire to accept migrants with open arms is dripping with hypocrisy and not a little blood After all, if the Democrats (and Republicans) really wanted to address the problem of mass migration at the root they would be out on the streets demanding that their governments cease and desist from waging war on sovereign states That is the real reason why so many people are fleeing their homes for a new life military aggression It s a national embarrassment that a group of illegal immigrants can cross our border and receive free healthcare/benefits, while veterans that have served this country are put on a waiting list Even tiny Honduras is no stranger to such violence This is something the Democrats should understand given former president Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton s botched efforts toinfluencethe Honduras military coup of 2009 In fact, that event, which brought to power a far right strongman, Pepe Lobo Sosa, goes far at explaining the caravan now ascending upon the US border In short, if the West would simply stop pursuing war and chaos around the world, much of which is based on avarice and empire building, the question of stronger borders would no longer be an issue, and those innocent people now in the firing line of NATO armies could rest easily knowing they can build prosperous lives in their own countries @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442423-migrants-caravan-midterms-crisis/

"12 Sep, 2018",EU's 'dangerous' move to punish Hungary 'reveals its authoritarian grip',"The EU parliament s vote to trigger Article 7, allowing punitive measures against Hungary, has provoked disbelief and indignation, with commentators describing the authoritarian move as contrary to the bloc s own self interests Citing Hungary s anti immigration policies and concerns about media suppression, the European Parliament voted on Wednesday to invoke the provision, known as the nuclear option, which is applied when there is a clear risk of a serious breach of EU values by one of the member states Implementing Article 7 allows for sanctions to be imposed on Budapest, including stripping the nation of its voting rights in the European Council The motion, which passed 448 197 with 48 abstentions, was roundly condemned by prominent Eurosceptics Former UKIP leader and champion of Brexit, Nigel Farage, warned that the vote revealed the ever tightening authoritarian grip of the European Union European Parliament votes to remove Hungary s voting rights, the authoritarian grip of the EU gets even tighter But those who support the European project and are working towards a more unified bloc should also be outraged, British historian, philosopher and author John Laughland told RT It s amazing to me that the European Parliament has done this From their own point of view, for their own institutional self interest, it s crazy The vote will likely also galvanize anti immigration parties ahead of European Parliament elections to be held in May, Paolo Raffone, a political analyst and founder of the CIPI Foundation, a Brussels based think tank, said This is a very dangerous type of action from the parliament, because on the issues of values, there s a lot of debate in European society He told RT that the recent successes of Eurosceptic political movements across Europe should serve as a wake up call to Brussels There is a clear trend of populist nationalist parties making gains throughout Europe, Raffone said, adding that it would be unwise of some of Europe s most powerful states, including France and Germany, to think that they are immune to the growing tide of Euroscepticism Still, the vote clearly served the purpose of making an example of Budapest, which has challenged Brussel s open door migrant policy and the bloc s concept of European values Laughland said that the vote sets a clear precedent that puts other EU states on notice Last December, Article 7 was triggered against Poland, marking the first time the measure was implemented But will the nuclear option achieve the desired results? Independent journalist Luc Rivet told RT that the vote accomplished little aside from victimizing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose popularity with Hungarians is only likely to increase While the vote s outcome was expected, what was truly shocking was the language used by MEPs and even senior EU officials while denouncing Orban during a debate in parliament on Tuesday European Commission vice president Frans Timmermanssaidthat Orban had chosen a coward s way out by claiming that the EU was targeting the whole of Hungary, rather than just its government MEPs also hurled insults at Orban, with Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, describing the Hungarian leader as a neo fascist Rivet said that these comments revealed an astonishing rift in the bloc s sense of unity The worst that Europe can produce we heard yesterday and today This bullying will go nowhere because Article 7 will never be applied Italy, Austria and Poland will refuse of course that this be applied, at council level, if not at parliament level Laughland also took aim at the report authored by Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini, which was used to determine that there is a clear risk that Hungary could be undermining the values of the European Union He called the report a grotesque exercise in disinformation, which is full of half truths and untruths, which really does great to discredit to the woman who drew it up Rivet echoed a similar sentiment, describing the report authored by Sargentini as a piece of work It s really incredibly aggressive in its content, and she didn t even go to Hungary to make this report She only relied upon sources like Mr George Soros and his friends So really it s incredible For Laughland, Sargentini s report illustrates two very distinct European worldviews When you compare it to the Hungarian government s response, you can see that you are dealing on the one hand with intelligence, with people who are intelligent and civilized, and on the other hand with someone who is stupid and malicious And in a way I think that s the most frightening aspect of it this conflict between intelligence and stupidity, or between civilized behavior and nastiness ",https://www.rt.com/news/438316-eu-hungary-article-seven-crazy/
"19 Aug, 2018",Attack on academic freedom or stand against pseudoscience: Is Hungary right to ban gender studies?,"Viktor Orban s Hungary risks becoming a European pariah after declaring it will no longer certify gender studies courses Even if they re right about their academic worthlessness, should officials tell universities what to teach? Astonishment was the word Budapest s Central European University (CEU) used inresponseto the government s measures without any justification or antecedent first proposed last year and outlined in detail earlier this month The 44 students enrolled in the master s program at the George Soros backed university would be allowed to complete their courses, alongside the 10 person intake at the state funded ELTE, the only other Hungarian university to teach the discipline But from next year onwards, the ministry of education will not spend public funds on gender studies, nor award diplomas for completing a degree (though CEU students can continue to study for the English language US certified degree) READ MORE: Christian democracy to crush multiculturalism in EU vote next year Hungary s Orban The decision places Hungary radically at odds with the rest of the Western world From Croatia to Ireland, every other EU state has at least one functioning gender studies program, and in the US, the number has risen threefold in the last three decades, with courses offered at over 350 higher learning institutions But perhaps more astonishing than the closure itself is the honesty with which the government is justifying its decision Although officials statements mention low enrollment, financial expediency, and real world applicability of gender studies diplomas, they have made it explicit that this is an ideological decision first and foremost For the first time in decades, a democratic country has made an explicit pushback against the left wing drift of academia The subject of the discipline goes against everything the government thinks about human beings, Bence Retvari, the minister of human resources and one of the ideologues of the proposal,toldparliament last year Gender studies îsimilarly to Marxism Leninism îcan be called an ideology rather than a science, and therefore it is doubtful that it attains the scientific level expected for a university degree course It can be argued that rather than being like Marxism Leninism, gender studies are in fact Marxism Leninism, founded on feminist theory and intersected with the latest left wing sociology and political science Here is asampleof the areas of specialization from the CEU course website: Gender Dimensions of Post State Socialism; Feminist Knowledge Production; Activism, Social Movements and Policy; Gendering Theory It is, frankly, doubtful that it is possible to meaningfully engage with (or even critique) most of these topics without contentious pre existing ideological suppositions And having emerged from their own traumatic history of totalitarian socialism, Viktor Orban s nationalists do not want to see their homeland re infected with a new strain they see as wreaking havoc in Sweden or Germany This study does not help in raising our nation; moreover it destroys value oriented thinking that is still present in the Central European countries Our burning problem is the demographic issue, which will not be solved by studying sexual minorities and deepening feminist philosophy, Lorinc Nacsa of the ruling coalition Christian Democratswroteto ELTE after it unveiled its gender studies course last year Stripped of the initial shock value, this perspective is at least understandable For the current government, the growth of a self perpetuating cottage industry of gender studies faculties around the world is no more a justification of their legitimacy than the popularity of alchemy at medieval universities is proof that base metals can be turned into gold And this fits in perfectly with Orban s vision of his provocatively named illiberal democracy, for which he has been given mandate by an overwhelming victory in April s election But the line between a robust democracy that refuses to shepherd its electorate into a narrow corridor of acceptable social views, and outright authoritarianism is not an impermeable one, particularly in a new, and still relatively fragile, social order such as post Communist Hungary ELTE issued an extendedstatementin which it accused the government of violating the constitution, and pointed out that its studies have specific societal uses, such as understanding the impacts of an economic crisis on women, or the social effect that many Hungarian women going abroad for childcare jobs has had on the men left behind at home ELTE also said the government did not directly inform them of the proposed changes, and demanded a consultation that would hopefully result in a compromise Gabor Bencsik, the pro government editor in chief of the Hungarian Chronicle, alsocalledon the ruling coalition to re evaluate its arrogant decision, saying that gender studies courses are not in themselves against traditional values, and could be used to ask questions such as Is it possible to boost the birthrate? or How can men and women in families better relate to their children? Despite these dissenting voices, the decision doesn t appear to have provoked concerted outrage, particularly as it has been dragging on for 18 months, and is sandwiched between dozens of other stories pointing to the ascendancy of the government, such as the campaign against Lajos Simicska, a former pro Orban media magnate turned nemesis, and the decision by Soros opensociety Foundation to close its Budapest offices If Orban s opponents want to reverse his policies, they will not do it with editorials about the Magyar dictatorship ,but will likely have to wait their turn at the ballot box ",https://www.rt.com/news/436329-hungary-gender-studies-ban-orban/

"1 Jun, 2018",Brussels sees threat to democracy everywhere liberals don‚Äôt win ‚Äì Hungarian foreign minister,"The EU doesn t know how to deal with its member Hungary, where the strong prime minister, Orban, dares to defy Brussels vision for the future How will Hungary hold up under pressure and how will this dispute shape the EU? We talked to the foreign minister of the country, P√©ter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, it s really good to have you on our programme again Welcome back P√©ter Szijjart√≥:It s my honour Thanks for letting me be here SS:Lots to talk about There are tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over the rights of the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Ukraine And you have said that Ukraine stabbed Hungary in the back ù What is Hungary s reaction going to be? PS:Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the European Union to help the Ukrainians to get the visa free regime and to make the EU Ukraine Association agreement to come into force And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine SS:So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn t abide by Ukrainian laws Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? PS:Well, you know, we are part of the alliance So it s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro Atlantic integration path And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission SS:So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? PS:There s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the European Union about how we see this situation We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations We will see whether there s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that SS:Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs You ve said those are lies Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? PS:We had and we re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti migration policy We made it very clear that it s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary It s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together We don t want to let neither the European Union nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don t want to invite We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context SS:Are they groundless? PS:Yeah, absolutely I mean, just let me give you two examples All these accusations say that there s no media freedom in Hungary But look in the Internet, for example, look at the web pages you will see that anti government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country In some Western European countries it did happen Or when it comes to anti Semitism it s a constant accusation against us Although we re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti Semitism There s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well It s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets SS: in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely PS: and compared to that we re always under accusations SS:Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights Could it come to that? PS:There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland We opposed that because we absolutely think it s based on double standards When you take facts into consideration there s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court So these are all closed issues So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary SS:So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn t meet those demands whether it s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: We may not fund you in the next EU budget ù Here s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to † 6 percent of your budget First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr Orban said: We don t need German money anyways ù PS:Well, you know, Hungary s interest is the European Union to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong European Union We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the European Union We have an export to GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the European Union to be strong and to have a competitive economy On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy But this is not a one way road We don t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends These funds are to be given to us based on contracts Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit This is one lane of the road And the other lane of the road is the European funding So, this is not a one way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation We totally reject that false context, we re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free This is not true We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies SS:There s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland the East vs West because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point I don t think Brussels likes it † What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? PS:We re absolutely interested in the unity of the European Union We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the European Union because the European Union must show unity Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let s put it this way, well, it s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the European Union We are the two countries where a one party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country We have absolutely stable political systems Many times it s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels There s a big debate in the European Union whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because SS: yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration That s what France and Germany want Do you think it s a viable thing? PS:Our position is that European Union can only be strong if there are strong member states So we don t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong European Union would be realistic We think that only strong member states can form a strong European Union That s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the European Union, meaning that we don t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes But the answer shouldn t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes SS:Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the European Union as an alliance of sovereign states European Union is the union that crosses state boundaries It s, like, the core principle of the European Union European Union is based on the principles of liberalism Your country is a nation based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing Russia s same way On ideological level there are so many differences In a basis it s not even economics Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? PS:Well, actually, it s not everything SS:But core things PS:Yeah, but look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we re somewhere in the middle, so, there s nothing extraordinary in this regard We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course That s why what we re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit based society There are debates about that as well But all in all our interest is the strong European Union because within the strong European Union Hungary can be strong SS:There s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are sandbags ù that can be thrown away Could it come to that? PS:Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the Visegrad countries are members of the European Union and will be members of the European Union Even more than that This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the European Union Our growth rate is much higher than the European average Everybody speaks about the German French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness But look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the European Union because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the European Union being strong as well That s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us SS:The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions There s the center Brussels, France and Germany who want more integration and maybe a two speed Europe It s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now Something needs to change We don t really know what Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won t be as integrated as France and Germany? PS:If you mean that the European Union is faced with historic challenges, you re right Not only one We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with So that s why I think it s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the European Union because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states For instance, take the migration issue Hungary s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country SS:I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway What s the point of being so tough on it were going to secretly accept those people anyway? PS:These are two totally different things Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth These two things shouldn t be confused because these are two different issues SS:The mood in the European Union in general is changing Austria has the first anti immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it s pretty much center right as well Do you feel like saying we ve told you so, we ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying ù? PS:You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the European Union the main issue was migration That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti migration policies You ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who s definitely representing an anti migration policy In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti migration parties In Hungary we ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior And you ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn t serve the target of a better future of the European Union SS:So how come so many countries in the EU are anti immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that Just as many countries are against anti Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending † them all of them agree silently to extend them Why can t you be as firm on anti Russia sanctions? PS:Well, ask me whether there are double standards I would say yes ù We are a small country And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here come to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are There s a big debate in the European Union whether the sanctions were successful or not But definitely the unity of the European Union is very important SS: Even if it is at the expense of the anti Russian sanctions? PS: that s why the prolongation of the sanctions has already been decided upon But it s interesting to come here to see the big Western European companies making business with the Russian counterparts SS:You know, we re open to anyone who wants to come and make business with us Thank you very much for this interview, Foreign Minister Good luck with everything PS:Thank you I really do appreciate it RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/428412-hungary-eu-pressure-deal/

"10 May, 2018",How the US stifles free speech: Reviving McCarthyism & nurturing Orwellian society,"The new or expanded Global Engagement Center under the State Department seems to be morphing into what one might someday recognize as Orwell s Ministry of Truth Recent events over past months have caused many to suspect the reliability of news and information provided to us, often by our own governments Alternative news sources threaten to disrupt the message or narrative crafted by governments and large organizations The US Global Engagement Center is mobilizing in response to counter alternative media, conflicting perspectives and foreign influence such as Russian Propaganda The rush to judgement, complete failure to follow international norms, and subsequent actions in response to both the alleged poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in the UK and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria leaves many questions unanswered That narratives of government officials and mainstream media (MSM) are in lockstep despite the lack of any real evidence makes one suspicious of the ultimate objectives Whatever these objectives may be, they certainly appear misplaced and bring increased international tension Both these instances have the appearance of false flag operations However, despite the lack of a thorough investigation, British Prime Minister May was quick to state the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent, Novichok, and claimed it was highly likely ù that it was the Russian government behind the attack †Both the UK and Russia are signatories of the internationalChemical Weapons Convention There are setproceduresto be followed in the event of the suspected use of chemical weapons, such as Novichok, which include notification of the OPCW, cooperation of state parties and the instigation of a fact finding investigation These procedures were not followed and, in fact, Russia has yet to be included in the investigation or even provided samples There seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding so many aspects of the entire incident Despite the lack of evidence and the fragmentation of the initial storyline, the Skripal poisoning served certain interests by diverting attention away from the UK government and toward Russia The subsequent mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK, US and EU countries caused the further deterioration of international relations Throughout this period, MSM toed the party line and lately it appears to have gone silent Closely following the Skripals poisoning, surprise surprise, the famed White Helmets released a video of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria †Once again, despite no evidence and prior to the arrival of OPCW inspectors, the US, UK, and France launched airstrikes against Syria, targeting supposed chemical weapons facilities There has yet to be any indication that a chemical weapons attack actually took place †Local citizens and doctors have testified recently that there was no chemical attack and that the incident was staged Once again, MSM fails to cover the inconsistencies of the story which call in to serious question the actual occurrence of the attack Information from MSM sources, for the most part, is completely in compliance with information either being filtered or suppressed to support the desired narrative The storylines, absent of credible facts or evidence, is reminiscent of the Trust Me! approach regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction that led to Operation Iraqi Liberation (renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom) †The most recent instances add to the ongoing Russophobic hysteria engulfing the West under a very questionable pretext Those that are skeptical of the official narrative or act to provide a differing perspective are frequently ridiculed and demonized, often accused of being one of Putin s useful idiots The list seems to be endless and spans from Russian scholarProfessor Stephen Cohenand Australian journalistJohn Pilgerto UK Labour leaderJeremy Corbynor, at times, even theRepublican Party This past year we have seen many alternative media sources essentially blacklisted ù by the secretive organizationPropOrNotwhichpublishedthe names of more than 250 alternative news sources, accusing them of being Russian agents The Washington Post promoted thestoryand, originally, ProporNot s List ù †Only later did the Post add an introductory comment and delete the direct link to the List The story was subsequently picked up and distributed by theDaily BeastandUSA Today InOctober, another blacklist ùsurfaced, identifying more than 2,300 guests of the Russian news station, RT The list was published by a Czech Non Governmental Organization (NGO), European Values, whose largest donor just happens to be George Soros opensociety Foundation in addition to US, UK, and EU government contributions We often view that the foundation of democracy lies in the freedom of one s beliefs, in one s right to express ourselves whether that is through print, speech, or the sharing of ideas The First Amendment enshrines these concepts with the Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom to Assemble Yet the ability to shape those ideas and thoughts relies on the ability to have open access to information and to participate in a dialogue of our beliefs and ideas With the advent of media, and more recently with the internet and social media, access to and sharing of information with differing views has expanded immensely However, recent initiatives have acted to stifle this open and free communication †The passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (P L 114 328, FY 2017 NDAA, section 1287) codified the Global Engagement Center and significantly expanded its role The Global Engagement Center (GEC) evolved from the original Counterterrorism Communications Center (CTCC) The CTCC was established in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 †Its objective was the coordination inter agency messaging and to coordinate specific messaging for the Department of State and Department of Defense †The CTCC went through several restructurings through the years until it was the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communication (CSCC) with essentially the same mission The organization had minimum funding and no direct line item from Congress President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13721 in March 2016, which officially established the GEC in lieu of the CSCC The GEC purpose and structure were similar to the CSCC It was tasked with leading inter agency efforts in support of US government sponsored counterterrorism communications Section 1287 states that the GEC s purpose is to counter foreign state and non state propaganda and disinformation efforts ùthat threaten US national security interests as well as security interests of US allies and partner countries This significantly changes the GEC s role from one of counterterrorism to one of countering foreign communications per se Moreover, it provides the new GEC with significant resource authorizations well beyond those previously provided Along with the significant expanded mission area and increased authority, the GEC will receive substantially greater funding and will include direct funding from Congress as well as authority for an additional $60 million to be transferred from the Department of Defense The GEC expansion of responsibilities is a result of the challenges of articulating a consistent message and to counter alternative information and perspectives Legislation seeks to strengthen the GEC in order to counter foreign influence, primarily Russian and Chinese disinformation efforts This evolution of the GEC is not without challenges Earlier versions of the GEC were underfunded and undermanned †The legislation and subsequent mission shift has been given to an organization operating with a focused mission to counter primarily extremist terrorism and ill prepared to counter global information flows with varying perspectives For instance, based on theNew York Times, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department s Global Engagement Center which has been tasked with countering Moscow s disinformation campaign speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts ùAs implied byVanity Fair, resource challenges, a changing mission, new technology, organizational confusion, and leadership uncertainty have contributed to the questionable performance and future of the GEC †Yet, the NDAA 2017, as well as more recent emphasis fromCongress, provide the clear intent from Congress for the increased global role of the GEC, along with the authority and resources to support it This, along with the recent confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new GEC leadership, may see the GEC rapidly evolve to complete its transformation and become the master of information Congressional pressure on technology companies, specifically social media organizations, throughout the evidence free Russiagate hearings has contributed to filtering what and how we access information †Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been grilled in hearings and are taking steps to control the flow of information Facebook has engaged fact checkers to verify information One wonders who checks the fact checkers? †Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google have also developed filters and Trust Indicators to prioritize what is seen, or not seen, and how, byusers This is done in the name of combating fake news or countering alleged Russian propaganda These actions, as well asdemonetizingsites, controlling advertising (RT and Sputnik advertising banned on Twitter), censoring information (SouthfrontandVeterans Today),de ranking as with RT, or cancelling and suspending accounts (SyrianGirl banned on Facebook and YouTube) directly influence one s access to information, essentially censoring for the good of the public Censorship and disinformation infringes on our ability to access factual information, to form our own judgements, to enlighten ourselves to differing perspectives †It essentially acts to shape our perspectives to preconceived narratives that may be counter to our own underlying values It is a realization of George Orwell s Newspeak †It is a direct attack on the most fundamental right of a free and opensociety the right of free speech †We have been gradually witnessing the erosion of the underlying principles of democracy The threat is not from any foreign power, it s from within Where are we going as a country? †Are we reincarnating McCarthyism? †Are we nurturing an Orwellian

UK politician Nigel Farage, the prominent face of Brexit, is now concerned about Europe s destiny Addressing the EU Parliament this week, Farage provided some thoughtful ideas as to the source of the claims that Russia had somehow manipulated the Brexitvote, as well as the Trumpelection Just last week, the electoral commission, in the UK, launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money, ùFarage said This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organization called opensociety ù But Farage, who seems to take great delight in agitating his fellow MPs, was just warming up He went on to provide yet another example of an EU parliamentarian working on behalf of George Soros, this time against Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, who hasaccusedthe financier of seeking to create a Europe of mixed population ù We even had last week Mr [Guy] Verhofstadtlobbyingon behalf of Mr Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, ùFarage said, pointing directly at Verhofstadt as he spoke I wonder, ùFarage continued, when we are talking about political collusion, I wonder if we are looking in the wrong place ù FaragedescribedSoros s influence in Strasbourg and Brussels as truly extraordinary ùAnd that influence looks set to increase dramatically now that Soros has donated the bulk of his wealth $18 billion into his opensociety pet project, which campaigns for open borders and supranational structures such as the European Union Farage concluded his short, fiery monologue with a weighty statement: I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international, political collusion in history ù On the surface, there seems to be some legitimacy to Farage s claim According to public sources, opensociety European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of opensociety Foundations, met with members of the European Commission on 44 separateoccasionsin 2016 And now that the organization has just been energized with $18 billion, it would seem apparent that that influence is set to increase Moreover, the Soros organizations published a pamphlet providing details on a list of 226 reliable friends ùwho serve in the European Parliament Farage said he would call on the parliament to set up a special committee to investigate the issue In a 177 page pamphletpublishedby opensociety , entitled Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014 2019), ù226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views According to the pamphlet, The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support opensociety s work Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, reliable allies ù of George Soros hold at least one third of seats So what sort of qualifications does an MEP need to be included among opensociety s reliable allies?

they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the orangerevolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, colorrevolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however;

"11 Sep, 2017",Korean nuclear tension: Apocalypse... almost now,"The saber rattling and harsh rhetoric during the current nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula should remind mankind of something we have forgotten Atomic weapons are terrifying things, and talk of using them should be a taboo subject is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London A week or so ago, I found myself reading Agatha Christie s 80th, and penultimate, book, Passenger to Frankfurt, and its relevance to today struck me The book was published in 1970, with the subtitle an extravaganza, ùis an utter failure and was often characterized as an incomprehensible muddle ù; however, this muddle is not due to Christie s old age or senility: instead, its causes are clearly political Passenger to Frankfurt is Christie s most personal, intimately felt, and at the same time most political novel It expresses her personal confusion, her feeling of being totally at a loss with what was going on in the world in the late 1960s the drugs, the sexual revolution, student protests, murders, etc So it s no wonder that Passenger to Frankfurt is not a detective novel There is no murder, no logic, and deduction This feeling of the collapse of the elementary cognitive mapping, this overwhelming fear of chaos, is rendered precisely in Christie s introduction to the novel: Hold up a mirror to 1970 in England Look at that front page every day for a month, make notes, consider and classify Every day there is a killing A girl strangled An elderly woman attacked and robbed of her meager savings Young men or boys attacking or attacked Buildings and telephone kiosks smashed and gutted Drug smuggling Robbery and assault Children missing and children s murdered bodies found not far from their homes Can this be England? Is England really like this? Not yet, but it could be Fear is awakening, a fear of what may be And not only in our own country There are smaller paragraphs on other pages giving news from Europe, from Asia, from the Americas, in Worldwide News Hi jacking of planes Kidnapping Violence Riots Hate Anarchy All growing stronger All seeming to lead to worship of destruction, pleasure in cruelty What does it all mean? ù Is our era with † leaders ù †like Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? So what does all this mean? In the novel, Christie provides her answer a terrible worldwide conspiracy which has something to do with Richard Wagner and The Young Siegfried We learn that, toward the end of World War II, Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war He then escaped to Argentina where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel The Young Siegfried ùMeanwhile, in the book s present, drugs, promiscuity, and student protests are all secretly caused by Nazi agitators who want to bring about anarchy so that they can restore Nazi domination on a world scale This terrible worldwide conspiracy ùis, of course, ideological fantasy at its purest: a weird condensation of the fear of extreme right and extreme left The least we can say to Christie s credit is that she locates the heart of the conspiracy to the extreme right (neo Nazis) and not in any of the other usual suspects (Communism, Jews, Muslims, etc ) The idea neo Nazis were behind the 68 student protesters and sexual liberation struggle, with its obvious madness, nonetheless bears witness to the disintegration of a consistent cognitive mapping of our predicament Christie is compelled to take refuge in such a crazy paranoiac construct as the only way to introduce some order and meaning into the utter confusion and panic she found herself in But is her vision really too crazy to be taken seriously? Is our era with leaders ùlike Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? Our situation is messy in a way very similar to the one described by Christie: a rightist government enforcing workers rights (in Poland), a leftist government pursuing the strictest austerity politics (in Greece) Thus, it s no wonder that, to regain a minimal cognitive mapping, Christie resorts to WWII, the last good war, ùretranslating our mess into its coordinates One should nonetheless note how the very form of Christie s answer (one big secret agent behind it all) strangely mirrors the fascist idea of the Jewish conspiracy: how there is one big Nazi plot behind which lies the explanation to everything And, today, the extreme populist right proposes a similar explanation of the Muslim immigrant threat ùIn antisemitic imaginary, the Jew ùis the invisible master who secretly pulls the strings, which is why Muslim immigrants are NOT today s Jews: they are all too visible, not invisible They are clearly not integrated into our societies, and nobody claims they secretly pull strings if one sees in their invasion of Europe ùa secret plot, then Jews have to be behind it As was the case in a text that recently appeared in one of the main Slovenian Rightist weekly journals where we could read: George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time, ùresponsible for the invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU as a typical Talmudo Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of Western civilization, the nation state and white, European man ù His goal is to build a rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work hating cultural Marxists, ùwhich would then perform a deconstruction of the nation state, and transform the EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe ùFurthermore, Soros is inconsistent in his promotion of multiculturalism: He promotes it exclusively in Europe and the USA, while in the case of Israel, he, in a way which is for me totally justified, agrees with its monoculturalism, latent racism and building a wall In contrast to the EU and USA, he also does not demand from Israel to open its borders and accept refugees A hypocrisy appropriate to Talmudo Zionism ù[Quoted from Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç, George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time (in Slovene), Demokracija, August 25 2016, p 15 ] Is this disgusting fantasy which brings together antisemitism and Islamophobia so different from the one staged by Christie? Are they both not a desperate attempt to orient oneself in confused times? The extreme oscillations in the public perception of the Korean crisis are significant as such One week we are told we are on the brink of nuclear war, then there is a week of respite, then the war threat explodes again When I visited Seoul in August 2017, my friends there told me there is no significant threat of a war since the North Korean regime knows it cannot survive it, but now the South Korean authorities are preparing the population for a nuclear war In such a situation, where the apocalypse is on the horizon, one should bear in mind the standard logic of probability no longer applies, we need a different logic, described by Jean Pierre Dupuy: The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as destiny, for sure, but also as a contingent accident if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example, it could not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not occur, it is not inevitable It is thus the event s actualization the fact that it takes place which retroactively creates its necessity ù[ Jean Pierre Dupuy, Petite metaphysique des tsunami, Paris: Seuil 2005, p 19 ] Dupuy provides the example of the French presidential elections in May 1995; here is the January forecast of the main polling Institute: If on next May 8th, Mr (√âdouard) Balladur will be elected, one can say the presidential election was decided before it even took place ù The moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities When applied to the recent tension in Korea, this means: IF the war explodes, it will be necessary and inevitable; IF war will not explode, it was all a false alarm This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of nuclear (or ecological) catastrophe: not to realistically ùappraise the possibilities of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on the background of this acceptance, we should mobilize ourselves to perform the act which will change destiny itself and thereby insert a new possibility into the situation Instead of saying the future is still open, we still have the time to act and prevent the worst, ù one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable, and then work to undo what is already written in the stars ùas our destiny What is needed is no less than a new global anti nuclear movement, a global mobilization that would exert pressure on nuclear powers and act aggressively, organizing mass protests and boycotts, while denouncing our leaders as criminals and the like It should focus not only on North Korea but also on those super powers who assume the right to monopolize nuclear weapons The very public mention of the use of nuclear weapons should be treated as a criminal offense And more than that, a global change in our stance is needed, what Peter Sloterdijk calls the domestication of the wild animal culture ù Till now, each culture disciplined and educated its own members and guaranteed civic peace among them in the guise of state power, but the relationship between different cultures and states was permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each state of peace nothing more than a temporary armistice As Hegel conceptualized it, the entire ethic of a state culminates in the highest act of heroism, the readiness to sacrifice one s life for one s nation state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within a state Is today s North Korea with its ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons, and rockets to deliver them to distant targets, not the ultimate example of this logic of unconditional nation state sovereignty? However, the moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities A task rendered all the more difficult by the ongoing rise of sectarian religious and ethnic heroic ùviolence and readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one s specific cause The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/402959-korean-nuclear-christie-apocalypse-zizek/

The question answers itself, though not for reasons Western liberals will likely accept In the interests of accuracy let us be clear: it is not the West, it is Western liberalism that is in crisis The two entities are distinct and indeed, as events have and continue to prove, completely antithetical to one another The first paragraph of theMSC reportreads as if the end of the world is upon us The world is facing an illiberal moment Across the West and beyond, illiberal forces are gaining ground From within, Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal democratic status quo From outside, Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises with Syria as the prime example ù #Assad: US Russia cooperation could benefit Syria & wider worldhttps:// tdotco /G8xOCEeI9B Implied in this statement is the assumption that liberalism, or liberal values, should be considered sacrosanct, the sine qua non of cultural, political, economic and moral virtue, and as such the values according to which every country, society, and people must exist, regardless of cultural, regional, or historical specificities Therein lies the problem Despite the carnage, chaos, instability, conflict without end, societal collapse, and economic dislocation that has been wrought in the name of those very sacrosanct liberal values and liberal democracy in recent times, its proponents continue to live in a state of abject denial Try telling the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Africa, Latin America, who ve seen their countries and societies destroyed in service to liberal democracy, about this illiberal moment ù they are meant to fear Try telling the ever and shamefully increasing number of victims of poverty, lack of education, poor housing, bad or non existent healthcare provision in Western countries, where liberal values predominate, about them also And when it comes to Syria, cited in the report as evidence of a security crisis ùwhich Western states seem unwilling and unable to effectively tackle, ùhave these people no shame? The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al Qaeda against the US in 2001 In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term Western civilization Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: Donald Trump s comments about NATO being obsolete ù have caused great uncertainty among America s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe The European Union is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia ù Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change i e in the former Yugoslavia and Libya It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal democratic values and norms have wrought In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests As George Orwell wrote, War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength ù No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem What they describe as a revisionist Russia ùis really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony Replace revisionist ùwith strong, ùand you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017 They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society Russia s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/377466-munich-security-trump-russia-eu/

Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September That s an inner German situation There s another situation coming from our West European neighbors We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social Democratic Party no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social Democratic Party SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse SS:Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War SS:Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President SS:Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality SS:Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population SS:Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment SS:There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems SS:Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/
"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety , limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The opensociety Institute (OSI) and opensociety Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the European Union, going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt ‚Äì Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough The nation s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign backed NGOs operating in the country The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it s great to have you here on our program, welcome Peter Szijjart√≥:My pleasure, thank you SS:So, we ll start with the latest: † Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros † I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that How dangerous are those organisations for your country? PS:Actually, there s a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country which is a very dangerous approach, because it s not true There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would ve run, so there were no people voting for I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me People vote on politicians, on political parties So it s the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous number one Number two, you know, there s a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it s not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent So, that s why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments then it should be known to the people SS:Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with local groups despite government s opposition PS:What we say is that they have to be transparent People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics then these people have to know, whom these are representing That s what we want to know SS:Well, who are they? PS:We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary He has a very clear, let s say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn t like our approach, doesn t like our policies But, it s not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it s the Hungarian people We find it very anti democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for SS:But when George Soros says that more than ever he s going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he s going to go against the government s will How s that going to play out? PS:He has a very clear intention, that s definitely true, but I think it s an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence This is what we have heard a lot from the U S , for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country So, it s a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors people, persons, businessmen of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves SS:If you re saying you re going after NGOs, you can t just go after Soros funded NGOs, you ll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well Are you ready to do that? PS:My position is that we have to ensure level playing field So, double standards we don t like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by Actually, it s I wouldn t say funny because it s too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter N is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family so, actually, I don t think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non governmental organisation is too much SS:So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country s foreign policy? PS:I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life social, political life of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are SS:But here s a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros funded NGOs, before they came to power so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? PS:Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad in the U S and in the UK But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things SS:Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe do you think with him in the office it s going to be easier for Hungary to get rid of these Soros foundation NGOs in your country? PS:What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points There were very clear attempts from the U S to interfere in our internal issues Just to give you an example, I was given a two page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S as a foreign minister This two pager contained some measures which the U S government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship but, come on! I mean, it s too much, it s interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary Although our economic and defence military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve SS:We re going to talk about U S Hungary relationship in just a bit Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? PS:What I understand from my colleagues, since I don t supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations SS:What s the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? PS:Since I m not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard SS:I spoke to Ex president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus † and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe Why are they still so supportive of this open door policy? What do you think? PS:I wouldn t speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015 I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there s no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there s war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia So, why the EU carries out this open door policy? You should ask the high ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy It s harming the EU, it s dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU we don t even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not † but if you speak like this, you re going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that migration equals terrorism , which you ve never said But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe SS:I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter argument for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested if I m correct a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren t refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it s a homegrown thing PS:It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there s a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are with opening green borders to them, saying please come on in , without controlling them does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been double societies or parallel societies constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies We have to speak about this openly We think that this solution based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it s totally against common sense We have to be able to protect ourselves We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that SS:So let s talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey Luxembourg s Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that Aren t you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? PS:No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary we are a Schengen member state, so if there s a decision that a number of ex migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country number one Number two it s against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they re going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx And, number three, it s breaking European regulations These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling SS:Just because this open door policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr Orban, comes out and says bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide I m thinking, maybe, it s a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a national suicide ? PS:There are tricks in that First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don t oblige So, † these are tricks, and it s very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don t want it SS:You ve turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren t the only one there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls Is this the only way, to put up fences? PS:We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there s a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders according to regulation But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you re located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours it even said, during opening hours ! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia so no Schengen member states There s no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations! then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly So, it s tragic, I ll say SS:Are you pro Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? PS:We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it s a suicide for the European economy European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting sequence and adjusting type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone That s what we have been working on, and that s why we don t like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you re accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming SS:You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe s security, especially Germany is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? PS:Very minimum The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it s not true, because we have border crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country † of course, respecting the regulations When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower Only three countries SS:Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really goes against all European , but he s still willing to take the risk How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? PS:There s a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately Because of European regulations † you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our † perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal SS:I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington do you think Orban s friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary s relations with the EU? PS:I don t think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he s the President of the U S , and I see that there s a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it s not them, it s not liberal Western media, it s not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who s going to be the President of the U S I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him as such a progressive, such a † wonderful, such a smart guy !, but because it s Donald Trump, now he s bashed in every sentence, which I don t think would be fair and correct Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it s American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar † to his position SS:And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti establishment forces, may not win this elections do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? PS:There s a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it s no wonder these are challenging times There s a kind of fight or debate between two camps sovereignists and federalists We say we belong to the sovereignists, of course that European Union can only be strong if the member states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union The only question is how to get there? Our position is that only strong member states can lead to a strong European Union SS:My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy they don t want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S , these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe PS:We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn t want to break the European unity but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well SS:Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview Good luck with everything PS:Thank you RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/
"19 Jan, 2017",‚ÄòStop Operation Soros‚Äô movement begins in Macedonia,"A new initiative, Stop Operation Soros (SOS), dedicated to countering the influence of American billionaire activist George Soros, has been launched in Macedonia In a press conference on Tuesday, the founders of the group called on all free minded citizens, ù regardless of ethnicity or religion, to join them in the fight against one mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by George Soros, ù the Vecer newspaper reported The movement says it will first focus on uncovering subversive activities by Soros funded NGOs According to Nikola Srbov, a columnist for pro government news portal Kurir and co founder of SOS, Soros funded NGOs have monopolized civilsociety in Macedonia and used their position to suppress dissenting views We ve witnessed the takeover of the entire civil sector and its abuse and instrumentalization to meet the goals of one political party That is unacceptable and goes beyond the principles of civic organizing, ùSrbovsaidat the press conference The opensociety Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, used its funding and personnel to support violent processes in Macedonia It has monopolized the civilsociety sector, pushing outside any organization which disagrees with the Soros ideology, ùhe stated Another co founder, Cvetin Cilimanov, editor in chief of the state run MIA news agency, accused Soros s opensociety Foundations of undermining Macedonian sovereignty by working not only with the opposition center left SDSM party, but also with outside interests By cooperating with foreign embassies and organizations such as USAID, Cilimanov believes Soros backed groups have interfered in the political process of Macedonia This is unacceptable and has largely contributed to a feeling in the public that the traditional relations of partnership Macedonia enjoyed with some countries are being undermined, ùCilimanovtoldjournalists A third founder of the initiative and editor in chief of the Republika news portal, Nenad Mircevski, declared that the group would work towards the de Soros ization ù of Macedonia, echoing a speech made by former prime minister and leader of the ruling VMRO DPMNE party Nikola Gruevski in December In the speech, Gruevski accused foreign powers and Soros backed organizations of meddling in Macedonian politics Opposition figures have expressed concern at the rhetoric used by Gruevski, fearing the start of a crackdown on dissent and advocacy groups The opensociety Foundation (OSF) was set up by Hungarian born Soros between the mid 1980s to early 1990s with the stated aim of helping former Eastern bloc countries transition from communism However, aside from its support for progressive causes such as drug policy reform, the OSF has also been involved in political activities and Soros publically supported the violent overthrow of the legitimately elected government in Ukraine during the Euromaidan revolution This has earned him the ire of Russian authorities, which in 2015 banned Soros and his foundations as a threat to national security Soros and his foundations have come under scrutiny elsewhere as well In an interview with the internet portal 888 hu in December, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that 2017 would bring about the extrusion of George Soros and the forces symbolized by him ùOrban has accused Soros of undermining European borders and values by helping facilitate the flow of refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere During a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), WikiLeaks Julian Assange also blasted the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, funded by Soros, for focusing exclusively on negative stories about Russia and former Soviet states ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/374241-stop-operation-soros-movement-macedonia/

"7 Jan, 2017",George Soros‚Äô world is falling apart ‚Äì and he blames everyone but himself,"George Soros, the Hungarian born billionaire who has meddled in politics across Europe and North America for decades, is angry The world he campaigned for is falling apart, and now he s busy looking for leaders to indict Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv According toSoros, liberal democracy is failing all across the western world Apparently, this is because what he calls the opensociety ù is in crisis Now, he may very well be right about this, but pinning it on Angela Merkel seems somewhat bizarre Especially when she is painted as being inadvertently in league with Vladimir Putin But, nevertheless, it s the German chancellor he regards as most culpable for why voters have become disenchanted with modern democracy Writing in a widely published New Year op ed, Soros traces the current European crisis back to the crash of 2008 He laments how Germany emerged as the hegemonic power in Europe, but it failed to live up to the obligations that successful hegemons must fulfill, namely looking beyond their narrow self interest to the interests of the people who depend on them ù Then he harks back to the 1940 s Compare the behavior of the US after WWII with Germany s behavior after the Crash of 2008, ù he observes The US launched the Marshall Plan, which led to the development of the EU; Germany imposed an austerity program that served its narrow self interest ù Russophrenia: Western elites ignore their own citizens anger and blame Russia instead (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /h5UohS2ceE This is very unfair to Berlin The difference here is that the Marshall Plan followed the most destructive war humanity has ever known, and the US was not practicing pure benevolence either It was acting in naked self interest, because it feared all of Europe turning communist And despite Marxist Moscow helping to win the conflict, it was abundantly clear that the USSR and the US would compete for global domination in the new world order of the time Thus, the US was creating a buffer zone against the Soviets and bolstering allies it would need for its own protection, and for the maintenance of the capitalist system it promoted Germany s situation in 2008 was rather different Berlin was not seeking to become a global superpower, and the public was not pushing for it either Also, there was no ideology in play, other than a belief that countries should live within their means Furthermore, Germany had recently completed a costly reunification, and its economy was only returning to growth after a decade of near stagnation For the average German in 2008, the last thing on their mind was becoming Europe s hegemonic power Soros attack on Germany is probably borne out of personal frustration over Merkel s lack of willingness to push for further European integration Yet, this policy is merely a reflection of what her electorate wants Miserly Germans are unable to countenance financially supporting profligate southern Europeans As a result, the Euro currency project, which Merkel s predecessor Helmut Kohl was basically forced into by France, has always had a questionable long term future Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants #GeorgeSoros(Op Ed by Sam Gerrans)https:// tdotco /Kgqh4ICNxGpic twitter com/3HC9l5tljI If we believe Soros back story (and many have questioned it), he pushes liberal democracy for perfectly valid reasons The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler s Germany in 1944, ù he writes Later, of course, this regime was replaced with a totalitarian communist system before he fled Budapest in 1947 In his op ed, Soros tells us that his experiences in Britain and the United States taught him how open societies ù are the only ones which guarantee the safety of their people Indeed, the Hungarian may be right about this However, where he has long failed is in understanding the reasons why some countries are not ready for the kind of liberalism he espouses Let s remember how hechuckedmillions of dollars into pro western movements inUkraine A man born and raised in neighboring Hungary should have been well aware of how divided the country was, and known that his actions could lead to turmoil Especially given that his homeland has a stake in the southwestern part, where Hungarian is often the spoken language Yet, he ploughed ahead, and his actions helped to destroy the country The billionaire now says the only explanation I can find (for the electorate s rejection of globalization/liberalism) is that elected leaders failed to meet voters legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy ù Yes, this is really George Soros writing The same George Soros who attends Davos every year Because, were looking for a symbol of where the elites and the plebs most diverge, it would probably be at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain commune Where the rulers of the world look down on us mere mortals from the highest town in Europe (at 1,560 meters) Davos is the problem, not the solution (Op Edge by@NeilClark66)https:// tdotco /bwKAWPhSx5pic twitter com/49L7oGSMKq But Soros then decides to pin a large part of the blame on a figure who has never been much of a cheerleader for Davos Merkel And he goes on to predict the demise of the EU itself With economic growth lagging and the refugee crisis out of control, the EU is on the verge of breakdown and is set to undergo an experience similar to that of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s ù The reason for the EU s impending doom is apparently the 2017 election cycle, where the contests in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France will be key In the latter, the two leading contenders [Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon] are close to Putin and eager to appease him, ù according to Soros French people sacrifice their own interests to help Putin win the world? (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /qctrsI5Dtn So, now we are finally on to Putin Soros feels that if either Le Pen or Fillon wins, Putin s dominance of Europe will become a fait accompli ù He writes: I am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of opensociety ù This is because Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about ù Put plainly, the notion that Putin somehow engineered the French election to organize a contest between Fillon and Le Pen (which is still not guaranteed) is preposterous But this is the trauma filled world Soros now inhabits And he goes on to make another ridiculous statement: In a brilliant move, he [Putin] exploited social media companies business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies That is how he helped Trump get elected ù In other words, Soros thinks Putin manipulated Facebook and Twitter to win the US election for Trump This argument is ridiculous and makes Soros look stupid It also suggests that he s throwing his rattle out of the pram because a few democratic decisions have gone against him And he needs to denigrate Merkel and use Putin as a bogeyman in order to deflect any mud from himself But lets look at the reality here Soros strongly opposed George W Bush s presidency He funded the Move On project and threwmillionsuponmillionsat theDemocratic Party What this interference did was help remove them from their working class base and transform them into a globalist party, which now seems to win only in coastal metropolitan areas Shorn of a need to fund raise to the same extent as before, leftists used Soros money to focus on identity politics , which alienates the white working class And that same blue collar group voted overwhelmingly for Trump this fall For his own part, Soros, ironically at Davos,predictedthat Trump had no chance of being elected president And he was wrong Now it appears he can t deal with the outcome Perhaps because he feels his life s work is slipping away The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/372921-soros-eu-democracy-putin-merkel/

"18 Dec, 2016",Facebook‚Äôs 'anti-fake news' plan looks like effort to curb alternative media,"There are serious concerns over a social media giant s plans to debunk spurious news stories And many are puzzled about the real agenda at play Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv You don t need to worship at the altar of George Orwell to see where this is going Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as fake news on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it s proposed to implement it merits many questions Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country s popular press But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg s firm is an effective monopoly CIA meddled in hundreds of elections: Ron Paul talks Russia blaming, fake news and more on RThttps:// tdotco /qxttAcpYSmpic twitter com/1kd44g8AVH Whereas papers have always been curated by editors, their power was limited by the sheer number of competitors in every national market And the more different they were, the better for society in general However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary Of course, another big problem here is that one person s fake news ùcould be another s truth And that s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self proclaimed international fact checking network, ùwhich presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing They include Pierre Omidyar,George Sorosand Washington s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft power cutout As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine s Maidan coup in 2014 Thus, it s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of ministry of truth ùwith only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook s primary news feeds And this is very dangerous Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact checkers to sort out fake news https:// tdotco /jZmZXrpl06pic twitter com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling Because it s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices That said, nobody is disputing whether fake news ùis a problem It s just hard to find agreement on its definition For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it s often a different story Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked bynumerouscrediblesources And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging thatVladimir Putinwas using kompromat ùto destroy the reputations of his political opponents For proof they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography German politicians want 500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrshttps:// tdotco /VSGNiA2M98pic twitter com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper s readers were greeted with this soft soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins: His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K G B and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride ùAnd to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes Yet, sadly for Higgins and Bukovsky, of course his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child pornimageshimself, as research Then there s theGuardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune without any explanation suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the sameWashington Post These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source And we can t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of alove childand Moscow developing a Star Trek esqueteleportation device Are all these not examples of fake news? ùBut given that they are establishment names in the western press, don t expect Poynter to subject them to the same treatment as newer alternative outlets And this is the problem with the entire exercise Credible or fake? Journalists clash in fiery RT debate on news sources in#Syria(VIDEO)https:// tdotco /ibunqPmH1Vpic twitter com/qLtwXN45j7 The list of signatories to the InternationalFact CheckingNetwork also sets alarm bells ringing For they include some fairly dubious organizations TakePolitifact, for example This group has been accused of having a left wing bias and openly favoring Clinton during the US election campaign As Breitbart observed: When Trump said Clinton wants open borders, ù PolitiFact deemed his statement mostly false ù î despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013 My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, ù she said at the time ù Intolerable & dangerous :#AuschwitzCommittee accuses#Facebookof turning blind eye to hate speechhttps:// tdotco /GGY63iSnbTpic twitter com/YKcwlOujvk There is no doubt that blatantly made up, let alone poorly fact checked, stories are poisoning political discourse And Facebook is right to tackle the type of companies who produce twaddle such as Hillary invented the Aids virus ùor Trump wants to distribute Mein Kampf to school kids or whatever nonsense is being pushed today However, will it also censure respected ùmainstream outlets who allege that Putin has stolen $200 billion for himself or is planting child porn on dissidents? Because unless they are also labelled with the fake news ùbadge, this looks more like an exercise in the US liberal establishment trying to gain control of the distribution of news on social media, as they once did with newspapers and broadcasters Orwell might have called it a sort of Minitrue ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/370678-democracy-fake-news-facebook/
"30 Nov, 2016",Saving Poroshenko? US State Dept offers $800k to Ukraine NGOs,"Washington is offering a grant of up to $800,000 to Ukrainian public organizations that will monitor regional authorities and secure ties with local media Political analysts say it s a way to keep President Petro Poroshenko in power amid declining popularity [The] goal is to enhance the accountability and responsiveness of the Ukrainian government at the local level through civilsociety advocacy, monitoring, and civic activism, ùreads a US State Department funding announcement, published this week on thegrants govwebsite It explains further that the State Department is looking for civilsociety organizations, ùeither non profit or for profit (with some conditions) that will provide proposals to perform a watchdog function and advocate for democratic governance ùin Ukraine The description states the program is aimed at increasing civic activism in Ukraine at a local level and building and training a network of civic activists throughout the country These in turn are to keep watch on the activities of local governments and encourage partnerships between civilsociety and media to communicate important information about local reforms to the public ù The organizations applying for the grant must present a program for their activities, along with a financial plan, by January 17, 2017 They are also required to have ties with thematic or in country partners, entities and relevant stakeholders, including private sector partners and NGOs ùand provide proof of these links or their potential development The description states that applicants are also requested to have demonstrable experience in administering successful, and preferably similar, projects ù It adds that: Projects should have the potential to have an immediate impact leading to long term sustainable reforms, and should have potential for sustainability beyond DRL (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor of the State Department) resources ù READ MORE: †Ukrainian Maidan coup leaders must testify before court ousted President Yanukovich Among other things, the bureau says it welcomes projects that advance the rights and uphold the dignity of the most vulnerable or at risk populations, ù with one of the criteria for the selection of candidates being their cooperation with minority groups The State Department reserves a significant role for itself in the implementation of the program that receives the grant It will, for instance, demand quarterly reports on the program s spending and progress Experts believe that this and other such funding opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko The Ukrainian leader s public approval ratings have plunged recently According toLiga Net, in November Poroshenko s rating drew 14 3 percent of popular support having plummeted to a low of 10 7 percent in summer He is still behind former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections, ù Shlyamin believes He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko s leadership, with his promises to introduce visa free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption proving a failure Under Poroshenko, Ukraine has so far been unable to secure European Union and NATO membership In domestic policy [there have been] also continuous failures, ùShlyamin told RT Russian He believes the current grant is one of the final efforts by US President Barack Obama s administration to maintain US Ukraine relations as they have been since the coup in 2014 Obama will soon leave office Therefore, he needs to have time to allocate the necessary financial resources to continue the current policy and prevent future president Donald Trump from building a new line of cooperation with Ukraine, ùhe says Some, like film director Oliver Stone, have called the Maidan revolution of 2014 aUS staged coup, while former US Congressman Ron Paulcalledon foreign actors like Washington, NATO or Moscow to stay out of the country READ MORE: †Coups for export: US has history of supporting anti govt upheavals In 2015, Sputnik news agency reported that the National Endowment for Democracy

major grant like the one currently being advertised for Ukraine is likely to end up in the hands of someone trusted by Washington, such as billionaire investor George Soros The government must be sure of the loyalty of those who are entrusted with such projects After all, their goal [is] espionage and site preparation for the implementation of pro American policy, ù he said Experts say that under Obama, Washington has been striving to gain full control over Ukraine a strategically important region due to its location close to Russia Shlyamin noted that in this struggle for Kiev, ù Washington

"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro Clinton supporter In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton s particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4 8 years of US led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton s War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes, What s the point of having this superb military if we can t use it? And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq which was half a million dead Iraqi children was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded, We think the price is worth it Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball: Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government But it is already clear that Russia s intervention in our election on Trump s side is the real scandal of 2016 Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia s (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the real scandal of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange s torturous, slow drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind boggling list of poor decision making The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics, Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans nothing to look at here, please move on Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton s chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump s victory chances on Nov 8th And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC †chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton Trump CNN hosted debate The jaw dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate style investigation By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either But that s mere child s play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad Clinton s leaky emails point to the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of †ISIS †of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including †ISIS, that s there in those emails, the WikiLeaks co founder said There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone, he added Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of collateral damage in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We ll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers ù Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich as opposed to Russia was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr Rich ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered îat dawn îas he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild conspiracy theories, yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about Russian involvement in the WikiLeaks Although it may be perfectly true that Mr Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government îthe Russians When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America s global military footprint if elected president, neo conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American style fascism Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals like George W Bush and, yes, Barack Obama who pledge to continue America s wars of expansion and empire Clinton s past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to Make America Great Again Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures Assange òsorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t co/6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A Mussomeli in the Washington Post, of all places really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump: Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al Assad in Syria, are frightened But what really troubles them is [Trump s] generally level headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs †Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep s clothing î just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf s clothing Anne Applebaum, perennial anti Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange s work with groundless accusations: Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen Philip Breedlove †and probably others The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U S democratic process and, again, the elite ù who supposedly run it Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum s diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess Albright claimed that Russia seeks to undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr Assange, the value of that statement for themselves So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton s rat infested ship once and for all We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365545-madeleine-albright-clinton-neocon/

America is not some kind of † banana republic , after all, but is a †great power Do correct me if I †am wrong ù Reality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency Anthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton linked US mainstream mediaacknowledginghow Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of philantro capitalism ù(actually a money laundering pay to play ùracket), a practice by no means confined to the Clintons ù And the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary beingperfectly awarethat prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations all three of them Exhibit A is †thisWikiLeaks bombshell; Peter Kadzik, who s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton s right hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset Process has begun :#FBIscouring 650k emails on#Clintonaide s laptop in reopened casehttps:// tdotco /l6cThxdWv1pic twitter com/oPmgO2WJzI Not only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta as also revealed by WikiLeaks thanked Kadzik for keeping him out of jail ù; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secretheads upon the Clinton email investigation The Clinton machine, starring a self described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business Huma and her family s close connections to Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi) Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that s part of the Clinton Foundation connection Yet now, with Huma in the spotlight still maintaining she didn t know all those emails were in her and Wiener s laptop it s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to one of my aides ù She used to beHillary s ersatz daughter ù; now she s being framed as The Fall Princess And that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener s sexting of minors The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now Let s try to cut a long story short Last July, the DOJ under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate And yet FBI director Comey who nonetheless stressed Hillary s extreme carelessness ù turbo charged his no denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe ù Soon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation The East District of New York refused it Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch Enter an extra layer of legalese Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements But then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner s sexting of a 15 year old girl Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts fromHumaabedin@yahoo comto the crucialhuma@clintonemail com †This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the secret ùclintonemail com to Huma at yahoo com No one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements What s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined Now picture both teams of FBI investigators Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener comparing notes And then they decide Huma s emails are relevant ù BREAKING:#PodestaEmails25: WikiLeaks releases latest batch of Clinton emailshttps:// tdotco /5Xe0ziOAdFpic twitter com/D8R12iQUFX Key questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed relevant ùif the investigators could only examine the metadata What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails a potential game changer That s why one of my sourcesinsistshis decision to go public came from above The other key question now is whether the DOJ via Kadzik? will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation Senior, serious FBI agents won t take that massive euphemism kindly The FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence and they won t quit Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton s Bonfire of Scandals problems The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365204-clinton-us-investigation-justice/
"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European 'forced migration',"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called colorrevolution s, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps:// tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the opensociety Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety , we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/

"22 Jul, 2016",Welcome to the circus of US political conventions,"Annual party convention season in the United States combines comedy, farce, and melodrama in one rip roaring package of unadulterated entertainment that is to democracy what the Emperor Nero was to fire prevention The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard waving, holler whooping people bused in from every town in the country Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy eyed patriot boasts In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was Lock her up!

"9 Apr, 2016",Why Sitting Bull was right about Washington‚Äôs lack of integrity,"That integrity is a foreign land where Washington is concerned is an inarguable fact In the latest example, the failure to complete the construction of a nuclear disposal plant agreed with Russia once again leaves Washington s credibility in tatters Underlying this issue is the attempt by the US federal government to alter the terms of theagreementit signed with Russia in 2000 for the disposal of weapons grade plutonium, with each country building industrial plants with this specific objective in mind Russia has kept its side of the bargain and, at no small cost, built the facility required to dispose of its excess nuclear material in the manner agreed The US on the other hand is now looking at an alternative method of disposal, which amounts to storing said material in a process that allows it to retain its breakout potential ù i e its ability to be converted back into weapons grade plutonium Not what we agreed on : Processing method swap violates US Russian plutonium dealhttps:// tdotco /kePBWpIv3qpic twitter com/EA3MiCeGWl Given the record of subterfuge and double dealing on the part of successive US governments when it comes to its failure to honour treaties and agreements, nobody should be surprised Indeed, this subterfuge is so common where Washington is concerned that you could be forgiven for considering it a quintessentially American trait Since 2000 alone, the record in this regard makes stark reading The willfully false assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of WMD, for example, was used as justification for one of the most disastrous wars ever unleashed, certainly in modern times, which only succeeded in plunging Iraq and the wider entire region into a dark night of terrorism and sectarian bloodletting It is a state of affairs that shows no evidence of abating anytime soon, 13 years later Following on from that, when Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, he did so as the supposed antidote to the arrogance and mendacity that typified the Bush years before him One of his very first pledges upon taking office was that he would close of the controversial US prison facility, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, during his first term in office It was a pledge and an announcement that met with support across the world, given that along with rendition, waterboarding and torture, the very name Guantanamo conjured up his predecessor s war on terror, ù which replaced international law with might is right as the cornerstone of global affairs Yet despite Obama s pledge, 15 years later Guantanamo remains in operation Behind its bars 37 inmates, denied the right to due process, continue to be held in a state of legal limbo Compounding the scandal of this US military prison facility is the fact it exists on Cuba s sovereign territory despite repeated demands by the Cuban government for it to be returned More recently, we have had the scandal of thePanama Papers, containing evidence of mass and wholesale financial and tax impropriety by leading politicians, corporate executives and the super rich However, an even bigger story has been the politicization of the information contained within these papers throughout the Western media, involving a transparent attempt to smear Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, even though neither his name nor the name of any member of his family appears anywhere in them This is no surprise considering that the misnamed International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), based in Washington, is the body responsible for leaking the information to the media The ICIJ is the international arm of the US Center for Public Integrity, an organization that counts among its major donors George Soros s opensociety Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and the Carnegie Endowment, among others This has to explain why out of all the people whose names have been leaked thus far there are conspicuously few American citizens among them Do they really expect us to believe that the US is immune to financial corruption? Really? Wall Street, the global financial crisis, the land of corporate greed and malfeasance, yet up to now not one major name from the world of politics, business, or banking is included within the Panama Papers? With this in mind, it really doesn t take a genius to discern the agenda being pursued here This brings us back to this latest example of US bad faith and lack of integrity when it comes to fulfilling its agreements and international obligations vis √† vis Russia By now, Moscow should be accustomed to being lied to by Washington Whether it is the assurances given to the last Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev that upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union there would be no eastward expansion of NATO, which were not kept, or the manipulation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 to effect regime change in Libya by NATO, time and again the US government, either unilaterally or via Washington controlled international bodies, has proved that not only its word but its official stamp on treaties and agreements is meaningless In this regard, the words of none other than Sitting Bull have proved eerily prescient over the generations since the great Indian warrior chief uttered them There are things they tell us that sound good to hear, but when they have accomplished their purpose they will go home and will not try to fulfill our agreements with them Sitting Bull s analysis of Washington and its integrity has stood the test of time ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/339039-plutonium-us-russia-deal-panama/

individuals Washington surely wouldn t want to see affected Furthermore, the leaks also put into the spotlight the turbo globalist, elite friendly economic system designed not in Russia, but by self styled free marketers in the US and Britain in the 1970s A Pandora s Box has been opened by the Panama leaks and ironically given the ICIJ and the OCCRP s funding it s billionaire global capitalists like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash Here s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super rich as elite friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005 Last October, Oxfamrevealedthat half the world s wealth was in the hands of just one percent of the population The Panama leaks, described by whistleblower Edward Snowden as the biggest leak in the history of data journalism, ùshow us how the global super rich exploit the current system still further to keep their wealth away from the taxman and get even richer at our expense And what the revelations make clear is that the super rich wouldn t be able to do this without the help of banks, lawyers, accountants and other intermediaries who most clearly do not act in the public interest British neocons and Sorosian liberals who no doubt gloated over Monday s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes

"24 Mar, 2016",America faces its moment of Trump,"The meteoric rise of Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner who is giving the Establishment 3D nightmares, is the natural outcome of a political system that has been arrogantly ignoring the will of the American electorate for many years Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge What started off as cheap comic fodder for late night television, and later ignored by the elite as an unfortunate yet containable nuisance, has now exploded on the scene as a destructive force of nature capable of blowing away the Establishment s corporate owned power structure Yes, we are talking about The Donald, a Category 5 political hurricane that is expected to cause major devastation should it touchdown in the Beltway So anxious are the Democrats (and Republicans!) to contain the mighty Trump they will even deny his First Amendment right to address his supporters Yes, while many Americans travel great distances at their own expense to listen to Trump s white hot political message, perennial provocateur George Soros must pay his puppets to erect roadblocks and hoist placards to deny free passage to the venues Who says freedom loving, liberal activists lack a sense of irony? Trump on Putin s compliment: Great honor https:// tdotco /WPsiSWKYQApic twitter com/2WmfxnGvsn Last week, for example, demonstrations in Chicago organized by the Soros funded MoveOn org group forced Trump to cancel a speaking engagement Later, on March 20, members of the same subversive outfitblocked trafficnear a Trump event in Arizona, while police in New York City the same day pepper sprayed demonstrators, some of whom are affiliated with violent anarchist groups And then there s the corporate owned media, which, instead of impartially and dispassionately reporting on Trump s rising star, is working on behalf of its owners to knock it out of the sky Here is a random CNN smearpiece, which opens with the angst ridden line: Anti Trump Republicans desperate to stop the billionaire from being their nominee are discussing creative ways to halt his momentum ùSo the story now is not about the millions of Americans who support Trump s political ideas, nor even discussing what those ideas might be, but rather about how the racist, misogynist, sexist outsider must be stopped Consider these two competing lines from another CNNarticle, and how they work to manipulate the mind of the reader regarding the boastful ùTrump and the proud ùClinton: Trump repeatedly boasts about the failure of millions of dollars in attack aids to wound his campaign, and insists he is on pace to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination ù While the very next about Clinton reads: Clinton said she was very proud to have won Arizona and hit Republican candidates who she said were literally inciting bigotry and violence ù But it is not just the Democrats and the liberal media working to sabotage Trump s campaign Incredibly, even the Republican Party is plotting against their own frontrunner, as Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox Newsexplained But why would the GOP work against Trump if he represents the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? #HillaryClintonspeaks at#AIPAC2016conference [VIDEO]https:// tdotco /X1yGaBHOvM Pirro nails it with this answer to herself: The Republican establishment are in bed with the Democrats So if Hillary wins, nothing is lost for them It s business as usual The lobbyists keep their offices on K Street, the pharmaceutical companies keep paying them and the lawmakers get their re election bribes I mean, contributions ù Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, when asked to explain the elite s refusal to support Trump, perhaps gave away a bit too much information when hesaid: Well, because he s an outsider, he s not them, he s not part of the club, he s uncontrollable, he hasn t been through the initiation rites, he didn t belong to the secret society ù Initiation rites? Secret societies? Secret handshakes? Did Newt just join ranks with the conspiracy theorists? Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers One of his regular claims aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him Although it is a delicious sight watching America s movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold hearted wretchedness of the dual party, borderline fascist system Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks The Establishment would continue unmolested with its too big to jail banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power Trump s ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they d work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril This polarizing issue largely explains Trump s huge popularity among voters today The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump s political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it Amazing comments from the Pope considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank you very much Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff raff According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US Mexican border But the crazy is just beginning Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing Only the government could script such a narrative But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, ùsaid Garza This right here is border insecurity at its best Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities ù If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right wing parties, I really can t imagine it And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political correct speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from No, sending a message to other would be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W Bush s reckless 8 year war on terror Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it He never explained that decision to the public ù A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be All Americans knew is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job ù Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non consequential 8 year intermission by America s first black president) Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree) I think this is a  great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, ùshe told C Span early last year I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that ù But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America s former shine @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/

"13 Feb, 2016",George Soros: A psychopath‚Äôs psychopath,"According to Soros, Russia s strategy is to avoid collapse by making the EU implode first by exacerbating the migration crisis and stoking Islamophobia ù On February 11,the Guardianran anarticleby George Soros which had run a day earlierhereentitled Putin is a bigger threat to Europe s existence than Isis ù After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order I have met a few psychopaths in my life a pernicious but small time example is a real estate salesman ù in Spain who cost my family a great deal of time and money The real problem with psychopaths big time and small time is not primarily that they do bad things, but that we non psychopaths are ill prepared to deal with the fundamental difference between us and them We people with operational consciences think (wrongly) that everyone is like us We are shackled to the assumption that just because we would not do unspeakably evil things or would be unable to live with ourselves if we did all other people work the same way They do not When a psychopath lies, or steals, or manipulates or does whatever he thinks is required to get what he wants he has no greater emotional connection with his actions than you or I have with yesterday s lunch We, the non psychopaths, tell little lies and do little wrongs But we have a limit beyond which we will not go For the psychopath, scale makes no difference Stealing a family s savings, or crashing an economy, or destroying a country is of no more consequence to the psychopath than deciding not to return ten bucks to a cashier who had made a mistake And no matter what evil the psychopath meticulously plotted and practiced against you, to him, what happens is your fault Always Which brings me back to George Soros Inthe Guardian sarticle, then, Soros claims the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State ù The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writerGear√≥id √ì Colmain, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what √ì Colmain rightly calls a tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite ù In an interview withRT, √ì Colmain said, There is no War on Terror There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies There is no such thing as ISIS ISIS is a creation of the United States ù Soros and his ilk created and benefit from what Soros calls Islamic State, ù yet his argument not only disregards that fact, it kicks blame in the direction of the one major power Russia which has taken steps to deal with this US creation Soros goes on to make a number of other accusations against Russia, failing at any time to note that Russia alone has a mandate from the legitimate government of Syria, or that Russia is seriously engaged in cleaning house in Syria, a job the US was only simulating Acknowledgement of Russia s successes in Syria comes from many quarters, includingSeymour Hersh Hersh is a high profile American journalist, but one incapable of understanding the reasons for US policy towards Syria, bless him Soros next point is that Putin s aim is to foster the EU s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees ù The truth is that Russia s natural ally is Germany and preventing that alliance is the primary aim of the US government at least according toStratfor, a US intelligence agency Germany s efficiency and organizational abilities combined with Russia s raw materials, inventive genius, and good relations with China, is the combination those funding and directing ISIS least want to see By occupying Germany with an army of aggressive, unskilled, culturally insoluble economic migrants from Africa and elsewhere, the chess players at the board of realpolitik are attempting to head off that natural outcome Soros part in destabilizing Europe is well attested The Daily Mailreported back in November 2015 that Soros was busy telling the EU to take at least a million ù refugees every year In the same article, Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is quoted as saying, This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state ù Orban went on, This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros ù Soros described in the article as a funder of pro migration groups all over the world ù responded to Orban s comments by arguing that his beliefs uphold European values ù I don t know what Soros means by European values, ù but I assume it includes lots more immigration for us unilaterally decided upon by Mr Soros As prime minister of Hungary, Orban is a man with, perhaps, better access than most to the truth about George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary the source for which information is his own father s book Masquerade Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary Thus, Soros has moved effortlessly from collaborating with the Nazis against his fellow Jews an occupation (if you will excuse the pun) he makes little effort to hide totellingindigenous European peoples what the ethnic make up of their countries should be He was also instrumental in the destruction of Ukraine As reported byNew American, Soros has a giant footprint in Ukraine Similar to his operations in dozens of other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens ofmillions of dollarsinto Ukrainian non governmental organizations (NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into a more open and democratic society ù We have good reason to take George Soros seriously Soros article downplays Putin s strategic prowess before going on to anticipate regime change in Russia in 2017 as a result of bankruptcy forced upon it by Western sanctions and crushed oil prices He then appears to credit Putin with masterminding a collapse ù in Europe and of anticipating benefits for Russia in the aftermath He notes, As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy it ù find yourself asking here: Why then did she create that crisis? ù that is because you are not a psychopath Soros article begins its descent with metaphysical and social observations, which from someone without billions of dollars behind them would be seen as merely subjective musings, before landing squarely on the runway of identifying Putin s Russia as the real threat This is not simplychutzpah The traits Soros exhibits are those of textbook psychopathy: blaming others for his own actions and attacking the victim is what the psychopath does Here, Soros disregards entirely his own extensive role in creating the problem he purports to seek to solve; meanwhile, he accuses Russia, the only country to man up to the war on Syria, of being behind the migration ù Soros has spent millions engineering Soros is part of a cabal which plans the overthrow of countries at dinner Psychopathy is the baseline requirement for membership So think conscience will make him and his friends stop at some point before you and your family reach conditions materially identical to those experienced by the inhabitants of the Donbass region or think that Western Europe is beyond the scope of their plans for engineered collapse just because you wouldn t do something like that you will find that you are wrong When Europe is in tatters, and its men (whom Soros money helped turn in one lifetime from actual men into effeminized liberal cultural lemmings) are squawking in disbelief as their pampered delusions are shattered in the collapse ù Soros envisages, Soros will not care No matter that this is Europe and it is your life under attack this time, and not that of brown people or Eastern Europeans It won t make any difference For a psychopath it s simple: you let him do it it s your fault The statements,

A: All go to a luxury Swiss resort very yearpic twitter com/0cm9PJSFOj It s worth reflecting on how well the world was doing before Professor Klaus Schwab had his bright idea for a European Management Forum The 1960s was an era of great economic, social and cultural advances for ordinary people across the globe These advances continued into the 1970s The world had never before been so democratic and never before had its wealth been so evenly shared But starting with the coup which toppled the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and saw him replaced with the capital friendly dictator and human rights oppressor Augusto Pinochet, the global economic order was restructured in the interests of a tiny but very greedy elite who were unhappy that their share of the cake had shrunk in the genuinely progressive period following World War Two A hallmark of this neoliberal era has been the way states have been captured to serve the interests of international finance capital and giant global corporations Publicly owned assets have been privatized, providing rich pickings for the banks and financial institutions who handle the sales Meanwhile, the very rich have enjoyed generous tax cuts if they even pay tax at all Meanwhile, austerity is imposed on the majority Davos has played a key role in this process If the World Economic Forum has a habit of coming up with big business friendly solutions it s no surprise, as itsmembers comprise 1,000 of the world s top corporations, global enterprises usually with more than US$5 billion in turnover Last week, as the well heeled attendees arrived in Davos in their private jets, Oxfamreleasedits latest report on global inequality The report revealed that the richest 1% now own more than the rest of the people in the world combined A more shocking indictment of forty odd years of neoliberalism would be hard to find It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super rich so few, you could fit them all on a single coach, says Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB s chief executive He might also have said we could fit the small group of the global super rich in one hotel in Davos, which is where most of them probably were last week We won t get any meaningful change arising from anything proposed at Davos because the iniquitous status quo is in the interest of those who fund the World Economic Forum To solve the problems of today we need to do away with elite gatherings attended by everyone who matters and re democratize our politics and our economies In short, we need to take power away from the billionaires who meet each year at Davos, and return it to the people Follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/330046-davos-problem-global-economy-elite/

everybody It is no longer acceptable to be yourself This agenda serves the 1 percent and Washington, Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist, told RT in an interview Billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has attracted attention once again, this time saying the European Union should take at least a million refugees every year to ease the mass exodus of desperate people from the Middle East and Africa Soros wants the EU to dig deep and pay an annual amount of at least 5,000 per refugee, or 20 billion And this coming at a time of severe austerity measures pushed onto the European people, not to mention the bailout of entire countries, like Greece The Lonely Chancellor: Merkel Under Fire as Refugee Crisis Worsenshttps:// tdotco /ZqV8ScWwzQ Thus, it s little wonder that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says philanthropists like Soros must assume part of the blame for the current crisis This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state, Orban told reporters This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros Soros responded by issuing anemailstatement to Bloomberg Business, †claiming his international organization works to uphold European values ù,while Mr Orban s efforts to fortify the Hungarian border thereby halting a massive wave of illegal migrants undermine those values ù His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle, ùSoros added Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle ù READ MORE: Hungarian PM blames Soros for fueling refugee crisis in Europe Paul Craig Roberts offers his own interpretation as to what has precipitated this crisis of epic proportions as millions of foreigners now descend en masse on European communities, many of which are totally unprepared for the influx of foreigners It is Washington s wars, ùnot George Soros per se, that are forcing the refugees to flee their homelands and seek to enter Europe, Roberts believes Since the Clinton regime, we ve had three two term American presidents who have been at war, ùhe said They have created millions of displaced people and they are now seeking refuge in Europe ù Merkel s stance on#RefugeesCrisis naive, irrational former Czech presidenthttp:// tdotco /8tMFCf8IHNpic twitter com/uvONW5UUIw Roberts also asks whether Soros advice regarding Europe absorbing millions of refugees is based on something other than just humanitarian considerations We have to first ask the question whether Soros progressive causes are real or merely a cover for rule by the 1 percent, ùRoberts said You see, when political boundaries are broken down the result is a power vacuum to which Washington and the 1 percent can move in their pawns ù One consequence of Washington s wars over the course of three presidencies has been to destroy stable countries and leave in their place disorganized, small fiefdoms that war on one another, ùRoberts said What Soros means is: European values means you lost your national identity and you become a hodgepodge of different cultures and different nationalities and your traditional historical existence is dissolved in this pot of diverse peoples ù Migrants & refugees sue Berlin s main refugee center for delays to welfare handoutshttp:// tdotco /uXEPqpEfJOpic twitter com/fbri4tcGHq Roberts applauds Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orban], saying he is exactly correct that this is a threat to the existence of European peoples because they become dissolved in a so called diverse society of different people, different religions, different cultures, different values ù But for those individuals like George Soros who comprise the 1 percent of the global elite, their goal is to redefine what it means to be a European George Soros is in effect saying: We are redefining Europe Europe no longer consists of Hungarians, British, French, Germans and Greeks, etc It now consists of everybody And all of you historical people to be European means you have to be part of everybody You can no longer be yourselves That s the message ù Refugee rhetoric reminiscent of pre Holocaust sentiment UN human rights chiefhttp:// tdotco /BWeB1Qaiohpic twitter com/Bdi98Gp4Zw Yet there is little resistance to the agenda because Europeans have heard the same message repeated so many times they have been brainwashed, ùwhich then makes it easy for their so called leaders to open the borders and accept all of these refugees that Washington s wars have created ù Roberts also makes a dramatic claim, saying that every country that joined the European Union has committed an act of national suicide ù It seems to me that of all the leaders of Eastern and Western Europe, the Hungarian prime minister is the only one that has any sense He says: We re not going to commit suicide If Germany wants to commit suicide, fine If they want to follow Merkel into suicide, let them But not us ù Hungary s PM accuses George Soros of undermining European nations on refugeeshttps:// tdotco

the scenes destabilizing the country so as to prop up a Western friendly puppet leadership Indeed, Western non government organization have been operating freely in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union According to Roberts, it should come as no surprise as to where the funding for such large scale, operations originates And all of these non governmental organizations, they are funded by private donors, such as Soros, they are funded by the Department of State, the National Endowment for Democracy and they all serve as agents of Washington foreign policy And this is the way that very wealthy individuals like Soros come together with the government ù But this is not just an act of aggression against the Ukrainian people, but an attack on Russia itself, ùRoberts says This is an effort to weaken Russia, to threaten Russia, to make Russia back off from its resistance to American hegemony over the world, ùRoberts proclaims These behind the scenes operations, which work under the cover of lofty sounding agencies, benefit the United States by making it impossible for a European government to exist independently and therefore Washington does not have to worry about European governments such as Germany realizing that their own national interests are contrary to American national interests ù Ultimately, the work of these philanthropists and non governmental organizations is designed to break apart European national identity in order to prevent any sort of loss of the American empire to independent foreign policies among European countries, ùRoberts says don t have a

"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta s desperate quest for legitimacy Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military final solution for the east In 2001, the Austrian
 economist Hans Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled Democracy:
 The God that Failed , in which he among other things 
 compared the process of voting to a religious ritual Just as the
 ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
 ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
 kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity In his
 study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
 monarchies actually safeguarded peoples lives and liberty far
 more than democracy has before making a case for outright
 anarchy Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
 democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
 home Western leaders routinely speak of democracy as a
 virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as rooted in the sanctity of the individual ù(BH Obama in
 Talinn, September 2014) In actuality, democracy is simply a
 decision making process in which the majority gets its way The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they liberate , however, democracy means whatever the
 liberators say it means Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
 independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not democratic 
 because the High Priesthood in the West says so while the
 violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was midwifed ùby Washington (per V Nuland s famous phone
 call) Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
 junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
 against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem Its prime
 minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
 Americans ( Yats is our guy, ùto quote Nuland again) 
 Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
 presidential vote in May By the time it was held, Donetsk and
 Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
 their separation Even so, the junta s Western backers proclaimed
 Petro Poroshenko elected on May 25 as the legitimate leader
 of Ukraine Quite unlike the aggressor and invader ù it was
 accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
 Poroshenko launched an all out war against the two eastern
 regions That war was lost Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
 lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
 battalions such as Azov have terrorized any civilians
 they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
 have failed Hence all the crying about Russian
 invasion to the Western press, but also the coming general
 election That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
 sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
 they are democratic , and thus worth backing More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
 nine months, this weekend s vote will showcase the absurdity of democracy as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic 
 What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
 procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
 up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
 acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
 between the Nationalist Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
 boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko And with
 every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis 
 not the neo variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind 
 that triangle keeps getting smaller Recent polls by the Western funded Democratic Initiatives
 Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post suggest a significant
 lead for President Poroshenko s party, followed by Lyashko s
 Radicals and Yatsenyuk s People s Front Meanwhile, the
 formerly ruling Party of Regions and the Communists 
 intimidated, brutalized and all but banned are polling in
 single digits However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
 they were undecided ù, which suggests they are either
 afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven t yet decided on the
 lesser of evils Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
 under Kiev s control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
 their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
 Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open
 for business But the liberators themselves won t get
 to vote; for whatever reason, the junta s legislature failed to
 pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front Meanwhile, the civilsociety organizations funded for
 years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy
 lists OPORA as one of its aid recipients in 2009) to create
 fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
 violations of campaign rules Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
 already reported over 527 violations, including at least 80
 cases of alleged voter bribery ùThey either haven t got the
 memo about how this election should be a showcase of democratic 
 Ukraine versus the authoritarian Russia, or they did
 get the memo, and are significantly under reporting voter
 intimidation and manipulation For their part, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics are refusing to
 go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
 November 7 They may not have a chance to hold them There isn t
 much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
 artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by A
 renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
 idea, but the junta s generals have certainly demonstrated
 greater stupidity over the course of the campaign When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several
 Serb majority areas refused to accept Zagreb s rule The Croatian
 government, backed by Germany, initially failed to conquer these
 areas, and accepted a UN guaranteed armistice (Vance Plan) Four
 years later, backed by the US, Zagreb launched an all out assault
 and reintegrated the territories by force, expelling
 some 200,000 Serbs that lived there Poroshenko s adviser Yury
 Lutsenko openly stated back in September that Kiev ought to
 follow Croatia s example in regard to the Donbass The democratic West said nothing After all, what
 Croatia did was a democracy too Because in the eyes of Western
 governments, the word means whatever they say it means, nothing

 You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
 blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
 brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
 greed, graft, and mediocre leaders The fact is ISIS, the Arab
 Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
 Washington policy under Obama This cannot be repudiated, but it
 can be reasoned In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr Ahmed Bensaada
 assembles a body of evidence that the so called Arab Spring was a
 destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
 the US State Department and historically CIA funded foundations
 for so called freedom No, you c1985annot use the he s one
 of them ùexcuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
 Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
 Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
 Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
 Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
 reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
 Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
 Development (USAID) î and George Soros opensociety Institute
 (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
 that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary The hierarchy
 and system behind him might be the anti Christ As proof the system ùof thought in the west it corrupted, let s look
 at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
 industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime s Senatorial
 superhero While some of us would like to classify his brand of
 Neo conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
 presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
 witness to systematic abuses Case in point, McCain is head of an
 organization known as the International Republican Institute
 (IRI) That institution s stated goal is to; advance
 democracy worldwide ù but the how, ùthe spread,
 and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us The
 good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
 analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
 Department Recently IRI worked with the U S Middle East Partnership
 Initiative (MEPI) The point here is, in many instances where
 Arab Spring or seeming anti Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
 organizations like McCain s IRI are somehow present This quote
 from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute s
 (IRI) Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership ù project 
 This project supports independent democratic political activists
 and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
 dialogue IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
 Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
 research to key partners, stakeholders, civilsociety 
 representatives and influential decision makers ù But still further inside American geo strategizing, the
 aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
 utter decay of thinking Thisreportentitled, On Strategic
 Non Violent Change, ùby one of the world s leading
 insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
 blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
 corporations Helvey s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
 into insurrectionists are well known But his recent coming out
 over Ukraine s recent coup d √©tat, ùthis is lesser
 known Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
 wrong is with us While most of us know we love peace, the rest
 of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
 killers It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
 guide for a kind of governing This guide has been in practice in
 Washington for some decades now Much has been written about
 Machiavelli s The Prince, ùbut this quote reveals the
 essence of Machiavellian intent: The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
 world consists chiefly of the vulgar ù Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
 belief Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
 Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
 by untimely anti Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
 from the west Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
 Peace and Prosperity calls the West s subversion of the Ukraine
 peace process by NATO a grand deception ùBut beyond
 just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
 of editorials for peace There simply is no anti war ùsentiment, not in the press To sum up here, you don t have to have a PhD in political science
 to understand Machiavellian intentions The Italian philosopher
 outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
 congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a prince ùor dictator Power, as such, was outlined as
 ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise 
 The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
 mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
 makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
 us today Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
 of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize The continual
 stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
 Machiavelli s principles, as do Obama s grand schemes for health
 care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare In a
 nutshell, Obama s advisers are political scientists of the first
 order To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey s Einstein Institute piece
 again; A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
 obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
 public ù Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
 huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli London, Berlin and
 Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
 reason But in studying Niccol√≤ di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
 you ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
 practice the kingly game What s important for us all is the
 purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism Has America
 acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
 intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
 leave to you As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
 Shelley s modern Prometheus is upon us We have this passage from
 Frankenstein: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
 make peace with all I have love in me the likes of which you can
 scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not
 believe If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the

"5 Jun, 2014","‚ÄãTiananmen Square June 4, 1989: What really happened?","This week marks twenty five years since the world was told of a brutal massacre by the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army of thousands ù of peacefully protesting pro democracy students in Beijing s Tiananmen Square William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com The response from the West then was to demonize the Chinese
 government and to impose economic and military sanctions which in
 many cases exist to the present day A recent release of a
 diplomatic telegram from then US Ambassador to China, James E 
 Lilley, to Washington sheds new light on what really happened
 that June 4 According to the mainstream Western version of events, thousands
 of Chinese university students began their sit in protest
 demanding democracy and transparency from the Communist
 government in April and into May 1989 in the huge Tiananmen
 Square, directly across from the historic Forbidden City edifice
 in central Beijing They defiantly faced off against the Chinese
 Communist Party (CCP) and the People s Liberation Army On May
 20, 1989, the CCP imposed martial law and ordered truckloads of
 soldiers to Beijing to take back the square from protesters The
 Westernaccounthas it that then, on June 3 into June
 4, PLA soldiers opened fire and killed up to 1000 student
 protesters ù WikiLeaks, the website that received hundreds of thousands of
 pages of intercepted diplomatic correspondence from the US State
 Department, has released a classified diplomatic cable from
 then Beijing Ambassador James Lilley to Washington dated July 12,
 1989 more than four weeks after the events In his report, Lilley
 writes the following shocking version of events: OF JUNE 3 4 EVENTS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE 1 CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT 2 SUMMARY DURING A RECENT MEETING, A LATIN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT
 AND HIS WIFE PROVIDED POLOFF AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON
 JUNE 3 4 AND THEIR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN
 SQUARE ALTHOUGH THEIR ACCOUNT GENERALLY FOLLOWS THOSE PREVIOUSLY
 REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND
 CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE SQUARE THEY WERE ABLE TO ENTER
 AND LEAVE THE SQUARE SEVERAL TIMES AND WERE NOT HARASSED BY
 TROOPS REMAINING WITH STUDENTS BY THE MONUMENT TO THE PEOPLE S
 HEROES UNTIL THE FINAL WITHDRAWAL, THE DIPLOMAT SAID THERE WERE
 NO MASS SHOOTINGS OF STUDENTS IN THE SQUARE OR AT THE MONUMENT 
 END SUMMARY (Emphasis mine WE) Lilley in his memo goes on to name the Latin American couple as
 Chilean Second Secretary Carlos Gallo and his wife They had been
 dining near the square and went to observe events As foreign
 diplomats, they managed to move in the crowd without difficulty 
 They said the PLA had evidently been ordered not to interfere
 with foreigners They reported hearing shots and wounded students
 were brought to a Red Cross tent for care Then the US Ambassador
 reported, 8 GALLO EVENTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE RED CROSS STATION, AGAIN
 HOPING THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT FIRE ON THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE 
 HE WATCHED THE MILITARY ENTER THE SQUARE AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY
 MASS FIRING OF WEAPONS INTO THE CROWDS, ALTHOUGH SPORADIC GUNFIRE
 WAS HEARD HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE TROOPS WHICH ENTERED THE
 SQUARE WERE ACTUALLY ARMED ONLY WITH ANTI RIOT GEAR TRUNCHEONS
 AND WOODEN CLUBS (Emphasis added WE) Then Gallo reports in a subsequent meeting with the US Embassy s
 political officer a most remarkable development which was
 entirely blocked out of sensational Western media The student
 leaders and the PLA reached an agreement that the protestors
 would be allowed to leave peacefully if they disbanded their
 sit in: 10 ALTHOUGH GUNFIRE COULD BE HEARD, GALLO SAID THAT APART FROM
 SOME BEATING OF STUDENTS, THERE WAS NO MASS FIRING INTO THE CROWD
 OF STUDENTS AT THE MONUMENT WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED SOME
 REPORTEDLY EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF MASSACRES AT THE MONUMENT WITH
 AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, GALLO SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH SLAUGHTER 
 ONCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE STUDENTS TO WITHDRAW, LINKING
 HANDS TO FORM A COLUMN, THE STUDENTS LEFT THE SQUARE THROUGH THE
 SOUTHEAST CORNER ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE, INCLUDING GALLO, LEFT 
 THE FEW THAT ATTEMPTED TO REMAIN BEHIND WERE BEATEN AND DRIVEN TO
 JOIN THE END OF THE DEPARTING PROCESSION ONCE OUTSIDE THE
 SQUARE, THE STUDENTS HEADED WEST ON QIANMEN DAJIE WHILE GALLO
 HEADED EAST TO HIS CAR (Emphasismine WE) The report of a deal between student protestors and the military
 to end the protest peacefully and leave had been told to me by
 various young Chinese in personal accounts on recent visits to
 Beijing, but until this WikiLeaks release of the Lilley cable, it
 could never be confirmed Now it seems clear that the entire
 story of thousands ù of dead students at Tiananmen Square, whose
 very name in the West is synonymous with brutal government
 suppression of democracy, was largely a fabrication The protests
 were real, but not the horrendous stories of slaughter Indeed, as I have written elsewhere, there is rather strong
 circumstantial evidence that suggests that the CIA and US State
 Department played a key role in trying to goad on the student
 protestors at Tiananmen Square; much like the CIA did in Hungary
 in 1956, in order to provoke a government bloodbath of
 repression Around the same time as Tiananmen protests in
 April June 1989, the Chinese government banned a Chinese NGO of
 US operator George Soros, the Fund for the Reform and Opening of
 China, after interrogating its Chinese director in August 1989
 and claiming that the Soros China fund had links to the CIA The
 Soros Fund according to Chinese reports had been supported by
 ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang Significantly in addition to the Soros Fund, Gene Sharp of the
 Cambridge Massachusetts Albert Einstein Institution, whose
 handbooks on non violence as a method of warfare ù have been the
 how to ù textbook for every colorrevolution to date, was in
 Beijing days before the Tiananmenevents Then US Ambassador Lilley himself was
 a career CIA officer who, like then President George H W Bush,
 had been in the secretive Yale Skull & Bones society, and who
 was with Bush at the CIA The circumstantial evidence points to
 an attempted US destabilization of China designed to coincide
 with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, with Lilley the
 likely on the ground coordinator When the PLA failed to fill Beijing with the blood of thousands ù
 of student democracy martyrs, Washington could simply go with
 fabrication of a fantasy or virtual massacre and, because of its
 overwhelming control of mainstream media; most of the world could
 believe the Washington version The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/163872-china-tiananmen-square-june4/
"3 Apr, 2014",Billionaire George Soros behind major push for marijuana legalization,"Hungarian American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros is no stranger when it comes to throwing around money, but the former hedge fund manager is making headlines over some major donations he s made to help legalize marijuana On the heels of the approval of two of the United States first
 recreational laws in Colorado and Washington, other locales
 across the country are considering implementing policy changes
 that could decriminalize pot, ease penalties for users or
 eliminate weed laws altogether Advocacy groups are leading the
 campaign to crush marijuana prohibition from coast to coast, and
 83 year old Soros is helping line the pockets of those making
 that push On Wednesday this week, Kelly Riddell atThe Washington Timespulled back the curtain
 to reveal details about some of the roles that Soros has played
 in the pro weed debate, and helped explain how the billionaire s
 many foundations are fighting the war against pot prohibition Through a network of nonprofit groups, Mr Soros has spent
 at least $80 million on the legalization effort since 1994, when
 he diverted a portion of his foundation s funds to organizations
 exploring alternative drug policies, according to tax
 filings, ùRiddell wrote The Soros affiliated Foundation to Promote an Open
 Societydonates roughly $4 million annually to the Drug Policy Alliance,
 Riddell added, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the
 nation s leading organization promoting drug policies that are
 grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights Soros
 is among the group of board members who help steer policy reform
 efforts undertaken by that organization, which has contributed to
 the successful attempts in both Colorado and Washington state to
 legalize recreational marijuana, as well as in Uruguay where last
 year the South American country became the first in the world to
 allow for the regulation, distribution and sale of weed to legal
 adults Records obtained by the Times also reveal that Soros cuts other
 substantial checks annually to the American Civil Liberties
 Union, which in turn funds marijuana legalization
 efforts, ù Riddell wrote, as well as the Marijuana Policy
 Project which funds state ballot measures In 2013, the MPP
 ranked Soros as the ninth most influential marijuana user in the
 US, behind President Barack Obama, television host Oprah Winfrey
 and a handful of other politicians and celebrities The co director and spokesperson for that group, Mason Tvert,
 told the Times that MPP and the Drug Policy Alliance are planning
 to support full legalization measures in the near future in the
 states of Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine, Montana and
 Nevada, and Soros himself has advocated on behalf of previous
 attempts to abolish pot prohibition in at least one of those
 locales Ahead of an attempt in November 2010 to legalize weed in
 California through the failed Proposition 19, Soros wrote an
 op ed for theWall Street Journalin which he called the
 since failed initiative a major step forward ù In many respects, of course, Proposition 19 already is a
 winner no matter what happens on Election Day, ù Soros wrote
 then The mere fact of its being on the ballot has elevated
 and legitimized public discourse about marijuana and marijuana
 policy in ways I could not have imagined a year ago ù Soros declined to be interviewed for the Times article published
 this week, but he s more than likely enthused about the approval
 of pro weed laws in Colorado and Washington carried out after
 Prop 19 was defeated in the polls And with regards to
 initiatives up for vote during the 2014 election, Riddell wrote
 that Soros is once again playing a substantial role In Florida, Mr Soros has teamed up with multimillionaire
 and Democratic fundraiser John Morgan to donate more than 80
 percent of the money to get medical marijuana legalization on the
 ballot through its initiative United for Care, People United for
 Medical Marijuana, ù Riddell wrote, and the MPP is
 focusing a lot of time and resources passing bills ù in
 Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and
 Vermont, according to her report It s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized
 under federal law, ù Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the
 Marijuana Majority advocacy group, told the Times We now
 have 20 states plus the District of Columbia considering
 legalization efforts, two states have already legalized it for
 all adults over the age of 21 î politicians will have to follow
 the will of the people on this ù AsRT reportedpreviously, the results of a Pew
 Research Center poll released last year found that 52 percent of
 Americans support the legalization of marijuana Despite recently
 approved laws in Washington and Colorado, marijuana remains an
 illegal narcotic under federal law ",https://www.rt.com/usa/soros-mpp-times-marijuana-189/

 democracy in Ukraine, many of the same NGOs that helped create
 the current instability in Kiev This is the last thing Ukraine
 needs at the moment, says Engdahl RT:Washington is offering Ukraine a one
 billion dollar loan Is it a good deal for Ukraine? William Engdahl:If you look at the details of
 what they re offering, they re not offering a loan of even one
 billion dollars They are offering a loan guarantee and the cost
 of that loan guarantee is that Ukraine submits to IMF austerity
 like Greece did, and that will simply open up their economy to
 the final rape and plunder from the West But the other point about this is that the debt of Ukraine that
 comes due this year is a staggering amount I believe it is some
 25 billion dollars that has to be rolled over And a one billion
 dollar loan guarantee it s hard to know who is more stupid in
 this piece of legislation: the United States congressmen, who
 voted for this, or the non elected government of Ukraine, if they
 accept this because it is simply a no brainer on all sides RT:Also the bill gives more power to
 America s co called democracy promoting ù NGOs Are these the
 same NGOs that reportedly helped topple the democratically
 elected government there in Ukraine a few weeks ago? WE:Of course, they are They are the National
 Endowment for Democracy (NED), Freedom House, no doubt, the Open
 Society Foundations of George Soros, who always seems to be
 paired up with these organizations John McCain is the chairman
 of the NED s International Republican Institute He has been on
 the front row of every regime stabilization in recent years So
 these are not democracy promoting NGOs, these are coup d √©tat
 NGOs, who are doing what the CIA used to do, only through private
 agencies that are backed up by the US government This is not anything good for Ukraine Ukraine doesn t need this
 nonsense It s interference in the domestic affairs of a
 sovereign country But since when has Washington or at least the
 Congress been concerned about that? RT:So, if they are not going to promote
 democracy, how exactly are their NGOs going to influence
 political life in Ukraine? WE:Well, as you pointed out, the NGOs prepared
 the way for the last several years, well before the decision not
 to join the EU confederation agreement taken by Viktor
 Yanukovich s government last November They had been preparing to
 oust the Moscow leaning Yanukovich, a fairly elected presidentof
 Ukraine, and create the incident using canvas operatives from
 Belgrade financed by US taxpayers money, to train activists
 assembled in Maidan Square and create the movement that shapes
 exactly what the government will or will not be able to do And to do more of that for Ukraine I think Ukraine needs a
 little break from all of this ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-ukraine-loan-ngo-945/

 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel
 religions The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-intellectuals-standing-ground-833/
"11 Oct, 2013",American truckers are putting Washington DC on notice,"There seems to be no end to the political theater in Washington DC But what began as a simple game of chicken between the White House and the Republican opposition has quickly morphed into a game of political Russian roulette Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK A nation polarized, stuck in the ultimate political gridlock
 imaginable over federal spending As America waits for a
 resolution to the federal government shutdown, an unlikely
 community has decided to put their money where their mouth is By
 all accounts, they are the most under appreciated industry in
 today s America Truck drivers are the backbone of the American
 economy Everything Americans own, buy and need is delivered to
 them by trucks daily, yet few take any notice of the people
 behind the wheels That could all change after this weekend, as
 America gets a taste of its first ever diesel driven flash mob According the organizers at RideForTheConstitution org, over
 3,000 truckers, thousands more demonstrators on foot, have
 already RSVP d to converge on the nation s capital starting this
 Friday, Oct 11th, as they plan to slow traffic into Washington
 DC, and present a list of demands to law makers there Somebody had to do it, ùexplained Zeeda Andrews, a former
 country singer and Mac Truck spokesmodel Organizers have been
 surprised by the amount of support they ve gathered since their
 campaign gained visibility last month I didn t think it would be this big Maybe that s because the
 American people are just fed up It s more than just a trucking
 issue now, we are in a constitutional crisis and something has to
 be done, and it s common people like myself with nothing to
 lose, who are going to get something done ù Considering the fact that most people have never sat in the cab
 of an 18 wheeler in their life, the DC truckers have somehow
 managed to attract a pretty wide appeal Already, parallel
 protests have sprung up, set to take place in most major US
 cities on Friday and Saturday Larry Klayman, a former US Justice Department prosecutor, and
 founder of Freedom Watch, has also volunteered his support for
 the DC truckers campaign This past summer Klayman represented
 the families of Navy SEAL Team 6 who were killed when their
 Chinook helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan in August 2011,
 following the White House s rather incredible raid on the alleged
 bin Laden lair in Abbotabad, Pakistan I m throwing my support behind this campaign because we ve
 have had enough Our government has broken away from the people,
 and our grievances are not being heard, so we need to get out
 there and make it clear to the powers that be that be whether
 it s President Obama, Speaker of the House John Boehner, or
 whether it s majority leader Harry Reid in the Senate that we
 are simply not going to take it anymore The time has come to
 save our country, and we ll do it in the style of Ghandi, Lech
 Walesa, and Martin Luther King ù, said Klayman Organisers will join Klayman today at the steps of the US Capitol
 building to present their list of demands At the top of that
 list is an appeal for economic survival, with a call for
 immediate action on the spiralling cost of diesel and harassment
 from federal regulatory agencies which is not only driving up
 costs of goods and services, but also killing transportation
 profits, pushing independent truckers into fuel poverty, and
 ultimately out of business Beyond this emerges a broader spectrum movement of political
 dissent, which echoes concerns heard from many different quarters
 in the US As far as civil disobedience goes, their protest is no walk in
 the park Logistically speaking, it s a nightmare Then there s
 the political demands, which, in terms of the average Americans 
 attention deficit disorder, are comprehensive, and not exactly
 media friendly especially for the likes of MSNBC and FOX But
 unlike the much celebrated, but highly ineffective Occupy
 Movement, which ended up being a controlled street party whose
 indelible mark on society was that it produced a boiled down
 abstract of class warfare The 1% vs the 99% the DC
 Truckers have a fairly sharp libertarian agenda, coupled with a
 detailed list of constitutional demands Unless you ve been hiding in a bunker lately, you would know that
 something is serious brewing in America In the last year alone,
 the White House has been dodging and fighting to stave off a
 seemingly endless daisy chain of scandals In addition to the
 Navy SEAL Team 6 cover up, there is a not so small issue of the
 White House using the IRS to target the President s political
 opponents, the horrific Benghazi cover up involving a dead US
 Ambassador and servicemen, and gun running from Libya to Syria,
 and the US support of al Qaeda fighters in Syria In addition to these and other federal interventions hurting
 truckers livelihoods, the campaign feels that all
 unconstitutional federal laws and agencies should be wiped from
 the books They include the National Defense Authorization Act
 (NDAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transport
 Security Agency (TSA), and The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) US talk radio host Pete Santilli has volunteered to help the
 truckers get their message out over the airwaves look at the list of demands, regardless of where you
 are in the political spectrum, you would not disagree with: stop
 supporting al Qaeda (in Syria), don t raise the debt ceiling 
 and threaten us that if we don t print another trillion dollars
 that they ll collapse out system that s a forceful means to
 steal money from us President Obama needs to be held accountable
 for crimes committed against the United States and Congress needs
 to hear those crimes ù The beauty of this event is that it is open and nonpartisan 
 it absolutely cuts right through party lines Every American can
 participate in this ù Santilli adds here, John McCain and
 Lindsey Graham they must go Any of these unconstitutional
 legislators, anyone who has committed unconstitutional acts in
 office, must vacate voluntarily If they refuse to go, we want to
 cut off their money supply so they won t be able to make millions
 off us anymore ù The Truckers are not without their enemies, who are keen to
 discredit them, silence them, or both As their campaign goes viral, so goes the media shooting match 
 The campaign has been directly targeted by George Soros funded
 leftwing outlet, Media Matters, who have been busy digging up old
 Facebook posts and likes from personal pages of Ride For
 The Constitution s organisers, in effect, waging a character
 assassination against them When running a 21st century activist campaign, one must also
 beware of deadly communitarian policing, also known as community guidelines ùpolicy Ride For The Constitution s Facebook page was live only six days
 when it received 86,000 likes, only to be promptly pulled down by
 the social network The same happened with its Twitter account,
 which was pulled down after only 6 days In both cases, accounts were frozen because of an anonymous
 complaint Santilli says he s mounting a legal challenge against one of the
 social networks It seems like the First Amendment doesn t apply on social
 networks You work hard to build up a huge audience, only to see
 it disappear in an instant because a few political enemies
 anonymously complain that they were somehow offended ù As with all political movements through history, the pain
 normally starts in the wallet Rising toll road charges and
 inflated diesel prices are forcing many out of America s trucking
 industry In 2013, the reality is that drivers are losing their
 trucks and losing their business After labour, diesel fuel is
 the second highest expense for motor carriers, and can reach as
 much as much as 20% of transport s total operating costs Organisers Zeeda Andrews and Michael JB Schaffner
 concluded in their joint statement on what they feel is a
 national crisis: By no means are these the only issues that need action, to be
 resolved There are many, many more issues that continue to
 plague this industry, as new regulations create even more
 contradictions in law As per the fourteenth amendment of our
 Constitution, No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
 abridge the privileges, or immunities of Citizens of the United
 States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty,
 or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
 within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ù ""So let these issues be the beginning of where we take a
 stand, not just as The American Drivers, but as Free and
 Independent Americans, protecting what our Constitution preserves
 for us ù At the very least Washington DC might be in for a shock this
 weekend Call it shock therapy for the political class At its
 best, it could jump start real American discourse nationwide Let the ride begin The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-economy-government-shutdown-truck-992/

cache Their selected scandals so far has hit French President Hollande,

dealers, oligarchs, financial fraudsters and hundreds of Germans ù
For owning an offshore account?The ICIJ groupclaims, The hoard of documents represents
the biggest stockpile of inside information about the offshore
system ever obtained by a media organization more than 160 times
larger than the leak of U S State Department documents by
Wikileaks in 2010 ùFor anyone with knowledge of how tightly controlled mainstream
global media is, the names of the newspapers the ICIJ chose to
analyze the documents include BBC and The Guardian in the U K , The
Washington Post, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Le
Monde in France, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung in Germany, The Washington
Post, among others UK Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to
use his leadership of the G8 to help crack down on tax evasion and
money laundering While the mainstream world press is focusing on the leaks, it s
relevant to ask just who is this ICIJ leaker?According to their website, the ICIJ was founded in 1997 as a
project of the Center for Public Integrity to extend the
Center s style of watchdog journalism ù Among financial donors
to ICIJ are opensociety Foundations, which have been involved in
many countries targeted by the US State Department for regime
change or colorrevolution s ù including Georgia, Ukraine, Burma
(Myanmar), Libya The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of
Hewlett Packard founder and former Assistant Defense Secretary
David Packard, among others But the more interesting organization is the one which created
ICIJ: the Center for Public Integrity, which shares the same office
floor with ICIJ Here we find a creation of the most powerful
families of Wall Street and US political establishment The Center
for Public Integrity was created in 1989 to enhance
democracyby revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal
of trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the
tools of investigative journalism ù † Sounds noble
enough Notably, however, listed funders in 2012 of the Center include the
Ford Foundation, documented in the Cold War to work intimately with
the CIA; George Soros opensociety Foundations; John D &
Catherine T MacArthur Foundation; billionaire Wall Street banker
Sandy Bernstein s Sanford C Bernstein & Co , LLC; GE
Foundation; Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller Family
Fund Now what do America s cr√®me de la cr√®me of powerful families and
bankers find so compelling about financing an organization of
journalists who now hold documents allegedly containing material
that could be used to blackmail governments and politicians and
businessmen around the globe? Are their offshore holdings to be
exposed along with those of Russians or French or Germans?The relevant question is what agency would have the capacity to
hack international computer data banks and secret encrypted banking
offshore records to give to ICIJ? The methodology of the ICIJ suggests another agenda at play A
global witch hunt against private fortunes îlegal or illegal îhas
begun No longer is it a former employee of UBS or another Swiss
bank who steals data files of a few secret German clients to give
German tax authorities as an act of conscience ù Now all offshore
accounts in the world can presumably be exposed as ICIJ
decides James S Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey & Company,estimatesthat wealthy individuals have $21
trillion to $32 trillion in private financial wealth tucked away in
offshore havens The question is what agency or agencies of which governments have
the espionage facilities to pull off such a massive global hacking
of all offshore bank accounts?William A Hamilton was involved in the Reagan years with a project
that the National Security Agency initiated to interdict the sale
of embargoed technology to the Soviet Union In a recent exchange
with the author regarding the source ù for the ICIJ files on global
offshore accounts, Hamilton noted, NSA is one and perhaps the only
obvious candidate ù He added that in the 1980s the NSA obtained
a copy of [Hamilton s software] PROMIS from the US Department of
Justice and arranged for copies to be installed on computers in the
banking sector (wire transfer clearing houses the World Bank major
commercial and investment banks worldwide) to facilitate NSA s
real time electronic surveillance ù † Clearly in the
intervening three decades the NSA international banking covert
espionage capabilities must have been upgraded There is a role for genuine honest investigative journalism, but
the Secrecy for Sale project of the ICIJ smells like a massive US

"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their
associated think tanks in being effective representatives of their
constituencies ùIRI is chaired by conservative Senator John
McCain, known for his extremely aggressive position in favor of
Israel and US conflicts overseas, while other leading figures have
held senior foreign policy positions in the Reagan and Bush
administrations IRI works in countries important to U S 
interests, where we can make a difference IRI focuses on three
tasks: helping political parties broaden their appeal, ensuring
that they rule justly once elected and aiding civilsociety in
guaranteeing good governance IRI can help catalyze the efforts of
democratic activists in a country so long as they want change
more than we want it for them, ùwrites IRI s president, Lorne
Craner, who previously held a position in the US State
Department The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also
receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the opensociety 
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
