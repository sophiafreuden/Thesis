"10 Nov, 2019",On Contact: Resistance & the left with Paul Street,"Journalist Chris Hedges talks to author and political commentator Paul Street about the failure of the American left, new forms of resistance, democracy, and the deep roots of America s ruling oligarchy Please note:  This interview was taped in June 2018 YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud com/rttv/sets/on contact Chris Hedges: Welcome to On Contact   Today, we discuss the collapse of the American Left and to quote Lenin, What must be done, with author Paul Street Paul Street: The Democratic Party at the end of the day, it s not it s not so much feckless or stupid   It s not that it doesn t know how to win   It s corrupt   It s owned by a small it s owned by a small cadre of campaign donors by the unelected dictatorship of money, which runs both parties in this country and it has a business model   They re full grown adults   They know what they re doing   They know what they re about   And they would rather lose to the right wing   Even a neo fascistic Christian eco apocalyptic right wing dedicated to burning every last possible fuel on this planet I guess which will bring us closer to the Christian Armageddon and we ll find out who s saved and who s the damned   They d rally they d rather give up the lose to that horrific hyper dangerous right wing Republican Party than lose even to a mildly progressive social Democratic Left within their own party CH: The Trump administration did not rise prima facie like Venus on a half shell from the sea   Donald Trump is the result of a long process, political, and cultural, and social decay   He s a product of our failed democracy   The longer we perpetuate the fiction that we live in a functioning democracy, the Trump and the political mutations around him are somehow an abhorrent deviation that can be vanquished in the next election, the more we will hurdle towards tyranny   The problem is not Trump   It is a political system dominated by corporate power and the mandarins of the two major political parties in which we don t count   We will wrest back political control by dismantling the corporate state, and this means massive and sustained civil disobedience like that demonstrated by teachers around the country this year   If we do not push back by building a militant and radical left, we will enter a new dark age, one that will end in ecocide and the extinction of the human species   With me to discuss the imperative of new forms of resistance is Paul Street   He is the author of numerous books including Radical Oppression in the Global Metropolis, The Empire s New Clothes, Barack Obama in the Real World of Power, and They Rule: The 1% vs Democracy   Paul   So let s talk about the failure of the left which you ve written I think quite presciently about   How would you describe the bankruptcy of the American Left? PS: Well, you know, there s the question of whether there really is a left in the United States of America right now   That phrase is thrown out thrown around with incredible looseness and I never know entirely what it means   In the official dominant media politics culture, it s it refers, I suppose, to the Democratic Party   And as I said at the Left Forum the other day, calling the Democratic Party the left is like calling the Pork Producers Association a vegan lobbying organization   You know, the Democratic Party has been openly subservient and subordinate to the corporate elite and it has been for decades   I ve been hearing all my life, and I really mean that, since the 1960s, so we re talking about for five decades, I ve been hearing about the Democratic Party needs to get its stuff together and really do progressive things and run progressive candidates   And then everything will be okay and get back to the business of winning politics CH: Right, but the left falls for it   Election cycle PS: Again CH: after election cycle after election cycle, the self identified left PS: Again and again and again, even some of our foremost left intellectuals predictably like clockwork   Once every four years, even though they know better, traipse out the standard lesser evilest lecture that if that if you if you don t vote for this party to block the worst party then it s going to be a disaster CH: Well, that s the whole Democratic Party strategy vis a vis Trump   They re not proposing anything substantial, they re just hoping that Trump being Trump will implode, which may not work   I m not convinced it s going to work PS: Oh, I think there s a distinct possibility now that Trump s going to get a that he can very possibly get a second term and that whether liberals and progressives and the so called left like to admit it or not, Trump is a very powerful force somehow   It s disgusting to all of us and we ought to be disgusted by it   He has a beastly, amoral kleptocratic malignantly narcissistic Twitter ad and we all know that   The Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Charles Schumer style Democrats remind us of that every day how awful it is   Somehow that doesn t seem to stop the Democrats from voting this horrible malignant narcissist unlimited Pentagon funds, unlimited defense authorizations, unlimited surveillance powers   It s really strange   I don t know how they main that maintain that schizophrenia CH: But what Trump does, which solidifies his base, is he expresses a legitimate rage at a system that has betrayed most Americans   And however crude and infantile he is, at least he expresses a hatred for a system that has thrust a knife in the back of working men and women PS: Well, I think that s exactly right   And, you know, 2016 was an anti establishment election   There were three viable candidates, I suppose two viable and one semi viable candidate, named Bernie Sanders   Two of them were technically could be called anti establishment candidates of the sort   There s limits in both the cases of Sanders and Trump with regard to that but they ran rather aggressively and rather explicitly as anti establishment candidates telling people they were getting shafted as most working people know they are in this country   This is a country after all where the top tenth of the upper one percent has as much wealth as the bottom ninety percent of the country   Was it we heard the other day at the Left Forum that three people now are wealthy enough that they own as much money as much net worth as the bottom half of the population   Wages have been stagnating, not just since the Great Recession but really across the entire long neoliberal era   Unions have been knocked down to six percent of the workforce   I was born into a country where it was 35% of the workforce and you can go on and on with these sort of savage disparities, both class disparities and racial disparities, and people are getting absolutely screwed   Hillary Clinton wouldn t didn t have the common decency to say that   Bernie Sanders at least pointed out with all his limits, ran consistently against plutocracy and against the billionaire class and against the one percent and told overflowing audiences, particularly when he was running for himself he had overflowing audiences   And then when he was sheepdog in front of Hillary Clinton, he had audiences about third a third the size, but he said consistently you re being screwed over by the capitalist elite   They didn t quite use that language but that s what the one percent really is   Donald Trump s told people they were being shafted and he blamed as does the right wing and Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe right now, he blamed immigrants     He placed a heavy emphasis on racialized, ethnicized evil others CH: But he PS: from outside, but he at least told people they were being shafted   He was channeling anger CH: He did blame Wall Street   I mean, he did blame Goldman Sachs by name PS: And he threw in a significant amount of populist anger and I thought actually quite cleverly under the influence of Bannon played class too   Played class anger and made this promise to make America great again which really, in essence, was an appeal to the flyover zones, the deindustrialized regions of this country, the regions that went through farm crisis   Basically it was a promise to magically, and it and Trump is very much about magical thinking CH: All totalitarian demagoguery about magical thinking PS: Absolutely   But the magical thinking related to a socioeconomic reality which is in essence which was essentially deindustrialization and neoliberal globalization   Not just globalization but globalization under the under the command of capital, which has destroyed employment in the farm and equipment industry CH: And you live you live in Iowa, so you see ot PS: Yeah   Waterloo in Iowa where people used to be able to go to high school and go straight into the John Deere or the International Harvester Plant and make a decent living   Same thing in the Quad Cities   Janesville, Wisconsin, you know, General Motors, you can just you can go down the list   And what Trump what Trump was really saying in essence is that he was going to magically recreate the lost golden age of American mass production industrial supremacy which, of course, is a completely fantastic thing to promise and absolutely it s not going to happen because the whole winds of the world capitalist system have shifted and they ve shifted a long time ago but that resonated and it was smart   Trump was not a complete idiot   Between that and playing the evangelical Right which had all kinds of reasons to be scared of him, but he cut a deal with them and it was pretty clever   He gave them the vice presidency and he basically gave them veto power over the reconstitution of the CH: Well, he PS: of the federal bench CH: Well, he also allows the federal society and PS: The federal society CH: [INDISTINCT] stack the course PS: Exactly CH: I mean, not just the Supreme Court but PS: Right   And the and the amazing thing in the 2016 Election is Donald Trump, the reality television character and the real estate magnate who s kind of like a bumbling billionaire Archie Bunker, talked more about policy   This has been documented in numerous political science studies   He actually discussed policy maybe in a hand fisted way about five times as often as did the Yale law graduate and policy wonk Hillary Clinton CH: She almost never talked about policy PS: Who almost never talked about policy as Bernie Sanders confidentially told one of his supporters in Iowa City a week before the election, he said, She s not talking about policy   She s just running on Trump is terrible, Trump is terrible   He s bad   He s mean and he s and he s not qualified to be the President CH: But one and PS: She ran on candidate character and she had a horrible candidate character herself   Right CH: And I think she was actually considering the slogan, Because it s her turn   I mean, can you imagine seriously?   Am I correct about that?   I think that s correct PS: Which resonates with absolutely nobody outside of some, you know CH: By the [INDISTINCT] Foundation   Right PS: campus town highlights, and campus town highly identity politicized feminist academicians might ve fallen through that but, you know, I mean CH: I want to go back to the left PS: Sure CH: Because everything, of course, you say is true   And yet the left seems utterly in a unable to see it or accept it emotionally or what and I think you re right to even question whether there is a left in the United States   But let s go back to profile what the self identified left is and what s happened to it PS: Well, there s many lefts   I don t think we really have a left and it s hard to get a handle on it   I mean, you know, if you listen to some of my relatives at family gatherings, it s anybody who isn t a Republican   I mean, it s literally anybody who doesn t like Trump, anyone that doesn t like the right wing agenda so that s the Democrats and that s just absolutely farcical and preposterous because we know about their policy record over the last few decades   The left refers to that primarily in the mainstream discourse, there is a there is a unofficially sort of Marxist or Marxist Leninist, sometimes Trotskyist Left that you can look up the names of their organizations on Wikipedia, you know, and it runs 15 to 20 deep and they seem more involved in sectarian squabbling with each other than actually doing anything to fight capital or fight capitals   I have to be careful about that   I know some good people in Socialist Alternative   I know some good people in ISO   None of them have any particular kind of, you know, mass membership at all   There s a number of there s the Sanders progressives within the Democratic Party who just unfortunately sort of worship this supposedly independent political candidate from Vermont who s really actually been a de facto Democrat since the 1990s and actually cut a deal with the mainstream Democratic Party up there to squelch independent third party politics CH: And in return, they would not mount a serious challenge to a Senator PS: Exactly   And he s a curious leftist who repeatedly cites Scandinavia as his social Democratic role model and never once likes to mention that they spend three to four percent of their national budgets in Norway and Sweden and Denmark on the military whereas the United States spends 57% of its discretionary budget on the military, which completely cancels out the progressive domestic agenda that he claims he s for   So you have the Sandernistas   Now many of those have gotten many of his younger followers are starting to get a clue and angry about that betrayal   In fact, they were angry about it at the time   You just spoke to somebody who led a walkout at the Democratic National Convention and that s very help and need to see   Some of them are going into burgeoning new chapters of the Democratic socialists of America, which still seems attached to a working from within   They re having debates about this   I think DSA is something I tell leftists, You ought to go into and see what s going on   It s fluid   It s not necessarily CH: But in the organization, many people may not PS: Well, it s there was the old DSA, which was run by Michael Harrington and a sort of a bunch of sort of CH: You re talking about Democratic Socialists of America? PS: Cold War leftists   DSA, Democratic Socialists of America CH: I ve been to meetings where PS: You have   Uh hmm CH: half of the room was empty and it s not a big room PS: And it s not well, I hear different things from different chapters, but at the end of the day, they seem to be they re ready to knock on doors for some damn neoliberal in a congressional midterm in 2018   Yeah CH: We re going to come back to that PS: Yeah CH: When we return, we ll continue our conversation about the ruling elite and resistance with Paul Street  Welcome back to On Contact   We continue our conversation with Paul Street   I see the left a kind of political immaturity within the left, do you? PS: I ve seen a fair amount of political immaturity on the left, yeah   There s a there s an ignorance about the history of the Democratic Party   People young people sometimes look at me sort of cluelessly when I say I ve been hearing this about how you re going to return the Democratic Party back to its Franklin Delano Roosevelt origins and fight the good fight for the for the working man or the working people   I ve been hearing that all my life and I don t see that happening this time   I try and tell them the Democratic Party, at the end of the day, it s not it s not so much feckless or stupid   It s not that it doesn t know how to win, it s corrupt   It s owned by a small it s owned by a small cadre of campaign donors by the unelected dictatorship of money, which runs both parties in this country and it has a business model   They re full grown adults   They know what they re doing   They know what they re about   And they would rather lose to the right wing, even a neo fascistic, Christian, eco apocalyptic right wing dedicated to burning every last fossil fuel on this planet I guess which will bring us closer to the Christian Armageddon and we ll find out who s saved and who s the damned   They d rally they d rather give up the lose to that horrific hyper dangerous right wing Republican Party than lose even to a mildly progressive social democratic left within their own party   And they ve shown this consistently again and yet people still cling to the notion that they can do that   There are other parts of the left that worship violence and destruction of property and all the kinds of things that I could tell you stories of incidents of that kind of activities CH: They talk about antifa black bloc PS: That just ends up yeah   And that just ends up feeding the right   That just ends up creating sort of Facebook advertisement clip for CH: Well, half of them half of them are cops anyway, so   Let s go back PS: There certainly, there is that, yeah CH: Let s go back to that issue you just spoke about with the Democratic Party   Why would they rather lose? PS: Well, because at the end of the day, it s really about rotating out of your two or three years in Congress and starting to make real money in a lobbying firm on K Street or maybe even directly in finance capital   Because there s a there s this whole series and set of class associations and oligarchic connections beneath and behind the superficial surface state drama of electoral competition   There s really a class system beneath and behind that   And you can t make real money   You can t really set your own children up for a success in this increasingly hyper inegalitarian, oligarchic society by fighting the good fight   That s not what it s about CH: We know Barney Frank s working for a bank PS: Well there you go, yeah CH: He d have kids, but PS: Right CH: Yeah PS: Right CH: He s working for a bank PS: Right   And it could the corporate elite does not just control the political process in this country through campaign contributions alone   Probably the revolving door and the rotating out of political office into working for banks or for lobbying firms is more relevant than that   There s all kinds of ways that the capital runs the show, the staffing of administrations, the threat to go on capital strike if a policymaker gets in and does things the capital doesn t like   You know, it s entirely conceivable that had the Clintonites not been able to fully rig the Democratic Party   And to prevent Sanders who really went incredibly far in the primaries with almost no campaign finance support at all from business on the basis of small donations   It s entirely possible that Bernie Sanders could have defeated Donald Trump in the 2016 election, but could he really have done anything? CH: No, he would have been utterly paralyzed PS: Much of anything?   He would have been utterly paralyzed   He would have demonized in the media   Wall Street would ve had a very negative investment response   He would ve been blamed for that response   If anything, it might very well have been a fiasco which would then be taken to prove that the progressive agenda is an absolute disaster for the for the country   So, in a sense, we may have almost dodged a bullet for Sanders not getting in CH: Lenin, what must be done? PS: Right   Well, you know, Lenin, What must be done? I ve always, for many years, loved and attended numerous Noam Chomsky lectures about the 85 different forms of imperialist evil   And actually, Noam talks a great deal about domestic evil, too   I ve always wondered could you give Noam particularly since wherever you go you can draw an audience of 10,000 people   Or if you go to Noam Chomsky lecture, there s lines around the block, could you give the last 10 minutes of it to what needs to be done?   And Noam s answer has always been that that s almost an inherently authoritarian CH: Yeah, although he just PS: and an inherently Leninist question   And it isn t CH: But he has addressed the issue   I mean, he it s not that he s ignored it, but go ahead PS: Well, he s certainly advanced   He s declared himself a left and then I have some of those same sympathies for myself and he s pointed out that a lot of the people that tell us we are habitually, on the left, told that we have no solution whatsoever, that we re just nattering nabobs of negativity and that we re just antis   We re not for anything   And there s a great line in one of Chomsky s books and it s called failed states in 06, which is there s a translation for that charge   You have alternatives and we don t like them, you know?   And we have a list of policy measures that is, you know, 40 pages long that had that s been round on the left forever   We do have all kinds of progressive things   We want a financial transaction tax   We want single payer health insurance   We want to re legalize union organizing in this country, want major green jobs programs   We want to slash the Pentagon budget and redirect those resources to a real welfare state and to environmental rebuilding and remake, all of that   You go through the list CH: Nationalizing the banks? PS: Glen Ford s issue that he brought up so wonderfully and eloquently at the Left Forum, nationalize the banks which, as he pointed out, everybody hates in this country   Everybody hates the banks   That list is long   We also have visions of an alternative society beyond the inherent sociopathic CH: Which brings me to left because we do have the vision right but Lenin points out what we don t have CH: When and what a lot of people don t know is that that Lenin s What Is to be Done  And you don t have to be a Leninist to value this question, it s not it s not about what the reform proposals are, it s not about a vision of alternative society, it s about actually the main thing that s missing in the United States right now, which is an organized, through thick and thin, durable institutionalized left, an actual organization that s there   You know, back in the day, you just have a mimeograph that s a lot of us hate to admit it, but back in the day that was the Communist Party   You know, when the cops came to a Victor family in the black ghetto in Chicago on the south side, someone will come out and run and say, Quick, run and get the Reds   And then people knew where to go, and they knew to get over to 47th and Wabash and knock on the door and find some sparkplug militants, some effective organizers   A lot of a lot of the rank and file organizers in the Communist Party didn t give a damn about the Stalinist politics of the party headquarters in New York City   They would have been anarchists or syndicalist if that had been the main organization on the left   And these great organizers come over and organize popular rebellions and put all the furniture that the cops had taken out of the apartment and they put it right back in   We don t have anything like that anymore, you know?   We re like the Black Panther Party which was an attempt to provide direct service with education programs and free breakfast programs and all of that   We don t have that   Those particularly the Communist Party was there through thick and thin   It wasn t just episodic, we re gonna have a march against the WTO or against NATO and then, you know, really ever since the McCarthy era, I m afraid, we ve kind of had this episodic CH: Oh, wait, wait, what PS: movement, you know, demonstration addicted kind of left, yeah CH: But we lost historical and it seems, we ve lost the historical knowledge of how to organize, haven t we?   The old CIO model PS: Oh, I think that s true, right, where you start with issues that really matter to real people, to working people CH: Let s start PS: And then you build from there   Yeah CH: I don t want to keep interrupting but the PS: Sure CH: which means don t demonize Trump supporters   Don t write them off as racist yahoos PS: Oh, absolutely   Yeah, Trump supporters are responding to a kind of vacuum, you know, a vacuum of basic sort of left organizing, certainly a vacuum of union organizing and certainly, you know, the disappearing I would sort of nominate the disappearance of the labor movement   And maybe that s a bit strong but the decimation of the labor movement is one of the most underestimated factors in American political life   That is a really big deal that we ve gone from CH: Because they had knowledge   I mean, you can go back and look at some of those old manuals in the 30s, they d lace it out PS: Right   Right   And that made a case to white working class people   I don t like the phrase white working class, but there is a good component of the working class that is Caucasian, that too much of the left spends time demonizing and calling inherently privileged just because they re white   Even though white working class lifespans are now falling which is something we ve never seen   Even though many of them have less than $500 worth of savings and are living from paycheck to paycheck worrying about whether they can meet a mortgage payment or rent payment   It s less time you know, that the old organizers knew that you had to have conversations with them, not about their privilege and how well off they were but about their self interest in reaching out across racial and ethnic lines and forming solidarity associations, and with people who that they couldn t advance their own interests unless they were allied with and instead we have a kind of hyper identicized political left which tends to give people lectures about things like intersectionality which is sort of a term that nobody outside of academia really understands, foundations like it and all of that   What was wrong with solidarity?   I mean that s tricky because the workplaces that used to exist that made a evident logic of solidarity between workers of different races have gone away to   I think deindustrialization is part of that CH: Well and you have organizations like Walmart that have structured workplace to essentially make any kind of organizing impossible PS: Oh, absolutely CH: You know, they ve instituted systems by which at the first sign of any kind of organizing, those who are doing that organizing are immediately eradicated and we ve just watched an assault on public sector unions which is PS: The last CH: It s almost the last read out PS: The last outpost of the American labor movement, that s why it s being so specifically targeted state by state, and at the state level which is very underestimated level of American politics   Absolutely   There s a good book to be written by somebody with a title like the war on solidarity, about all the various new and different kinds of ways in which anything even smacking of solidarity is nipped in the bud in advanced because it can even happen   Even to down to the level of how workplaces are structured and how the work process is structured   I used to teach in Industrial Relations Institute   I was like the one token Marxist and I d interesting conversations with other professors there whose whole mission in life was union avoidance and union destruction   They literally were trying to cubicleize, you know, they re advancing theories about how to cubicleize the workforce as much possible, and take away the instinct towards solidarity that happens when you have whole groups of people doing the same job and how can we get it, as how can we make as many jobs just one person doing that job   So now that garbage trucks that go around and pick up the trash and the recycling in towns and cities, all over the country are just one person with an electronic arm and all of that   So, yeah CH: Great   All right   Thanks, Paul   That was author Paul Street   Thank you for watching PS: Thank you very much, Chris CH: Great   Thanks PS: That was fun RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/473004-paul-street-american-left/
"23 Oct, 2019","B***h, please! Banning âsexistâ language wonât make sexism disappear, any more than banning racial slurs killed racism","A Massachusetts congressman wants to end sexism by punishing sexist language specifically the word b***h  with fines and even jail But policing speech doesn t kill the underlying sentiment that requires real social change Massachusetts Democrat Daniel Hunt s bill to ban the b word,  fining offenders $150 on the first offense and $200 or six months in prison if they can t stop saying it, sounds like the kind of joke conservatives might make to poke fun at the uber liberal Bay State But the bill titled An act regarding the use of offensive words is real  Worse, any witness to the use of the word can complain A person who uses the word bitch directed at another person to accost, annoy, degrade or demean the other person shall be considered to be a disorderly person Hunt s bill, which he insists was submitted at the request of a constituent, is far from the only example of the Democratic Party clutching its pearls over speech while giving the sentiment beneath that speech a pass A vocal segment of the Left has become notorious as America s speech police,  calling out offenses real and imagined on social media and inciting outrage mobs to force apologies out of celebrities and businesses, sometimes sincere but often perfunctory and defensive Criminalizing sexist  language to curb sexism reverses cause and effect Martin Luther King Jr wouldn t have gotten very far during the Civil Rights era had he merely strived to end the use of racial slurs in order to achieve equality for the races Such words are no longer acceptable to use because of significant organizing, marching, and other forms of protest from sit ins to boycotts Social change comes first language is just a reflection of societal norms Yet liberals seem to have forgotten even that College students and professors at the University of Connecticut turned out in protest earlier this week, demanding the arrest of two students who were overheard calling each other racial slurs in a vulgar word game The mob didn t stop to realize that the slur once a commonplace insult directed at black people is now considered an obscenity thanks to the strides American society has made toward equality The students were using it to shock rather like someone yelling b***h  in a public place Politicians should have a better grasp of history than college students, but this is not always the case Earlier this week, Democratic congressman Al Green pounced on President Donald Trump for comparing his impeachment probe to a lynching  Green, who is black, excoriated the president for appropriating his racial history even though the word simply means an extrajudicial execution by a mob, and Democrats used it to defend their own president Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1999 Green s histrionics allowed Congress to avoid addressing the president s point that his impeachment investigation was proceeding at record speed, with little regard for legal precedent, and that it put future presidents in jeopardy This is the usual outcome of speech policing: bringing down an outrage mob on the head of whoever used the forbidden word, while utterly obscuring the context and negating any point they may have been making It s not that there isn t room for improvement in the US with regard to gender and racial equality Congress should it desire could pass laws to help reduce the racialdisparitiesin criminal convictions and sentencing, instead of demanding (in California, at least) that felons be referred to as justice involved persons  so as not to offend their delicate sensibilities It could mandate paid maternity leave like the rest of the developed world, giving women more opportunities to advance in the workplace without penalizing them for giving birth; instead, some states (California again) mandate de gendering  of job titles like postman, policeman, and fireman But playing speech police is the easy way to signal virtue, while changing social norms is difficult Massachusetts b***h bill is clearly unconstitutional, civil rights attorney Harvey Silverglate told the Herald, and fortunately Hunt is getting some pushback from his fellow legislators Given the current state of affairs, though, it s only a matter of time before the speech police strike again ByHelen Buyniski, RT If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"18 Aug, 2019",Max Blumenthal on international jihadism,"Host Chris Hedges talks to author and journalist Max Blumenthal about the intimate connection between the misguided support the United States has given to international Jihadism starting with over $1billion Washington gave to the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1970s and the rise of neo fascists and ultra nationalist movements in Europe and the US Blumenthal s new book The Management of Savagery: How America s National Security State Fueled the Rise of Al Qaeda, ISIS, and Donald Trump was published in April by Verso Books YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud com/rttv/sets/on contact CH:Welcome to On Contact   Today, we discuss how 9/11 and the military interventions in the Middle East made possible the election of Donald Trump with author Max Blumenthal MB: After the anti Soviet jihad that the CIA backed in Afghanistan, many of these figures came back to the US, including Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind the so called Blind Sheikh, who had been sent to Afghanistan by the CIA and entered New York on a CIA visa to a place called the Al Kifah Center which was in Jersey City   I actually live down the street from its former location for several years   And Al Kifah the Al Kifah Center was basically an al Qaeda cell in New York overseen by the FBI and the CIA CH:Well, in it there is an imminent connection between the misguided support the United States has given to international jihadism starting with the over $1,000,000,000 Washington gave to the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1970 s and the rise of neo fascist, an ultranationalist movement in Europe and the United States   The long collusion by the CIA and the US military with jihadists in Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya has led to a series of failed states that has equipped and trained a generation of radicalized jihadists who have turned on their former sponsors and brought their finely honed terrorism skills back to plague Europe and the United States   It has spawned a massive refugee crisis, which coupled with the economic dislocation caused by neoliberalism, has empowered the xenophobia and violence of the far right   The folly of our national security policy led directly to the rise of Osama bin Laden, the attacks of 9/11, ISIS, and ultimately the empowerment of demagogues, such as Donald Trump   Joining me in the Washington studio to discuss these issues is Max Blumenthal, author of Management of Savagery, How America s National Security State Fueled the Rise of al Qaeda, ISIS, and Donald Trump   Beginning of the book, you say that you are set out to make the case that Trump s election would not have been possible without 9/11 and the subsequent military interventions conceived by the National Security State   Explain MB: Well, it s it is definitely something that I set out to explain and it s not the only reason I think Trump was elected   I mean, you ve made the case, Trump Chris, that, you know, the financial crisis and, you know, neoliberal austerity has been a big factor in Trump s rise  But Islamophobia and this kind of transatlantic axis between the European far right and Trump s understanding of right wing populism was a big factor in Trump s rise   And I talk in the book about how Trump how close he was to the ground in New York City on the day of 9/11 and how close he was to one host in particular who was the number one drive time host in the United States CH:Howard Stern MB: Howard Stern   Trump was kind of, at the time, struggling with his businesses and he was going on Howard Stern to stay relevant   And when the first plane hit the World Trade Center, it was Howard Stern live on the air who conveyed what was taking place to New Yorkers and he was actually joking that it was Pam Anderson s jet because he was in the middle of a yarn about hanging out at a seedy midtown bar called Scores and hitting on Pam Anderson   And for a few minutes, Stern was joking about the attack and then he delves into a genocidal tirade with his co host, Robin Quivers   We ve got to bomb the hell out of them   We ve got to bomb everything over there   There has to be a war   We have to drop chemical weapons on them and burn their eyes out   This is the language of Howard Stern   Donald Trump was close to this atmosphere and he understood that Stern came out of that broadcast as somebody who had captured the hearts and minds of many New Yorkers and people across the US   And he adopted that language in his subsequent campaigns   And then there was Dan Rather who appeared on Dave Letterman   Dan Rather, you know, not exactly a hardcore neocon, just a trusted voice of evening news   On David Letterman, a week later, he emerges basically from nonstop newscast shell shocked   He looked completely tired and he said that Arabs had been celebrating the attacks from across the river, Arab Americans in New Jersey   Remember, Donald Trump deployed this lie, this trope during his 2016 campaign and all the fact checkers tried to show that it was false, that it never took place   And Trump s fans said, Well, actually Dan Rather said this a week after 9/11    So it s the culture of 9/11 that s still with us today, that kind off exterminationist, Islamophobic culture that grew out of the attacks of 9/11 and what I set out to do in this book is show how it wasn t Donald Trump s fault that 9/11 took place   It was, of course, al Qaeda s fault, but it was also the fault of the National Security State Mandarins who are so opposed to Trump these days and see him as a rogue figure CH:You talk about Israel in the book and Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, and how he articulated much of this, this vision of what you call a global struggle between the civilized Judeo Christian west and the Barbaric eastern hordes    And that when the War on terror begins,  they really George W Bush and others, including Donald Trump, adopt this Netanyahu narrative and this language MB: Yeah, I my book starts in 1979, two years after I was born at the point of what I consider this major historic rupture which led to 9/11 and helped bring us to where we are today, the Iranian Revolution, which caused this freak out in the US with an Islamic Revolutionary government coming to power   The Siege of the Great Mosque in Saudi Arabia which led to the Faustian bargain between the Saudi Royal Court and the Wahhabi clergy in which the Saudi Royal Court committed to spending billions to project their vision abroad CH:Look, let me just back up because you explained in the book that there was an occupation of the mosque and you re not allowed to employ acts of violence in this sacred space   And so they had to get a cleric to pass a fatwa or a ruling that permitted them to crush it and the deal, the Faustian bargain that you point out, is that they would fund these highly conservative, is the wrong word, you know, kind of fanatic, Islamic charities and allow them to project that radical jihadism outwards in Pakistan and everywhere else MB: Right   And Juhayman Otaybi, who led the Siege of the Great Mosque, had a following that the Saudi Royal Court was deeply worried about and he said these are corrupt figures who are hanging out on yachts and spending all their money on prostitutes CH:With all of which I would say is true MB: Which is all true   And, you know, that fell on fertile soil with, you know, common people in Saudi Arabia, including someone who was part very close to the royal court, a young Osama bin Laden   So, it relieved the pressure internally in Saudi Arabia to send these young men to Afghanistan   But back to your original question about Israel, it was also in 1979 that a young Benjamin Netanyahu began holding a series of conferences under the auspices of the Jonathan Institute named after his late brother, Yonatan Netanyahu, who was killed in the Entebbe Raid in which western elites, major figures from the Beltway Press Corps, figures like George H W Bush, longtime CIA Chief, were hosted in Israel and elsewhere for conferences on the concept of terrorism, which was new to the American public   And their job was to convey the Israeli understanding of terrorism back to the western public, which set the stage for this understanding of the clash of civilizations between, as you said, the Judeo Christian west and the Islamic hordes or the Arab hordes CH:And this becomes popularized by Samuel Huntington at Harvard in his book The Clash of Civilizations which essentially repeated this narrative   And then the US signs on for this holy war  And ¦ MB: Right   In 1979   Zbigniew Brzezinski makes the decision CH:So, the author of the book, I m just going to say one, there s a $51,000,000 grant from the United States agency for International Development to the University of Nebraska s Center for Afghan Studies   And they create four million third grade textbooks that help transform Afghan schools into jihadist indoctrination centers MB: Yeah   I was you know, let me I was actually looking to for the quote, but I think I can I can remember it by heart   It s an arithmetic question that appears in one of these third grade textbooks CH:It s right here   One group of mujahideen attacks fifty Russian soldiers   In that attack, 20 Russians are killed   How many Russians fled?    This is from a textbook that is being printed in the United States in for Afghan ¦ MB: Funded to the tune of $51,000,000 by the US Agency for International Development to a professor named Thomas Gutier who was one of the premier Afghan experts and was essentially a CIA Asset at the University of Nebraska   These textbooks were delivered to schools operating in areas held by the CIA backed mujahideen as well as in refugee camps in Pakistan that were being used as way stations for the CIA backed anti Soviet jihad   And they encouraged children to become insurgents and set the stage for generational violence and disruption   And they were recycled   When the Taliban took over Afghanistan after the Soviet backed government fell, and the Taliban basically swept out these CIA backed warlords, the US proceeded to support the Taliban, something that s been whitewashed from history because the Taliban protected Unocal s pipeline   And the one thing the Taliban did was they wiped out the human images that were in these USAID textbooks, but just use them as they were and they provided a perfect, you know, a perfect indoctrination books for the kind of society the Taliban wanted to build CH:And this creates a term I had was not aware of before, a disposal problem in the words of US officials   Explain what that is and what the ramifications were MB: Well, the disposal problem was something that I spoke to Jack Bloom about who was the investigator for the Senate Select committee on the CIA and the US s role in importing drugs from Central America into the US, Iran Contra, and on the US role in funding Salafi jihadi elements in Afghanistan   Bloom explained it as, you know, in terms of the Cold War, the first disposal problem was in Miami when the Cuban extremists that we trained for the Bay of Pigs came back and we had to basically give them something to do   In this case ¦ CH:Let me just interrupt because there was a series of bombings in Miami MB: And here in Washington CH:Against that s right   Against people who were considered sympathetic to the Cuban regime MB: Cubana flight 455 was brought down by a CIA asset, Orlando Bosch, and Bosch was honored by Governor Jeb Bush with Orlando Bosch Day in Miami   You know, after the anti Soviet jihad that the CIA backed in Afghanistan, many of these figures came back to the US, including Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind the so called Blind Sheikh who had been sent to Afghanistan by the CIA and entered New York on a CIA visa to a place called the Al Kifah Center, which was in Jersey City   I actually live down the street from its former location for several years   And Al Kifah the Al Kifah Center was basically an al Qaeda cell in New York overseen by the FBI and the CIA CH:Well, there s many instances that you document in the book of these jihadists who have turned against the United States but because they had prior relationships either with the FBI or the CIA, they re actually protected by those organizations MB: Right   So Ali Mohamed was being protected throughout the 90s   He had actually given sessions for army officers on the Arab mind  at the JFK School of Special Warfare while he was working for Zawahiri   He was detained by Canadian Mounted Police at an airport in Canada because of his connections to al Qaeda   And an FBI agent actually called and said let him go when he when the figures who were eventually put on trial who are part of Al Kifah and were eventually prosecuted went to court and were defended by a lawyer named Roger Stavis, Stavis attempted to put the CIA on trial and Stavis told me his line throughout the entire trial was Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Afghanistan, what these guys were doing was serving the United States and you cannot prosecute them as terrorists   You have no right to do so   And Stavis s defense actually was so dangerous to the United States that when he called Ali Abdul Saoud Mohamed to the stand, the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, told Mohamed, Do not show up, do not appear   It s too embarrassing for us, the United States government, to know what you re doing    Meanwhile, Ali Mohamed was still out there working with al Qaeda CH:Great   When we come back, we continue our conversation about America s role in the rise of radical jihadists with Max Blumenthal   Welcome back to On Contact   We continue our conversation about America s role in the rise of radical jihadists with author Max Blumenthal   So, you write about a report, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm   Talk about that MB: This was a white paper put forward to Benjamin Netanyahu by Richard Perle and Douglas Feith, two figures who would prove key in the invasion of Iraq and stove piping false intelligence to George W Bush who were, at the time, at the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, and an Israeli funded think tank   And they put this paper together to layout Benjamin Netanyahu s regional strategy as he entered the Prime Minister s Office for the first time   And what it called for essentially was taking all the enemies of Israel that provided strategic depth to Iran, particularly Syria, but also Iraq, and placing them in the crosshairs of regime change and fragmenting them in order to destroy their societies from within   And so one thing that this Clean Break document calls for is using the Sunni Arab tribes in Northeastern Syria as a kind of proxy to undermine a government that was controlled by an Alawite president   And what did that what later took place in Northeastern Syria?   Well, as we now know, the rise of ISIS took place with some support from those Sunni Arab tribes   So, basically what they were laying out was what later took form in the Syrian proxy war, in the proxy war in Libya, and of course the invasion of Iraq   And it was all done in their minds to benefit Israel and weaken all of its regional enemies CH:Well, there s constant examples in the book of direct collusion between the CIA and the United States, and even Israel, and these jihadist forces   They are they will they will use them at certain moments, Syria would be a good example, when they think they will benefit that geopolitical goal of destabilizing these states MB: Israel has admitted recently to even establishing a Free Syrian Army group to undermine the Assad government in Syria, in the Golan Region, Fursan al Joulan, The Knights of Golan   Some of these fighters were reputed to have been paid $3,000 a month by Israel   They were armed by Israel   But there were other instances where Israel was literally providing air cover and artillery cover to ISIS   Israel negotiated a ceasefire with ISIS in the Golan   And Moshe Alon, who was the former Defense Minister of Israel, actually openly said, If it comes to a choice between Assad and ISIS, I prefer ISIS   Why?   Because these Israel, like the United States, aims to take all of the stable secular Arab states that are independent and that resisted sphere of influence, and weaken them from within    And that s where ISIS and al Qaeda have the function of doing   That s why we have supported them since the anti Soviet jihad CH:And arm which means arming them MB: Arming them with high powered weaponry starting with Stinger missiles in Afghanistan CH:The White Helmets I mean, when you talk about Israel when finally, the Assad, with Russian support and Iranian support, managed to push or recapture the territory, Israel actually extracts The White Helmets   Talk a little bit about you wrote extensively about it, but talk a little bit about how they served western propaganda s interest and that extraction itself is an illustration of the close relationship, because The White Helmets, as you point out, were very tied to the jihadists, the close relationship between Israel and these jihadist MB: Well, The White Helmets are the most, I would say, the most cynical humanitarian interventionist scam perpetrated on the west in out lifetimes CH:Explain for viewers who what reportedly what they do and who they are MB: Well, let me let me let me just explain why they are what they are   You know, the US embarked on a over $1,000,000,000 multibillion dollar arm and equip program of Syrian non moderate insurgents called Operation Timber Sycamore   And it allowed insurgents to seize territory, including five neighborhoods in East Aleppo, now the entire province of Idlib is under insurgent control   Raqqa was under control of ISIS   These areas were controlled by al Qaeda s local affiliate, Javid Al Isra and its allies   And it was not a pretty thing for the western media to show the western public that the US was arming these elements who were embarking on a process of Talibanization, as the Professor Joshua Landis called it, where Christians were ethnically cleansed, where Jews were killed and forced to unbury their dead, where women were put in fifth class status   And so we needed to look at something else, so let s look at rescuers, let s look at people who are rescuing children from bombs and let s just say that Assad isn t trying to recapture territory from Salafi jihadi elements   Let s say that he is bombing his own people because he s a bloodthirsty cat petting dictator, and that these heroes are rushing in with their white helmets just to save the children, and these heroes happen to have cameras, advanced HD cameras to show us this and to give it to media which is unable to enter these areas because so many western journalists have been kidnapped and killed, and even in the case of James Foley, beheaded   And what I have showed in my journalism and what other independent journalists have showed is that The White Helmets have operated exclusively alongside al Qaeda and even ISIS as their ancillaries, as their public relations team with $23,000,000, now it s $35,000,000 from USAID, the same group that supplied those textbooks in Afghanistan, and $55,000,000 ollars from the British Foreign Office, and untold sums from Qatar   Their documentary, propaganda documentary about them, won an Oscar at Netflix   They have won the they ve been nominated for the Nobel Prize   And what they have aimed to do in practice is to convince the western public that we need to bomb Syria and invade Syria in order to save the children   We need to do something   And they ve almost succeeded CH:Well, they keep calling for a no fly zone MB: A no fly zone CH:Which Hillary Clinton and others have adopted MB: And ¦ CH:Which means that ¦ MB: Which Hillary Clinton, by the way, in a private speech admitted would kill a lot of Syrians CH:And that essentially means the Assad Air Force cannot fly over that zone   s MB: Nor can the Russian Air Force CH:Nor can the Russians? MB: So, we ve seen generals admit in testimony in the in the Senate that that would mean a hot war with Russia and Syria   So, The White Helmets actually exist to promote and stimulate support for war   Not only that, White Helmet leader Raed al Saleh, has repeatedly been to Washington to lobby for sanctions on Syria, which took the form of the so called Caesar Bill, and he was lobbying one of the most pro Israel members of Congress, Eliot Engel   These sanctions have had a terrible, devastating impact on the lives of ordinary Syrians who are now facing a gas heating crisis and have had trouble heating their homes for the past few months because of the Caesar Bill, because of what The White Helmets lobbied for   So, I ask everyone what kind of rescue group, which was nominated for Nobel Prize and essentially won an Oscar, is fighting to bomb their own countrymen and sanction ordinary people in their own country? CH:You say in the book Islamophobia had become the language of a wounded empire, the guttural roar of its malevolent violence, turned back from the sands of Iraq and the mountain passes of Afghanistan, and leveled against the mosque down the turnpike, the Hijabi in the checkout line, the Sikh behind the cash register, the neighbors who looked like the enemy   The very hard war between Muslims and westerners that a member of Bin Laden s inner circle had foreshadowed in 1996 was coming home    And you the management of savagery comes   I think it was an ISIS or Al Qaeda document and it s about managing savagery and destroying what they straw they described as the gray zone, that middle ground between extremists, between them and right wing extremists, those who speak like you MB: Yeah   I mean, when the National Security State emboldens Salafi jihadist elements, you have another element in the west which has risen to the fore that defines itself as the counter Jihadist element who I would call the ¦ CH:Pam Geller ¦ MB: Robert Spencer CH:Right, these absolute whack jobs MB: David Horowitz CH:Right MB: Steven Emerson   And these are the people who have profited and benefited from anti Muslim attitudes that they ve cultivated in stones ¦ CH:Let me just interrupt because you talk were when you say profit, these they re paid like a hundred thousand dollars from the FBI, and they don t know anything   I mean, I spent seven years in the Middle East   They don t speak Arabic   They don t but they but they feed this Netanyahu narrative of a clash of civilizations MB: And the FBI needs them to feed it just as the FBI itself foments Islamophobia through by entrapping young, mentally disturbed Muslim men in fake terror busts   But, you know, we think about Islamophobia as kind of this organic, you know, this organic crisis that just erupted  But we need to understand it and what I aim to do in my book is to provide political context to it   It wasn t just 9/11 that caused Islamophobia   It was a long term process carried out by this by this industry   And at the heart of it was Steven Emerson   Steven Emerson s first film was called The Terrorist Among Us  and it was primarily about, at first, a real al Qaeda cell that was overseen by the CIA and FBI, which I just spoke about, Al Kifah   And it was shown to members of Congress before 9/11   After 9/11, there was no Al Kifah, there was no Al Qaeda cell in the US, and the FBI and CIA were no longer willing to preside over such a thing   And so Emerson basically moved on to prosecute to pushing for prosecutions of Palestinian professors who had no connection to international Jihadism   And they were prosecuted   And then you had this industry explode   And the culmination, as I write in my book for the Islamophobia industry was actually the killing of Osama bin Laden   There s a really fascinating poll by an Ohio State University researcher named Erik Nisbet who just find the killing of bin Laden as a focusing event and showed that Islamophobic attitudes peaked because of Bin Laden s prominence in the media and the because of the fear that another attack would take place because people were reminded of 9/11 by this, and also because of the whole campaign to paint Obama as a Muslim CH:Let me close   You begin with your afterword   You talk about you call it the new moral panic   And we have a minute left   But this is where you say the Russiagate stuff comes from MB: Well, you know, all of these you know, the whole process of the war on terror took much longer than it should have because the National Security State is not concerned with national security   It would have never allowed bin Laden to be attached to an operation in Afghanistan, if it were   But eventually, ISIS lost momentum   The Syrian government, with its Russian ally, and with the help of Iran, defeated ISIS and al Qaeda, and the US came in with a very brutal operation on Raqqa   And so the National Security State pivoted   And in the Trump National Security Doctrine announced by Defense Secretary James Mattis, we saw no mention of ISIS in 2018   It was about Russia and China   We re back to a much more comfortable position for the National Security State to a great power conflict, in which we will continue to see these proxy wars to wear down the states that we can t confront directly   And that s where Russiagate comes in   Russiagate is the sort of political background noise of a great power conflict that justifies intervention, that justifies proxy wars, that justifies NATO expansion CH:Well but that s also failed, as you point out, in your book MB: You know, I wouldn t call it a failure   I mean I d like to take a victory lap and say I m vindicated for saying that Mueller would come up with nothing, that there s no collusion with Trump   But this has been a great victory for elements in the CIA, who are now, you know, working as MSNBC contributors CH:Right MB: This has been a great victory for a National Security State that needed to transition from the war on terror to something much bigger   And they knew exactly what they were doing when they got into this, and ginned up things like the Steele dossier and pushed this narrative   And it s not going to end here, and it could end very badly CH:Great   Thanks, Max   That was Max Blumenthal, author of

"12 Aug, 2019",Shocker: US perfectly capable of insanity without any Russian influence!,"America, resembling a mental patient inside some government run psychiatric ward, truly believes the Russian bogeyman is out to get it What will it take to shake the superpower from its delirium? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge The question must be finally asked on the proverbial shrink s couch if necessary if America s deep seated Russophobia, which has been gnawing away at the nation s brain since Soviet times, is symptomatic of some deeper psychological disorder After all, a nation that is loaded to the eyeballs on antidepressants, armed to the teeth with military grade weaponry and bursting at the seams with random violence could never be confused as a model sovereign state So at the risk of sounding politically incorrect, has the United States of America finally cracked? Insanity has been described, albeit a bit simplistically, as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  Does that not sound remarkably similar to the situation in which Russia now finds itself with regards to the United States? A number of Americans, and not the least educated ones, insist on seeing the distant Motherland as the evil engineer behind every problem to befall their country When Black Lives Matters protesters, for example, took to the streets to condemn excessive police force, they were not motivated to action by their own volition, of course, but rather by theinvisible handof Russia; when Instagram carried advertisements for LGBT positive sex toys,  that was the dastardly doings of Russian hackers,attemptingto sow discord  from sea to shining sea; and when Hillary Clinton suffered defeat and humiliation against Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, it was not because she was the least popular candidate; nor was it because a majority of Americans were dreaming of a wall on the porous Mexican border Of course not The reason she lost was because Russia Period Full stop End of story Any person who doubts for a nanosecond the Blame Russia narrative is hunted down by the thought police and consigned to the cuckoo s nest of conspiracy theorists, which are now ranked as potential criminals according to a new FBIprotocol This begs the question as to what will happen to the mainstream media if it is found to be guilty of disseminating a dangerous conspiracy theory You know, like Russiagate Even as the anti Russia witch hunt was finally laid to rest by the two year Mueller investigation, many Americans seem to slip further and further away from a safe space known as reality, imagining Russian fingerprints on everything where there are none Even the perennial problem of American racism, which has been around since at least the days of the African slave trade, is believed to be the dream works of the Kremlin, according to none other than Kamala Harris, a Democratic contender for the highest office in the land According to Harris, Russia exposed America s Achilles heel  of racism as a way of getting Americans going at each other  Now, thanks to such interference in the country s domestic affairs, the issue of race is a national security issue,  the leading Democrat warned According to such thick headed arguments, many decades of US racial tensions from the Civil Rights era, to the Rodney King riots, to the OJ Simpson murder trial, to the Black Lives Matters marches are all of little actual consequence The real problem is Russia flaming racial tensions on social media It takes a very special kind of mind to believe such nonsense EXCLUSIVE: Sen Kamala Harris says Russia exposed America s Achilles heel #MTP#IfItsSunday@SenKamalaHarris: For those who want to marginalize the conversation about race now it is a national security issue pic twitter com/oX5uHmDKxH Russia, the one size fits all scapegoat, can even be blamed for the apparent suicide of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein inside of a US federal prison It is not difficult to imagine that Epstein a wealthy financier who hosted members of the political elite at his private island in the Caribbean, where tales of sexcapades with underage girls are grabbing headlines was wanted dead by numerous well connected individuals Yet apparently that obvious idea never entered the brain cavity of Joe Scarborough, talking head at MSNBC, who peddled a treacherous conspiracy theory shortly after the news of Epstein s death broke A guy who had information that would have destroyed rich and powerful men s lives ends up dead in his jail cell How predictably Russian,  he tweeted to an avalanche of scorn Will the FBI be showing up at Scarborough s home any time soon to ask him a few questions? Somehow I doubt it The non stop anti Russia campaign, however, which amounts to nothing less than vulgar racism, extends beyond the borders of politics and media into the world of entertainment Consider the curious case of David Crosby, from Crosby, Stills and Nash, which, by the way, is not a Washington think tank devoted to Russia Mr Crosby, 77, is an iconic singer songwriter from the drug infused 1960s counterculture movement A two time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he enjoys well deserved fame for his musical as opposed to his political achievements So why on Earth is the mainstream media giving this entertainer a large stage to spew his ill founded opinions on Russia? Basically, the Russians take hold of any division in our society racial prejudice, class war, fear of vaccines, any division that has two sides and they work it,  Crosbywarnedin the Daily Beast They say awful stuff about whites, and then they turn around and play white supremacist KKK crazies and say we should ship all blacks back to Africa They do it with every issue they can Their plan is to divide us and render us helpless  The article goes on in a similarly insane vein, repeating long debunked cow bunk as to how Vladimir Putin had kompromat  on Donald Trump in the form of a pee tape,  which is why Trump is so completely under the control of Russia,  and other such gibberish Russians would respond to Crosby by asking why, with all this control they purportedly enjoy over the White House, does Trump continue to expand NATO up to Russia s welcome mat, while continuing with an aggressive sanctions campaign against Russian companies? If such unfounded comments prove anything, it is that the full scale media assault against Russia has worked, and many people are convinced that the Kremlin is awake at night cooking up new schemes to divide Americans against themselves My personal take on all this madness is that the liberals understand they have little chance of unseating Trump in 2020 Their candidates, as well as their platforms, inspire no confidence whatsoever I would guess they fully comprehend their desperate political state and that is why they continue to push the Trump Russia collusion conspiracy theory, which ultimately makes them appear ridiculous Never mind what it is doing to the bilateral relationship between the two nuclear armed countries Indeed, if by some unpredictable fluke of political nature the Democrats do legitimately win in 2020 and I emphasize the word legitimately I shudder to think what will transpire then between the US and Russia @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

"4 Jul, 2019",What to the slave is your Fourth of July?,"The Fourth of July is America s Independence Day, one of the most important dates in the nation s calendar, a day when myth and hypocrisy collide In 1852 Frederick Douglass, the self educated former slave and towering champion of the country s abolitionist movement, was invited to deliver the keynoteaddressat an event organized by a local anti slavery society The speech he delivered later titled What to the Slave is the Fourth of July? amounted to a searing indictment of the rank hypocrisy, which then and now describes this annual celebration to mark the country s adoption of the Declaration of Independence from the British crown in 1776 Douglass: What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that reveals to him, more than all the other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages  Slavery was formerly abolished in America at the end of a brutal and bloody civil war that raged between 1861 and 1865, pitting the free states of the North, known as the Union, against the southern slaveholding states of the short lived Confederacy This southern Confederacy, however, was merely the most obvious manifestation of the white supremacist character of a nation originally founded by white slave owners towards the end of the 18th century It is a nation whose development immediately thereafter came at the price of the extirpation and annihilation of the indigenous Indian population In the process a culture of violence and cruelty was established, reflected today in a gun culture as perverse as it is murderous Chris Hedges, in his estimable book Wages of Rebellion , examines this culture in chilling detail America has been formed and shaped by slave patrols, gunslingers, Pinkerton and Baldwin Felts detectives, gangs of strikebreakers, hired gun thugs, company militias, and the American Legion originally right wing World War I veterans who attacked union agitators Vigilante groups in America are mostly white men who often prey on people of color and radicals They are capitalism s ideological vanguard, its shock troops used to break populist movements and tyrannize the oppressed  For many people of color, police departments across America fall into the category of the vigilante groups Hedges describes, given the shocking regularity with which unarmed black males in particular are victims of police shootings andbrutality Despite the increasing polarization within American society between the super rich and everyone else, American exceptionalism, cultivated and embraced by the country s political and media class, has grown in tandem with the country s overwhelming and overweening cultural, geopolitical, economic, and military might This sense of exceptionalism rooted in a hypermasculine identity drawn from the myths surrounding the country s frontier and pioneering past has normalized and legitimized brutality and violence on a grand scale For just as police departments within the country prey on people of color in the name of law and order, the US military has been deployed over many years against countries of color in the name of hegemony, with devastating and disastrous consequences When Barack Obama, the nation s first black president, proclaimed, I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being, during a commencementaddresshe gave to graduates of the nation s elite West Point Military Academy in 2014, he did so as the president who d been party to the destruction and decimation of Libya in 2011; the president whose illegal dronewarhad killed thousands of civilians; the president who at home had failed to take any serious measures to end the mass incarceration that was introduced by his liberal progressive predecessor Bill Clinton with his notorious omnibus crime bill in 1994 In addition, Obama lauded American exceptionalism as the president who d imprisoned Chelsea Manning for exposing the extent of US war crimes and atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it was also under his watch that Edward Snowden was forced to flee and seek sanctuary in Russia for daring to reveal the existence of a program of mass surveillance by the country s National Security Agency in violation of the country s constitution This is why it s important to emphasize that Trump is not the aberration depicted by his liberal detractors He is not the crude interruption of business as usual in the land of the free He is merely its most honest face, lacking the finesse of his predecessors perhaps but completely in keeping with their willingness to assert the right of Washington to rule the world In the 1930s, retired Marine Major General Smedley Butler encapsulated the brute reality of US foreign policy in his famous anti warspeech, War Is A Racket , later expanded into a book of the same name: I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914 I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street The record of racketeering is long I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909 1912 (where have I heard that name before?) I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested  America s record of directly and indirectly overthrowing national governments in almost every part of the world is as long as it is execrable It has unleashed nuclear weapons against civilians in Japan, killed millions in Korea and Vietnam, destroyed Iraq, and as mentioned it was party to the destruction of Libya in 2011, providing succour to the most extreme and crazed terrorist organizations the world has seen In addition, Washington has over successive administrations engaged in economic warfare against multiple states at any given time, treating international law with naked and open disrespect In 1852, Frederick Douglass was under no illusions about the grim reality of America, as distinct from the myths employed to beguile its own people and people around the world into actually believing that it is the land of the free Today, in 2019, we are talking about a nation that has arguably spilled more blood and wrought more devastation than any other in human history It is why the Fourth of July should not be a day of celebration but instead a day of mourning Think your friends would be interested?

Mainstream media has put the spin machine into top gear as Joe Biden sinks in the polls Hunter, the youngest son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, has spilled his guts to the New Yorker, weaving a sordid tale of addiction, affairs, and alcoholism that the outlet has heroically tried to spin as a positive After Joe Biden s abysmal debate performance, the alleged frontrunner whom even the New York Times has admitted has all the flaws of Hillary Clinton in 2016, plus the deadly white male factor needs all the help he can get And the New Yorker has gamely tried toframethe younger Biden s troubles as a plus for dad It noted that most candidates are relentlessly bland but the former VP whom mainstream media has been consistently calling the 2020 Democratic frontrunner since his campaign launch, despite a scandal studded history that would sink multiple less well heeled candidates has responded to tragedy and learned from it  The younger Biden has admitted he missed that very campaign launch rally in May because a Breitbart story published the previous day had named him as a suspect in an Arizona narcotics probe stemming from a crack pipe discovered in his rental car It s not the first time his name has surfaced as a political liability to his father, either As Breitbart revealed earlier this year, Vice President Joe Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in US aid to Ukraine if the country did not fire its top prosecutor, apparently over his investigation of Burisma Holdings, where Hunter served as a director Hunter is super rich terrain, a cynical former Biden aide tells the New Yorker, which acknowledges the younger Biden struggled for decades with alcohol addiction and drug abuse, had a rough divorce, and an affair with his brother s widow after Beau Biden died of brain cancer, and may have fathered a child out of wedlock But Hunter is a good guy at heart, the magazine insists, so loyal that he s tried to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures by sharing them with a friendly liberal outlet instead It s not easy to spin Hunter s history A beneficiary of nepotism since his early years working for MBNA, a Delaware bank that was then the largest donor to his father s Senate campaign, his fat paycheck allowed him a well off life that the New Yorker frames as almost a cash strapped existence (sending three kids to a prestigious private school isn t cheap, and Biden is quoted as saying he lived paycheck to paycheck after he abandoned the stifling culture of MBNA to work in the Clinton administration as director of e commerce policy issues in the Department of Commerce) Even the lobbying firm National Group hired him partially because of his very strong last name, and the Navy granted him both age and drug/alcohol waivers when he decided to join up in 2014 out of what the New Yorker claims was a desire to contribute more to society  But surely anyone can relate to Hunter s military service, failing a drug test on his first day in the Navy after a mysterious South African man handed him a cigarette outside a Washington DC bar, which oops! must have contained crack, because he s not sure how else he would have come up positive for cocaine He honorably took a dishonorable discharge, the New Yorker reports, lest the details of his case be leaked to the press and damage dad s political career which he used for relentless warmongering in Iraq, Syria, and Libya The effort to paint Joe Biden an establishment creature who assured his wealthy donors that nothing would fundamentally change if he wins the 2020 election, an ironic promise from someone who served as VP under Mr Hope and Change himself, Barack Obama as a regular guy is transparently inauthentic While voters of Biden s age may have children with drug and alcohol problems too, given that more Americans than ever before are dying of drug overdoses and alcoholism, it s unlikely their kids would have dodged jail if they d returned a rental car complete with crack pipe, a line of a white powdery substance on the armrest, and a wallet full of drivers licenses and credit cards in their name Nor would the voters Biden must convert in order to win the election be able to afford Hunter s multiple rehab stays as the New Yorker reveals, the rental car incident happened after he was distracted from a trip to rehab by a week long crack binge during which he was held at gunpoint at least once Millennials among whom Biden the elder is decidedly unpopular are just as unlikely to see themselves in Hunter, no matter how hard the New Yorker tries to push the line that this child of privilege was not always at ease as the son of the Vice President, uncomfortable with Secret Service agents following him around On occasion, transactions on his credit cards were declined, the New Yorker strains, desperate to paint Hunter as a regular guy who receives 2 8 carat diamonds from Chinese energy tycoons When said tycoon was arrested by Chinese authorities in an anti corruption probe, Hunter defended him as not a shady character at all and merely the victim of bad luck  And Hunter even stepped down from Burisma, the Ukrainian company, after Trump insiders, conservative media and the New York Times began sniffing around, all the while insisting he d done nothing wrong but that the controversy had become a distraction  With Biden s negatives his unhealthy affection for the smell of people s hair, his touchy feely approach to women, his chummy relationships with pro segregation senators and opposition to busing, and his proud allegiance to Wall Street and big business through the roof, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the mainstream media to position him as the Democratic frontrunner Hunter s story could be seen as a hail Mary attempt to convince Americans his father is worthy of their vote, a relatable guy whose son has a drug problem, just like any of them Drug addicts are one of the last minority groups that don t yet have an advocacy organization to promote their interests in Washington, and if Biden can t secure the nomination despite the best efforts of the mainstream media, perhaps he and his son can lead the Junkies Civil Rights Movement Helen Buyniski Think your friends would be interested?

"20 Jun, 2019",Joe Biden is Trumpâs biggest asset in 2020,"The official launch of Trump s campaign for re election in 2020 invites us to ponder if the Democrats are, as in 2016, going to help him win By seeking and blundering we learn,  the renowned German thinker Johann Wolfgang von Goethe asserts is the recipe for progress It s just a pity he isn t around now to advise the Democratic Party on how to beat Trump, because in its case the blundering hasn t stopped and the learning hasn t begun Putting it another way, if, as supporters of Bernie Sandersallege, the DNC (Democratic National Committee, official governing body of the Democratic Party) is intent on repeating its blunder of 2016, when it rigged its nomination process in favour of Hillary Clinton s campaign, Trump s re election is guaranteed This time round, not Hillary Clinton but Joe Biden is the DNC s preferred choice And just like Clinton before him, Biden is a product of a liberal establishment yet to wake up to the fact that the thin gruel of political centrism belongs in the trashcan of history along with its economic twin, neoliberalism Honest Joe is the latest in a long line of out of touch Democrats who believe that shadow rather than substance is the way to the hearts of the American voting public However, having been fooled once by an all singing and all dancing Barack Obama, who didn t so much campaign in poetry and govern in prose, as campaign in poetry and govern in graffiti, the same voting public is yearning for a semblance of substance Joe Biden, as Obama did and as Clinton tried, claims to be on the side of the common man Example: We re going to build an economy that doesn t just reward wealth; we re going to build an economy that rewards work We re going to build an economy that works for everyone  This would be the same man who just this past week went straight fromappearingat a Poor People s Campaign forum in Washington to a Wall Street fundraising event in New York In attendance was a clutch of billionaires whom Biden showered in praise You guys are great,  he told them, presumably while still wiping away the stench of the poor people he just got done promising bread and roses to back in Washington Biden s refusal to confront the inextricable link between Wall Street billionaires and the plight of the poor in America, and his effort to conceal this crucial link with platitudinous guff of a type well known, is the acme of liberal ideology It is precisely why Trump beat Clinton in 2016 and why he will beat Biden in 2020 When you have 40 million people living inpovertyin the richest country in the world, and a working class that has never had it so bad under the asphyxiating pressure of neoliberalism, America needs a president who will tax rather than court billionaires And when you have a world struggling to breath under the weight of US hegemony and unipolarity, responsible for creating the most dangerous period since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, America and the world needs a president who will govern in the interests of peace and stability, not conflict and chaos Joe Biden s record shows that he offers nothing but old wine in a new bottle At a time when radical transformation is needed in the land of the free, putting him in the White House would be like placing a sticking plaster on the gangrenous wound of a society bursting at the seams with economic and social dislocation Trump, who in his customary style refers to Biden as Sleepy Joe , will plough the same furrow of base and crude rhetoric during his 2020 campaign that he did in 2016 It is meat to his base, after all, predominantly made up of white working class men and women for whom Make America Great Again (MAGA) really means make white people great again The elephant in the room in 2020 will again be neoliberalism, an extreme variant of free market capitalism that makes social cohesion an impossible dream and societal breakdown an unavoidable reality No amount of platitudes, offered up to the God of political failure, can elide this fact either And no candidate who isn t willing to slay this particular elephant can credibly claim to stand for an escape from a grim past and present in pursuit of a better future That America is a nation and empire in decline is not in doubt Pulitzer Prize winning author and journalist Chris Hedges eloquently explores and charts this decline in his 2010 article Do Not Pity the Democrats The menace we face does not come from the insane wing of the Republican Party but from the institutions tasked with protecting democratic participation Do not fear Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin Do not fear the Tea Party movement, the birthers,  the legions of conspiracy theorists, or the militias Fear the underlying corporate power structure, which no one, from Barack Obama to the right wing nut cases who pollute the airwaves, can alter If the hegemony of the corporate state is not soon broken, we will descend into a technologically enhanced age of barbarism  A grim depiction of the future in 2010, I m sure you ll agree, but one that in 2019 cannot be gainsaid The battle raging between America and corporate America is a battle for the future But it s a strange fight this fight, in that up to now only one side, corporate America, knows who the enemy is and what it s fighting for The other America, meanwhile, continues to exist in a fog of false consciousness, cultivated and sustained by a mainstream media that peddles happy talk instead of serious analysis The soldiers fighting for corporate America are, with rare exception, the Republicans and Democrats in Washington And in a 2020 race involving Trump and Biden, each will go out of his way to claim fealty to the primary victims of corporate America the American people when the opposite is the case It was Charles De Gaulle who once said, In order to be the master, the politician poses as the servant   In the case of a US presidential election, his words should be amended to read: In order serve corporate America, the politician poses as the servant of the people  Joe Biden cannot win against Trump simply because Trump, unlike him, is America with its mask of civility removed And the liberation experienced by the removal of the mask is more attractive than the prospect of it having to put it back on again The choice the American people need in 2020 is not a window or an aisle seat on a flight to the same destination What they need is a different flight to a whole new destination That destination is social and economic justice at home and multipolarity abroad Think your friends would be interested?

"17 May, 2019",No to Christchurch Call: Put aside your hate of Trump for a day â he may have just saved free speech,"Even adversaries of the US president should admit that he is the only one who has stood up to the disturbing anti free speech proposal concocted by illiberal globalist world leaders and compliant tech companies Ironically, by becoming the sole leader of a major Western power to reject the Christchurch Call the cross border plan to restrict terrorist and extremist content online Donald Trump has consolidated support for the document, sparing it deserved scrutiny After all, who doesn t want to stop violence being spread through social media, particularly in the wake of the double mosque shooting in New Zealand in March? Well judging by the commentary in mainstream media outlets only that exceptionalist US president, and that band of white supremacists on whom he is relying to win in 2020 But I would urge those of all political persuasions to study thetextof the document, presented by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week, and endorsed by every major US online giant Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter Are these really the powers you want to give away to officials and Silicon Valley execs? Or should we at least ask some clarifying questions first? Here are some notable and representative excerpts: We, the governments commit to counter the drivers of terrorism and violent extremism by strengthening the resilience and inclusiveness of our societies to enable them to resist terrorist and violent extremist ideologies, including through education, building media literacy to help counter distorted terrorist and violent extremist narratives, and the fight against inequality This is the first bullet point, and we are already onto loaded political terminology rife with assumptions Why must societies become more inclusive  a byword for multiculturalism to stop terrorism? Why is the fight against inequality  a predominantly leftist agenda a pre condition for preventing it? Osama bin Laden wasn t a pauper, and neither was gym trainer Brenton Tarrant for that matter More important are the treacherously vague definitions that almost invite abuse Who decides what is a distorted narrative ? How do you build media literacy  is it, as always, by using NewsGuard to tell people not to click on R tdotco m instead of the New York Times? What is even violent extremist ideology ? Support for mass murder in mosques is But what about those who want mosques shut down because they believe Islam is a scourge on Western society? Or those who ride out in militias to protect the US Mexican border from illegal migrants? Are they advocating a violent extremist ideology ? How about Black Lives Matter they often engage in violence, and demand radical social change? Antifa? The Venezuelan opposition, who plan to overthrow their elected president and want the army to defect? Support frameworks, such as industry standards, to ensure that reporting on terrorist attacks does not amplify terrorist and violent extremist content, without prejudice to responsible coverage of terrorism and violent extremism I vewrittenat length about the fallout from the New Zealand only censorship of Tarrant s trial, but the core point here is: why should governments tell the free media through these nebulous industry standards  how to cover what politicians say is extremist content ? Or anything at all What is amplify ? Where does the line lie between not amplifying and hushing up? What is responsible coverage ? Accelerate research into and development of technical solutions to prevent the upload of and to detect and immediately remove terrorist and violent extremist content online, and share these solutions through open channels, drawing on expertise from academia, researchers, and civil society So rather than a post moderation internet, the document wants us to move to pre moderation if Facebook doesn t like your video you simply will never ever be able to put it online, and considering that the networks plan to share all data, this should automatically apply to all the others You will be shouting silently into the void One is not sure that the fact algorithms are currently so imperfect is a good or a bad thing Using algorithms and other processes to redirect users from [extremist] content or the promotion of credible, positive alternatives or counter narratives So you click, for example, for an Alex Jones link, or even a Paul Joseph Watson one both already dangerous personae non grata on most of the signatories websites and instead it takes you to a credible, positive alternative approved by Macron or Angela Merkel or Justin Trudeau? Or perhaps, even more neatly when you search for these names or RT, for example none of their content will come up Deprioritized and delisted content can never corrupt you I do not believe that the politicians and entrepreneurs gathered in France on Wednesday are in a conspiracy to shut down free speech or neuter their political opposition Most of them surely believe that they are merely safeguarding the internet from to note another loaded term bad actors  But they are not political neutrals either The Christchurch Call did not come after any of the dozens of Muslim bombings that happened in the West, or at the peak of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) propaganda efforts, when polished beheading videos made it online every week and were shared by millions, and freely amplified by the media The unequivocal far right atrocity serves merely as a cynical hook for countering years of mainstream party anxiety about losing control of the narrative online, which turned into an ongoing breakdown with Hillary Clinton s loss in 2016 While reactive, the Christchurch Call isn t some brainstorm knocked up in eight weeks This is the establishment s unifying achievement a non binding agreement that will nonetheless serve as a blueprint for future international regulation If adopted, for most living in the West, there would be no escape It is very possible that these new tools will be used cautiously filtering out only the guns and splatter But with definitions of hate speech and what is considered extremist being systematically broadened, over time years? months? there will be appeals to use these technologies to suppress more and more voices And judging by the previous record of the social networks involved, the losers will be the Islamophobes and the transphobes and the Russian trolls  real or imagined and not the radical feminists calling for all men to be castrated, nor Antifa protesters in balaclavas filming themselves disrupting a campus speech While the document talks about the need for transparency and an efficient complaints and appeals process for any censorship, it leaves both the decisions and the implementation to the tech companies themselves Enforcing community standards or terms of service will still be king so if a Twitter mod wants to close your account it will be his call and enshrined right This is also bound to have a chilling effect on contributors who know that one over the line video will exile them from all the biggest internet forums, and deprive them of their income streams Less clear is whether pushing the marginalized into the darker corners of the internet actually helps to prevent the flourishing of extremism, or will create a parallel underground network that will be far more radicalized Imagine a bigger and more toxic 4chan for all the rejects, if you can What is certain is that any filtering, reporting and pre moderation technologies developed as a result of the Christchurch Call will be adopted with enthusiasm by genuinely repressive regimes, and likely deployed by the California giants themselves at the request of such governments, who will cite their own anti extremism legislation By abstaining from the document, the US now has a chance not only of protecting its own population, but of sabotaging the entire Christchurch Call project All the companies involved are still operating primarily under US jurisdiction, so they will be shielded from these initiatives Indeed, if they decide to impose these measures over the will of American citizens, they leave themselves open to First Amendment based government regulation, and what may eventually become costly lawsuits So, there remains one opportunity here to drop the partisan politics, and rally behind the White House decision for the sake of free speech if you believe in it By not making it a Donald Trump versus the World issue, there is a chance to help not only Americans, but the cause of freedom around the globe By Igor Ogorodnev Igor Ogorodnev is a Russian British journalist, who has worked at RT since 2007 as a correspondent, editor and writer Like this story?

"27 Feb, 2019","As voice after voice gets purged from social media, still think thereâs no censorship?","For a civilization that considers freedom of speech one of its fundamental principles and universal human rights, the West sure does a lot of censorship and no, farming it out to private companies does not change what it is It happened again on Tuesday: British activist Tommy Robinson waserasedfrom Facebook and Instagram The social media behemothsaidit has to act when ideas and opinions cross the line and amount to hate speech that may create an environment of intimidation and exclusion for certain groups in society  As online polemicists are fond of saying, citation needed! Yet Facebook offers none: no evidence of specific violations, not even a definition of hate speech, just an arbitrary standard and a threat of further bans for people who support hate figures Whatever that means This is the part that is terrifying Facebook has deemed Tommy Robinson a hate figure  and says that praise or support for these figures  is banned So if I criticize Facebook s ban of Tommy Robinson, am I supporting  a hate figure? pic twitter com/2S1sB8faaC How did journalists those paladins of free speech, the fabled Fourth Estate, the valiant protectors of values that would die in darkness without their intrepid efforts greet this news? Did they object to a British citizen being muzzled and wax about the dangers to digital democracy? Oh no, theyrejoiced: Finally, what took so long?! The same process repeated itself later in the day, when Twitter banned Jacob Wohl The self described supporter of US President Donald Trump had reportedly boasted about setting up fake accounts to influence the 2020 election That is regarded as the sin above all sins by social media executives, terrified of Congress blaming them for Hillary Clinton losing the White House to Trump in 2016, even though 99 percent of US media considered it rightfully hers Here s the thing, though: Twitter still hasn t banned Jonathon Morgan, CEO of New Knowledge, a company that was proven to have set upthousands of fake accountsto swing the Senate race in Alabama to the Democrats, and later paid by the Senateto blame Russiafor its tactics So Twitter can suspend Jacob Wohl for allegedly creating multiple accounts but didn t ban Dem cyber disinformation protection firm CEO@jonathonmorganthat created hundreds of Russian bot accounts to manipulate a federal election under fraudulent pretenses So suprising ðpic twitter com/t5CR0olZ2Q Let s also remember the suspension of several Facebook pages belonging toMaffick Media, an outfit that partners with Ruptly, a RT subsidiary After the Twitter police at the German Marshall Fund and CNNraised a fussabout these pages having Kremlin ties, Facebook blocked them until they agreed to put up a notice about being funded by Russia So they did, even though there is no such rule that would be universally applied Surely it is entirely a coincidence that a CNN reporter went around actively badgering social media outlets toban Alex Jones, way back in August 2018, and would not stop until they all did? YouTube Terminates Don Shipley s YouTube Channel That Exposed Nathan Phillips Stolen Valor One Angry Gamerhttps:// tdotco /H7CyE0uIsO But wait, there is more! It was confirmed on Tuesday that retired Navy SEAL Don Shipley, known as a crusader against stolen valor,  got his YouTube channel deleted earlier this month There were no details as to why, but this was right after Shipley had exposed Nathan Phillips the Native American activist who claimed he was victimized by Kentucky high school students, in what turned out to befake news as falsely claiming he served in Vietnam Columbia University researcher Richard Hanania offeredan interesting analysisa couple of weeks ago, showing that of the 22 prominent figures suspended by Twitter in recent years, 21 were supporters of President Donald Trump, and only one Rose McGowan was a Democrat McGowan had clearly violated the platform s rule against doxxing, and was reinstated after she deleted the post Many of those 21 Trump supporters were not so lucky, getting permanent bans from the platform So he asked: Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary? What are the odds? Astronomical, actually Hanania showed that conservatives would have to be four times as likely to violate Twitter rules for even a 5 percent chance of producing the 21 1 ratio Yet those who routinely cite statistical disparate impact to cry racism are perfectly fine claiming there is no bias here? Really? But [insert social media giant here] is a private company! They can do what they want! So cry the sudden champions of capitalism and deregulation, who in their previous breath claimed Trumpabolishing Net Neutralityrules would break the internet Make up your mind, folks! In the McCarthyite atmosphere whipped up after the 2016 US presidential election, the social media that once promised unprecedented freedom of expression have turned into the tools of censorship and not on behalf of a governing party, either, but the bipartisan political establishment united in opposition to an outsider president and anyone who dares support him, or criticize their conduct By the way, the terrible dictator Trump hasn t lifted a finger to stop this persecution, let alonesic the IRSor the FBI on his critics Alex Jones was the test case to see if America would accept censoring free speech We did Roger Stone was the test case to see if America would accept government raids at gun point for political hit squads to take us to jail We did What is the next test?

The idea behind free speech is not that all opinions are valid, but that they ought to be debated rather than imposed by force Another fundamental principle of western civilization is that the law ought to apply equally to everyone One does not have to agree with Robinson, Wohl, Shipley, Maffick, Jones or Trump, for that matter to realize that a world in which there is one set of rules for us and another for them, in which it doesn t matter what is done but Who is doing it to Whom, is not a land of liberty but something quite different Nebojsa Malic The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/452511-social-media-censorship-bans/
"7 Nov, 2018",Midterm madness shows US media more divisive than the American people,"As witnessed by the midterm elections, the US is cracking up along political and cultural lines The mainstream media must accept a large part of the blame for this dangerous period of partisanship that only promises to worsen Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Ever since Donald Trump crashed the White House, the US media has dropped all pretensions of being a fair and impartial observer of the political scene The gloves of objectiveness have come off and journalists now compete in the political ring as full combatants, as opposed to neutral ringside announcers reporting the action as it happens That much was proven on Monday, the day before midterms, when popular Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro appeared on stage with Trump at a political rally in the blood red state of Missouri This stunt unleashed the predictable howls of protest from sea to shining sea By taking part in the rally, Mr Hannity was crossing the line that had traditionally separated those in the news media from the people they are supposed to cover, The New York Timeswailed Fox News entered new territory  a thicket in which it s hard to tell where the network ends and the president begins  Sean Hannity says Democrats winning House is meaninglesshttps:// tdotco /P3Da72welI#ElectionNightpic twitter com/Qz3BRS4H8x Although it was surreal to see Hannity at a rally stumping for the Republicans (a move that Fox News said it did not condone,callingit an unfortunate distraction )it was not surprising given the guerrilla style reporting that passes for journalism these days Media partisanship has delivered a broadside to the US political system, and the fact that there are media trenches in the first place explains everything we need to know Even before Trump got elected, the mainstream media was priming its audiences to disavow the maverick from Manhattan Did this have anything to with his promise to drain the swamp known as Washington, DC? It is a very tantalizing explanation Whatever the case may be, the left leaning media organized and published stunninglyflawedmedia polls predicting a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election As we now know, just the opposite transpired as Trump sailed to easy victory The half deranged disappointment felt by the Democrats was intensified by the unsubstantiated claim that Russia not the American voter was responsible for putting Trump into the Oval Office Jim Acosta is a joke and CNN should be ashamed of themselves pic twitter com/IphIU7PvCO That fantastic media story, which can best be described as the conspiracy theory of the century (admittedly, the century is young), snowballed into an FBI investigation known as Russiagate Entering its second year, this media inflamed show trial starring a colorful cast ofporn starsandUkraine linked businessmen has failed to produce a shred of evidence pointing to collaboration between Trump and the Kremlin Yet the Mueller show grinds on, driving a wedge between Americans, while bringing relations with Russia to the boiling point And lest we forget, while peddling the Russia meddling smokescreen, the media was able to ignore the explosive claim that Hillary Clinton used her personal computer to send and receive top secret government emails, which was the real story all along What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president s request This was NOT planned At this point, battle lines between the Trump administration and the mainstream media were drawn in the sand The Republican leader, assaulted on a daily basis by every tentacle of America ssix headed mediamonster, understandably began denigrating it as fake news This led to some veryintensepress conferences, especially with CNN, which many on the right have come tocallthe Clinton News Network Although I admit the 45th president of the United States may have some character flaws, I fail to understand why the media has declared a permanent open season on this man After all, like it or not, Trump won the election fair and square And let s give credit where credit is deserved: there are no wars (yet) on the horizon, while the economy, stupid, is roaring Nevertheless, fair, balanced and objective news reporting has been jettisoned in favor of fantasy This radical flight from fancy is at least partially responsible not only for the political psychosis that has attacked the nation s frontal lobe, but for  leading the country to the very doorstep of civil war In the not so distant past, the media could be counted upon to tame the more impulsive reactions of the electorate, blunting controversy with reasoned argument and substantiated reporting Today, by comparison, it is the media that is responsible for inflaming the passions of the dual constituencies An ideal solution to this media mayhem, where the Republicans and Democrats both enjoy their own private propaganda services is to let journalists from Fox News and CNN labor together inside of the same four walls I only slightly jest But think about it Such a move would help encourage what is so missing today in the torched media landscape: the eradication of barriers and meeting the enemy for face to face debate Today, the media seems to be arguing for argument s sake, not for the sake of promoting the public good CNN s election experts don t even know where Indiana and Kentucky are located on a map pic twitter com/vXqTdHvU5x The bifurcation of the mainstream media into two hostile camps exactly mirrors what is happening in society at large This is no coincidence Voters from both sides of the political aisle (the fact that there are only two political sides to choose from also greatly complicates the situation) have barricaded themselves inside of an electric moat known as social media , which is in reality anything but social Each side hunkers down behind their Facebook and Twitter accounts, lobbing the occasional verbal grenade from inside their heavily defended echo chambers The media is equally guilty of such behavior with all of the disastrous consequences we are experiencing today In such a sheltered and bitter world, there is no chance for honest conversation among the people nor the media Political debate has been reduced to short and snarky 280 character ripostes, while the walls between the two camps continue to grow higher Those inside the media world, where subjective passions must take a backseat to objective reporting, should have resisted the temptation to take sides in the political debate Instead, they now finds themselves serving as mere pawns on one or the other side of the great game The public can see through the ridiculous charade, which only damages the credibility of the mainstream legacy media This dangerous new development, where the media and the people are split into parallel universes or alternative realities, each clinging to their own false narratives, can only end in disaster for America s great experiment in democracy @Robert_Bridge Think your friends

"6 Aug, 2018",Chilling precedent? InfoWars block exposes Big Tech as no friend of free speech,"The US Constitution explicitly forbids government censorship So Silicon Valley big tech companies made themselves the gatekeepers of goodthink, de platforming anyone who runs afoul of their arbitrary community standards Alex Jones, the host of InfoWars, has often been derided by establishment media as a conspiracy theorist Yet on Monday, Apple, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook proved right the motto of his show There s a war on for your mind!  byblocking or deletingInfoWars accounts from their platforms, saying he allegedly engaged in hate speech and violated their community standards  Simply put, these corporations appointed themselves arbiters of acceptable political thought, and censored Jones for failing to comply with arbitrary political standards set in Silicon Valley boardrooms, not at the ballot box Whether you like@RealAlexJonesand Infowars or not, he is undeniably the victim today of collusion by the big tech giants What price free speech?https:// tdotco /DWroGYaWvk The First Amendment to the US Constitution says that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press There is no hate speech exemption, either In fact, hate speech is not even a legal category in the US However, a chorus of voices all too glad Jones was purged immediately chimed up to argue that Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Spotify are private companies and this does not apply to them There is a wrinkle in that argument, though: civil rights outfits such as the ACLU have argued that social media amount to a designated public forum in cases where government officials tried to avail themselves of blocking, muting and other functions put forth by Big Tech as a way to police toxicity on their platforms When the government designates social media a public forum, the First Amendment prohibits it from limiting the discourse based on viewpoint, the ACLU said in a briefsubmitted last yearin a case before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia When a government actor bans critics from speaking in a forum, it silences and chills dissent, warps the public conversation, and skews public perception, the ACLU brief went on In a separate but obviously related case,a federal judgeused the designated public forum definition to demand that President Donald Trump allow critics access to his personal Twitter account not the official @POTUS one because he is a public official However, if social media platforms are a designated public forum that government is not allowed to exclude people from on First Amendment grounds, how is it OK for corporations that operate these platforms to do so?

"16 Jul, 2018",Breaking a downward spiral: Trump-Putin meeting a breakthrough regardless of practical outcome,"The US and Russian leaders will meet in an atmosphere of open animosity towards Russia in the West In this context, the very fact of the meeting, which part of the US establishment sought to derail, could be deemed a success A summit between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is a much anticipated event and it is also long overdue As unhinged Russophobia increasingly grips the West and relations between two of the world s major powers hit a historic low since the Cold War, a meeting between the two leaders might at least slow down the continued slide towards even greater confrontation if not really improve the troubled relations between Moscow and Washington Putin puts Russia s interests first & respects Trump s reciprocal beliefs Kremlin spokesmanhttps:// tdotco /bPMEJVzZ22 The extraordinary circumstances surrounding this meeting make it a sort of victory of proponents of common sense over those who seek to push their own narrow interests at the expense of international relations and, eventually, global security During his election campaign in 2016 and after his inauguration, Trumpsaidrepeatedly that he would like to have better relations with Russia, which had already soured on the last leg of Barack Obama s second presidential term over Syria and Ukraine His position that having good ties with Russia is better for the US brought on him the additional ire of the liberal resistance and the establishment amid the Mueller probe into alleged election meddling and collusion that hasn t produced much evidence, but generated high costs and daily debates Trump s presidency has seen further deterioration of relations between Moscow and Washington When a diplomatic row began under the Obama administration and saw diplomats expelled, Russia chose not to retaliate, waiting for Trump s actions Under his administration, however, sanctions have been slapped on Moscow, diplomats have been expelled, and Russian diplomatic compounds have been searched MoscowcondemnedWashington s moves at that time, calling it the behavior of raiders and accusing the US of violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations The US ignored Russia s objections and once againbrokeinto a Russian diplomatic compound This followed more expulsions in response to London s baseless accusation that Moscow poisoned the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK This time, the US also went so far as to boot out Russian diplomats working at the UN headquarters in New York, in what Moscowcalleda violation of international agreements Coupled with unfettered Russophobia following the worst patterns of McCarthyism that swayed the minds of a significant part of the US establishment and the media community, this policy brought relations between the two countries to within a hair s breadth of a red line separating political animosity from open conflict The USnamedRussia among the major threats in its Nuclear Posture Review, and it sought ways to bypass one of the cornerstones of the international disarmamentregime the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty all in the name of countering perceived aggressive strategies by Russia It has therefore become clear that the US officials preoccupied with anti Russian conspiracies, which they themselves contrived, have lost touch with reality and are ready to put the world on the brink of a new arms race, if not a new global war, in a bid to protect Washington s dominance in the world Even at the beginning of his presidency, Trump admitted that US Russian relations had hit a historic low Since that time, the situation has seemingly become much worse With US Russian relations reduced to sporadic meetings between diplomats and military, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently put it, a meeting that could overcome this confrontational narrative of bilateral relations by the mere fact of it taking place would have extreme significance Even though the meeting apparently already has enough symbolic meaning to make holding it a worthy goal, both sides also have certain expectations of the event Quite reasonably, Moscow sees the summit primarily as a way to just restore dialog between the two nations and add some common sense in bilateral relations If Trump and Putin manage to re open all the channels [of dialog] on both divisive issues and those issues where we can usefully cooperate, such an outcome of the meeting could be called ideal, LavrovtoldLarry King in a recent interview The US and NATO, which together spend 12 times more money on defense than Russia, has yet to understand that it cannot dictate to each and every country how to handle international security matters, the minister said, adding that dialogue is required His words were partly echoed by the Russian president s aide, Yury Ushakov, whosaidthat the Kremlin sees the goal of the meeting as changing the negative situation in relations between the US and Russia, as well as bringing mutual trust to some acceptable level However, Moscow is apparently also reluctant to set its hopes high as Ushakov said that the Russian side does not expect the two leaders to even issue a joint statement following the summit Such a stance perfectly fits into Moscow s general approach that involvesreadinessto build bridges with the US, which it prefers to see as a partner despite its regrettable security strategy The US expectations for the summit, meanwhile, look much vaguer as Washington seemingly still cannot define its own attitude to its negotiating partner Over the days preceding the summit, Trump has alreadycalledPutin a competitor andsaidthat the US was tougher on Russia than anybody At the same time, he also repeatedly stated that if we could develop a relationship, it would be good for Russia and good for us, good for everybody On Sunday, the US president told CBS that he is going into the meeting with low expectations He added that nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out of it According to the US ambassador to Russia, Trump would like tomeetPutin one on one to actually understand if Russia wants good relations with the US The US president himself, meanwhile, admitted that he still cannot say if Moscow is Washington s friend or foe Notably, neither Moscow nor Washington spoke about any concrete agreements that could be reached as a result of the talks, which makes one presume that, in a practical sense, the results of the summit would hardly be significant The main purpose of the meeting is to highlight the need to restore direct lines of communication at many levels between the US and Russian governments and civil society that were severed by the Obama administration following the Crimea referendum, Gilbert Doctorow, political analyst and author, told RT There is a great deal to be accomplished in restoring normal, civilized relations between the two countries first, he added Meanwhile, Jim Jatras, a Washington DC based attorney, political analyst, and media and government affairs specialist, believes that the meeting will not result in a practical agreement not only because of the sorry state of US Russian relations but also because while Putin is master in his house, Trump is not in his There is virtually no instruction Trump can give to the Washington apparatus of power he can be confident will be carried out, Jatras told RT, noting that the establishment and media tried to prevent his election, then tried to neutralize him after he won, and is still trying to find a means to remove him, my any means possible The US establishment as well as at least some of Washington s Western allies have, meanwhile, spared no effort to prevent or at least spoil the forthcoming summit The US media are almost competing toprovidetheir audiences with most bizarre conspiracy theories about possible collusion between Trump and Putin as a renewed push to promote the narrative that has become increasingly threadbare over the last couple of years In one of the most vivid examples of such dizzying feats, New York magazineclaimedthat the US leader was actually a Russian spy since at least 1987 The US neocons were also not too far behind the media as theysuggestedthat US National Security Advisor John Bolton, who is actually known as an arch hawk and war cheerleader, might well be Putin s stooge just because he traveled to Moscow to discuss the details of the meeting between the two leaders The crux of the matter was the US Justice Department s announcement that 12 people identified as Russian intelligence officers had beenindictedfor hacking the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign The news conveniently came just days ahead of the meeting, prompting Moscow tosaythat the move was aimed at spoiling the upcoming summit in the Finnish capital of Helsinki Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the British establishment and journalists launched their own verbal assault on the Kremlin following yet another chemical incident on the British soil, even though the UK has so far provided no evidence linking even the March poisoning of Skripals to Moscow, not to mention the new incident, which was predictably immediatelyblamedon Russia without any proof being presented For the establishment, US Russia enmity isn t a means to an end it is the end, Jatras said, commenting on the issue He told RT that Washington effectively sees Russia as an obstacle to continued US global hegemony and the huge flows of money spread around, both at home and abroad, [used] to sustain it Anything less than endless hostility is a direct threat to the financial wellbeing and ideological core of a vast army of mandarins, he added Like this story?

"11 Apr, 2018","Wheels of war are already in motion: Mainstream media should try to stop it, but will it?","I knew this was deadly serious when I saw Tony Blair being wheeled around on British television to help explain to the public why we have to act Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site  21st Century Wire He also hosts the  SUNDAY WIRE  weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site  21st Century Wire He also hosts the  SUNDAY WIRE  weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK Here we are again, hearing the incessant calls for another direct military action led by the United States, and all in the name of weapons of mass destruction Whichever way this goes, it may very well be the final act in the West s long running chemical saga After the hard lessons of Iraq, you might be asking how this is happening again It s not a surprise that the US and UK might lie, exaggerate, distort or invent a narrative as a pretext for military action However, they couldn t pull it off without their media partners, and history clearly demonstrates that when the governments and media collude, the results are catastrophic More than any other entity, it is the Western mainstream media who have facilitated this dirty war on Syria, and who are still holding the minds of the West s public hostage The reasonable among us would hope that cooler heads will prevail The OPCWannouncedthat it will dispatch a team of experts at the invitation of Syrian Arab Republic to investigate the incident This is promising The real question now is: Will chemical weapons inspectors arrive in Damascus before Trump s cruise missiles? President Trump promised a forceful response against Syria, with partners like Great Britain and France seemingly ready to join in at a moment s notice Russia hasrespondedwith a reciprocal warning that any US missiles targeting Syria will be intercepted and that their launch pads will be targeted Russia certainly does not want to see a worldwide war, but it is nonetheless committed to defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Syrian territory Undoubtedly, this is the closest the US and Russia have come to a hot war since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 Western governments, media outlets, their rebel and NGO proxies, are allclaimingthat the Syrian government has dropped a barrel bomb containing lethal chemicals, possibly chlorine gas, in the district of Douma near Eastern Ghouta this past Saturday, killing at least 40 people and injuring up to 1,000 others The source of this report is the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) and the White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, who are funded by the UK and US governments Both of these organizations work exclusively in terrorist held areas around Syria Western war hawks are all claiming that Assad has form and therefore must be guilty The Syrian authorities have denied that government forces launched any such assault, while the Russian Foreign Ministry has described the event as invented and fabricated Washington has wasted no time, having already compiled its dossier of internet photos, social media videos, witness testimonies, and satellite images of Syrian flights and helicopters in the area The obvious questions to anyone familiar with this conflict should be: Why would the Syrian government invite international condemnation and risk an all out war by launching a chemical weapons attack against the very citizens its army has been fighting and dying for, to try to liberate from terrorist occupation? Why would they snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? Such common sense inquiries seem lost on the Western government media complex If you are serious about finding out what really happened in Douma, you need to know which parties are in control of facts on the ground On one hand, you have the Syrian government, the Syrian Arab Army, the Russian military One the other side, you have a group that was still in control of some of this area over the weekend, Jaysh al Islam (Army of Islam), who are the ideological companions of ISIS, and who the Western mediastill refer toas a Syrian rebel group Everything in their area operates under their authority, including the Western backed SAMS and the White Helmets Government interests aside, we might ask how the West has arrived in a place where it is staking its position alongside a non state actor and terrorist group, Jaysh al Islam, over its fellow UN members? For years now, Western media and politicians have been trying to prop up the viability of various rebel groups, as well lending them a semblance of political credibility by claiming they are in opposition to the Assad regime In fact, up until only a few weeks ago, Jaysh al Islam was the dominant militant group in control of East Ghouta and Douma Since 2012, this terrorist group and its affiliates have killed or captured thousands of civilian religious minorities, along with government workers and soldiers One of their worst atrocities commenced on December 11, 2013, when thousands of militants from Jaysh al Islam, Al Nusra and others invaded the key workers town of Adra, located in the Rif Dimashq Governorate, northeast of Damascus The terrorists fully backed by the United States and its allies at this time overran Syrian police and army positions beforemassacringthe town s residents, executing people in their homes, beheading others in the street, with bodies reportedly left in the open, and the heads of victims reportedly displayed on trees and poles Some residents are reported to have been cooked alive in the town s industrial baking ovens On balance, the atrocities and crimes against humanity perpetrated by Jaysh al Islam are as horrific as those of ISIS, who the US claims to be its sworn enemy in Syria The hypocrisy is almost mind bending While reporting in Syria last spring, I remember driving past Adra, and now a dead town Locals spoke of this event in subdued tones and with empty expressions The tragedy remains a scar on the national consciousness, but one which has been completely airbrushed from Western view for the simple reason that it would incriminate and defame the reprobate moderate rebels who were being championed at the time by Western politicians like Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, US Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, Congressmen Ed Royce and Adam Kinzinger, British MP Brooks Newmark and many others To the political architects of the Syrian war, the rebels in Syria served exactly the same function as Reagan and Oliver North s freedom fighter Contras in Nicaragua Their role was to foment violence and sectarian division while destabilizing the state structures in that country, softening it up for an eventual regime change Like the Contras, the US government allegedlytraffickedover $1 5 billion in illicit weapons to their rebels in Syria and like the Iranian Contra scandal, much of the billwas paid bya third party, in this case Saudi Arabia After subduing its competition in East Ghouta and Douma, Jaysh al Islam then proceeded to hold religious minorities incagesand parade them around the streets through their new suburban caliphate, before torturing and beheading some of them Those who were allowed to live were then used for various forms of slave labor, including helping to dig an impressive network oftunnelsunderneath Ghouta, Jobar and other terrorist held areas These are not Vietcong style four by four foot shafts, but concrete reinforced tunnels large enough to drive a truck through While this underground operation has been well documented in the Syrian, Russian and independent press, it s been more or less blacked out by the Western mainstream media Why? Maybe because the Western PR machine is wary of allowing their public to understand the insidious nature and substantial backing which these so called rebels have enjoyed courtesy of the US, UK, France, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and most notably Saudi Arabia and Qatar massive foreign support which has undoubtedly extended this long war In other words, it s the US led coalition that is ultimately responsible for prolonging this bloody war, not Bashar Assad It s important to understand that Western governments and media are not merely reacting to some atrocity this week, rather they have been geared up for escalating a hot war on Syria since 2011, and even wellbeforethat At every turn, a concerted effort have been made to downplay any reports which run counter to the US led coalition s narrative and to promote any claims or video footage supplied by Western financed media producers like the White Helmets, Aleppo Media Center, and the SOHR (based in the UK), as three prime examples, but there are dozens of other outlets performing the same function This command and control structure of the West s Syrian information network should be obvious by now Instead, all we hear from the mainstream media is a steady chorus of Assad s Barrel Bombs, followed by Assad is butchering his own people, and Assad has killed 400,000 of his own people, and Assad and the Russians are targeting hospitals and schools and killing children Such talking points are often repeated, but never challenged The last seven years has seen one of the most coordinated propaganda campaigns in history and, save for a few brave award winning journalists like Seymour Hersh, John Pilger, Gareth Porter, there s been little self examination in the Western media It s as if there s a party whip line in West where no one dares cross it for fear of being accused of being against the children of Syria, or being branded with derogatory McCarthyist labels like Assadist and Putinist, or the latest iteration, white supremacist Such slurs suit those whose mission it is to silence dissent against what is looking more and more like an official declaration of war by the US and UK against Syria, Russia and Iran When you peel back all the pejoratives and political smears, however, what you are left with are the facts, and they are damning But the problem is that you cannot find many facts in The Guardian, or the Washington Post; only polemics and narratives which are synonymous with the public policy positions of the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office One reason is that these mainstream outlets do not have reporters on the ground in Syria, and if they do, they tend to be embedded with rebel terrorist factions which is the only side of the story which is being transmitted to Western audiences The day after the Rashideen Massacre in April 2017, I was with a group of journalists and international observers at the Jibrin Refugee Center outside of Aleppo, where I sought to speak to some of the survivors of what became Syria s most deadly terrorist car bombing, which killed over 120 innocents, most of them children (with some still missing to this day) I remember seeing a Washington Post journalist there and wondered how the mainstream press might report this awful tragedy My answer came soon enough Leading US mainstream media outlets called it a hiccup, perhaps because they were embarrassed by the depths to which their freedom fighting rebels have sunk this time carrying out a sectarian mass murder of Shia residents from the villages of Foua and Kafarya The systematic anti Syrian bias of Western mainstream media has effectively robbed the people of Syria of any chance of getting a fair adjudication in the court of Western public opinion It s not that they can t report the truth, it s that they won t They can hype up a situation and flood the information sphere with misinformation and distractions, but void of truth Their propaganda fodder has no staying power once the facts begin to trickle in The liberation of East Aleppo is a perfect example, as is the mainstream coverage of East Ghouta both a universe away from reality This brings us back to the Douma chemical attack At every key juncture in this long war, when the Syrian government was making significant advances, or a US official uttered that maybe the US should think about pulling out of Syria all of the sudden and inexplicably a chemical weapons attack manifests itself Journalist Vanessa Beeley so aptly described this uncanny phenomenon in her detailedreportthis week on the ground in Damascus: If we were tomapthe chemical weapon claims in each terrorist held area undergoing liberation by the Syrian Arab Army, we would clearly see that the claims are commensurate with the pressure felt by the terrorist factions as the SAA closes in on their stronghold In other words, as the SAA nears victory and liberation of Syrian civilians, we are expected to believe they would use chemical weapons against those civilians in an urban area which is even more densely packed as the terrorists withdraw into a shrinking combat zone, taking the civilians with them as human shields and hostages Beeley adds: It appears to be a propaganda tactic employed by the terrorist factions to gain time, secure a ceasefire and to call for a No Fly Zone and further humanitarian intervention from the regime change war alliance A ceasefire allows the militants to organize themselves and to re arm We know that terrorist chemical weapon attacks against the civilian population in West Aleppo were never given equivalent importance by the same humanitarian minded nations, in fact they were largely ignored Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that crying chemical weapon is a tactic designed to protect the NATO member state assets occupying Syrian territory The US seems certain about Assad s chemical weapons, but what about the WMD capabilities of the rebel terrorists? Another independent journalist, Sharmine Narwani, was actually in Eastern Ghouta as it was liberated in March, where she discovered one chemical weapons laboratory located in the farmlands between between Shifouniyeh and Douma Narwani also noted how the Western media journalists in her press pool seemed categorically disinterested in this crucial discovery Terrorist capabilities laid bare in an#EasternGhoutachemical lab (Op ed by@snarwani)https://t co/qCVmuVK09y It seems that the US, UK and others have dug such a deep hole with years of deceptive reporting and fictional accounts of Assad s atrocities over the years, that they cannot lose face now After seven years of being marinated in anti Syrian and anti Russian propaganda, there is little chance the Western electorate can be rehabilitated with facts These parallel realities may be irreconcilable With the stakes this high, we can only pray for any divine wisdom coming from Washington or London If it comes, it will be most welcome, but it seems the wheels of war are already in motion Perhaps the only thing standing between a wider war and de escalation is the press They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but can we really expect the media use it against its own corporate overlords?

"2 Mar, 2018",Russiagate as historical amnesia or denialism - Stephen Cohen,"Many aspects of Russiagate are said to be unprecedented which is very far from the truth Stephen F Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US American Cold War (Previous installments, now in their fourth year, are atTheNation com ) Russians pride themselves on an awareness of living history  memories of past events whose recurrence or consequences continue to influence current politics The phenomenon known as Russiagate suggests that many Americans have less such awareness or memories, though this may be partly generational Cohen, who is old enough to be emeritus (retired) at two universities, has vivid memories of past events and practices that are precedents ignored by today s promoters of Russiagate He discusses the following examples: § A fundamental tenet of Russiagate is that the Kremlin sought, primarily through social media but not only, to create or exacerbate divisions in American society and politics Even if true, there is no evidence that this purported campaign had any meaningful impact on how Americans voted in the 2016 presidential elections And even if true, the social and political divisions were hardly comparable to those experienced by Cohen and his generation of Americans, which included segregation and the black civil rights struggle (Cohen grew up in the Jim Crow South); the social political barricade in American life generated by the Vietnam War (Cohen was draft age and a graduate student at Columbia during the 1968 events on that campus); or the religious political division over abortion rights during several electoral cycles And these divisions leave aside those associated with Watergate, which drove a president from office, and the actual impeachment of President Bill Clinton To assert that the much lesser divisions in 2016 were any less American in origin or needed to be exacerbated by Russia is a kind of unwitting or willful amnesia Certainly, such allegations are uninformed by history § Closely related is the allegation that Russian propaganda and disinformation has been playing, at least since 2016, an oversized role in American life and continues to do so But Cohen vividly recalls, at least since his schoolboy days in Kentucky, that this was an everyday allegation back then as well, including during the civil rights struggle Indeed, the primary source of those dire warnings was none other than the longtime director of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover, whose writings were very often assigned readings in schools Hoover s essential theme was, of course, that Americans posing as loyal citizens were actually agents of Soviet (Russian) Communist propaganda and disinformation And that allegation was also widely used for political purposes, and perhaps widely believed Still more, when blacklisting came to Hollywood in the 1950s, films were investigated for latent Communist propaganda, which was purportedly found This was a search, so to speak, for Russian trolls  in the movies, and Cohen cites a particularly preposterous example, not unlike those being found today in ongoing investigations § On these flimsy and historically uninformed premises, Russiagaters go on to allege that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election, which results in their warmongering charge that this was an act of war against America Whatever meddle means the word is very imprecise states have meddled in the elections of other states for centuries, in one form or another Israel has, of course, meddled in US elections for decades More to the point,according to a study cited recently byThe New York Times, the US government ran 81 overt and covert election influence operations in foreign countries from 1946 to 2000 (Soviet and post Soviet Russia ran 36 such operations during the same period) Indeed, any informed observer knows that official and unofficial American institutions have been very deeply involved in meddled in Russian political life generally ever since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 (See Stephen F Cohen,Failed Crusade: America and the Tragedy of Post Communist Russia ) But the instance that should dispel any amnesia, unwitting or otherwise, is the financial, on site, hands on American effort to help a badly failing President Boris Yeltsin get reelected in 1996 (There is some doubt as to whether he really was) Nor was this especially covert An attentive visitor to Moscow that year could observe parts of it, as Cohen did And afterwards, no secret was made of it, only prideful boasts ATimemagazine cover story declared, Yanks to the Rescue And in 2003 Showtime made a feature film, still available for viewing on demand, glorifying the meddling, calledSpinning Boris That is, Americans acted as foreign agents in a Russian presidential election, and proudly Two wrongs may not make a right, but less amnesia would put the considerably lesser Russiagate allegations, almost none of the truly significant ones yet having been proved, in perspective § One way or another, to some degree or another, at least two US intelligence agencies, the CIA and FBI, have played unsavory roles in Russiagate And yet most mainstream American media and leading Democrats in particular are exalting them as paragons of verified, nonpartisan information, including their recurring leaks to media This is puzzling and probably best explained by willful amnesia or denial, since not a few of these same media and politicians had been highly skeptical, even sharply critical, of both agencies roles in the past Leave aside well documented assassinations by the CIA and FBI persecution of civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr Recall instead only the quality of CIA information that led President John F Kennedy to the Bay of Pigs disaster; President Lyndon B Johnson and Congress ever deeper into the Vietnam War; and the nation to the catastrophic war in Iraq, whose consequences still plague the Middle East and America today And yet the information provided by the CIA regarding Russiagate is to be accepted uncritically? Is its past role, and that of the FBI, forgotten or forgiven? § Unable to provide proof linking Russia or President Trump to the alleged original sin the hacking and dissemination of DNC emails media investigators and special counsel Robert Mueller himself have settled for seeking and prosecuting past financial misdeeds on the part of Trump associates, Paul Manafort in particular (Since Manafort s laundered millions are said to have originated mostly in Ukraine, not Russia, perhaps all of this is actually Ukrainegate?) But here too precedents are forgotten or deleted The shock therapy urged on Russia by Washington in the 1990s led to the creation of a small group of billionaire oligarchs and the globalization  of their wealth, especially between the United States and Russia Predictable scandals ensued Two resulted in very high profile US convictions for money laundering and other financial improprieties, not unlike the charges against Manafort One involved the Bank of New York; the other aHarvard University institute Both featured high level Kremlin linked  officials of the Yeltsin government, which the Clinton administration, to say the least, strongly supported In various ways, one dwarfed the charges against Manafort financially, and both did so politically In the end, however, the Manafort case and other Russiagate financial ones, like their predecessors, are likely to turn out to be mostly the everyday corruption of the 1 percent and its servitors This too seems to have been forgotten or, considering the fully bipartisan nature of that corruption, deleted § A final example is particularly remarkable Even though the new or second  Cold War with Russia has been unfolding for nearly 20 years, the head of America s most prestigious think tank and foreign affairs organizationdiscovered itonly recently and unexpectedly Is such myopia on the part of one of America s most esteemed foreign policy experts amnesia he did not remember what the preceding Cold War looked and sounded like or is it denial of the role he and his fellow experts had played in bringing about the second one ? Whatever the explanation, all of these aspects of Russiagate are, of course, part of the new, more dangerous US Russian Cold War Which leads Cohen to worry that Marx s famous adage history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce may in this case turn out to be, first as tragedy, then as even worse By Stephen F Cohen Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University and Princeton University and a contributing editor of The Nation This article was originallypublishedby The Nation The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/420283-russiagate-cia-fbi-meddling/
"23 Feb, 2018","If West Bank is given independence, itâll become a terrorist state - ex-IDF intel chief","The cost of the Israeli military presence in Palestine is high living with a constant threat of a general violent uprising, relentless international pressure, and growing domestic weariness of the situation But with Jewish settlements all over the West Bank, can the Israeli troops ever just leave the settlers to their fate?

Amos Yadlin, former director of Israel s military intelligence shared his view Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:General Yadlin, it s really great to have you on our show Welcome Amos Yadlin:I m happy to be in Moscow SS:We re happy you re here Palestinians have dismissed America s leading role in the Middle East peace process and want Moscow, Russia to provide a platform for multilateral negotiations Would Israel take part in this proposed new format? Is Moscow viewed as a trustworthy mediator by Israeli? AY:I think you should go basically to a much more important issue That s why Palestinians are avoiding every opportunity to reach an agreement If you go back to 2000 with Barak and Arafat in Camp David, they didn t agree to a very good proposal Later on they didn t agree to the Clinton Parameters Then in 2008 they got a wonderful deal from Prime Minister Olmert they haven t answered to this day Even Kerry who offered them in 2014 a very good deal they ran away This is the problem: it doesn t matter whether the Russians will put the offer on the table or the Americans will do it Back to your question which I m not avoiding, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel will not leave the American mediation I ll tell you that the only country that can get real concessions for Israel is the US, they have the leverage The Russians don t have the leverage even though Russia is respected in Israel, we see it as a friendly country SS:Like you re saying, Israel has traditionally enjoyed Washington s support, but   just recently President Trump said that he doubts that Israel is interested in making peace with Palestine Do you think it s a valid concern? AY:I think he said a lot of things and you take only one of them No doubt that both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abu Mazen took position in the last couple of years that take peace farther rather than closer to us Both of them have now positions which cannot enable us to close the gap The gap between the Palestinians and the Israelis is huge The maximum that each side is willing to give to the other side is not up to the minimum of the other side And what is the tragedy, Sophie? We all know what are the parameters for a permanent deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians It is basically the Clinton Parameters And everybody knows that each side should do very painful concessions that go against their national narratives, their values, their beliefs, their religions The Palestinians have to agree to recognise that Israel is a Jewish state and this is the end of conflict and finality of claim They have to agree that there is no right of return to Israel, only to the Palestinian state, and that Israel has legitimate demands on its security The Israelis have to agree to a Palestinian state, to go back to basically 1967 borders to partition of Jerusalem Rabin wasn t here Abu Mazen isn t willing to make concessions Bibi for sure isn t here SS:Let s go point by point to what you ve just say From what it looks from the outside to someone who s not Palestinian or Israeli, it does look like there s endless negotiation of peace while protecting your own goals Reaching your own goals is convenient for everyone If you strike a deal, if there s a compromise, you have to abide by them, make concessions Do you feel that maybe the current status quo is actually better than a fixed settlement? AY:If depends on the settlement You see, the status quo is more sustainable than many are thinking However, as an Israeli I don t see the status quo deserves, I want to have a resolution to the conflict I want to have Israel shaped as Jewish, democratic, secure, with a moral upper hand again This is very important to me Somebody has to convince me, that by moving from a status quo I m not going to a more problematic situation And I have to remind you that Israelis have done two big moves towards resolution of the conflict: the Oslo Accord which ended up with Arafat launching a terror campaign against us with 1500 Israelis killed, and then the withdrawal from Gaza We withdrew from Gaza to the last inch, we dismantled the settlements there what we got? Good neighbors? We got a terror organisation, which is launching rockets to our villages, to our kibbutzim, digging tunnels So instead of having good neighbors we have Hamastan which is a terror state SS:We have what we have right now the situation is quite different I ve spoken to the Palestinian side recently You ve said what compromises they have to make to reach a peace deal You tell me in your own words one more time what can Israel make to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians? AY:That s a good point because the Palestinians are not united Even if the Israeli left will be in power they will go to Ramallah to negotiate with Abu Mazen Abu Mazen cannot deliver He s hardly controlling the West Bank, the terrorists of Hamas are controlling the Gaza Strip, they do not recognise the Oslo Agreement, they do not recognise Israel, they are not willing to denounce terror, they do not recognise the agreement between the PLO and Israel SS:So you cannot strike a deal with the West Bank overlooking Gaza? AY:I m saying that at the present moment, unfortunately, you cannot reach a permanent peace However what we should do today is to keep the two state solution alive, keep it a potential future resolution And there s a lot that can be done on both sides on interim steps If I were in a position of a mediator, US or Russian, I wouldn t try another secured failure I would try interim resolution, interim agreement that would keep the two state solution alive And I ll give you some parameters: freeze the Israeli settlements beyond the security line On the other side, let the Israelis continue building in the blocks Everybody understands that in the future they will be in the borders of Israel Develop the Palestinian economy, the Palestinian civil society bottom up Help them create a state that will not be another failed Arab state If you give the West Bank independence tomorrow they will be taken over by Hamas or ISIS in a second And we ll have another hostile failed Arab state This isn t something that anybody wants, even in Moscow and DC SS:General, I want to talk to you about the statement that you have made You said that Israel should move forward with the peace initiatives now, because it is in a strong position, while the international situation is in its favour What kind of terms do you see Israel dictating to the Palestinians if you re negotiating from a position of strength? Can that be a good thing for a lasting peace? Shouldn t both sides be balanced in a sort of strength position? Or will it be always Israel the strong one and Palestine the weak one? How is that good for a long lasting peace? AY:Sophie, Israel is a small country, surrounded by 350 million Arabs So the way you put it is the wrong way There are 1 7 billion Muslims So Israel has to be strong Otherwise we wouldn t live here It s a very tough neighborhood We have to keep our security as number one issue However, the Palestinians are backed by all these Arabs and Muslims This is making the symmetry much more normal philosophically to you question SS:Ok, talking about defense, you ve said that the 1967 borders should be the deal And that s what Palestinians want But Israel won t accept that because they think that those borders are completely indefensible from a military point of view So that leaves Israeli presence permanent in the West Bank and the Jordan valley, this is a never ending thing, right? AY:No, I haven t said that the 1967 borders are the borders of the final resolution This is the Clinton Parameters that, we all understand, a future agreement if ever achieved will be along these lines SS:But now the specifics the Israeli military will never leave those border lines? AY:Israel says that you have to differentiate between the people of Palestine who will have their own country with the will and capability to run their own business from security point of view (and this is one of the points which, I said, the Palestinians have to compromise on, that Israel security will not be compromised) I didn t said that Israel will control the West Bank, but on the Jordan valley will have a special arrangement And we re not going to repeat the mistakes that we have done in the withdrawal from Gaza After withdrawal from Gaza we left everything with no IDF present anywhere and the border between Gaza and Sinai was left open for all the weapons coming from Iran, Sudan, Libya, that violated one of the main principles that the Palestinian state should be demilitarised SS:Donald Trump has said that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are bad for peace Is this a signal that Israel shouldn t be counting on US indiscriminate support of its policies anymore? AY:Sophie, once again, you re taking one sentence out of the whole picture SS:But the sentence is the important sentence AY:The important sentence that Trump have said was that unlike the Obama administration he doesn t think the settlements are obstacle for peace They are not a good phenomenon, you re right, he said that too But, first of all, the conventional wisdom and the main allegation against Israel in the eight years of Obama administration and the Palestinians still sing that song, that the settlements are an obstacle for peace As an Israeli from the centre, not from the extreme right, not from the extreme left, I do agree that some of the settlements   those which are east of the security fence are not helping peace at this moment But if peace is reached this obstacle will be removed You have to look at it the other way round SS:But isn t it also a big part of reaching a peace deal It does seem that a growing number of settlements are dissecting the Palestinian territory everywhere, creating enclaves and exclaves, patches For some it may look like a plan that Israel may be never wanting a de facto independent Palestine You know what I mean? AY:I know exactly what you mean, and this is another myth If you look where are the main places where Israel is building, it s not the settlements east of the security fence It s in the Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem, it s in the blocks This is basically the Palestinian propaganda that, unfortunately, is bought by a lot of people in Europe SS:How sustainable from the economic point of view is this whole situation for Israel? I know the support inside Israel for all of this isn t unanimous AY:Israel is a democracy, we have the right, we have the left The right are for settlements, the left are against them The centre basically distinguishes the blocks east of the security line So there s an argument in Israel And I can promise you, most of the Israelis are still for the two state solution I m a head of the think tank that does a poll every year, and there is still 60% (it used to be 67%) in support of the two state solution If a reasonable agreement is put forward by US, Russia or the Quartet, and the Palestinians agree to that, settlements will not be an obstacle for peace, as it was not in Gaza in 2005 SS:Do you think annexing the settlements is a possibility? I m asking that because I know that Netanyahu is always emphasizing the fact that any peace deal would include settlements closer to Israel proper, perhaps leading to their annexation AY:Once again, 5 6% of the territory which the blocks are build upon will be part of Israel We agreed to the that not only in the right, but in the Israeli centre What Olmert gave Abu Mazen, and what he, unfortunately, didn t take, is a swap Ok, we will take 5 6%, you will get part of Israel to be part of Palestine To keep 100% percent of the 1967 partition is the right balance But the Palestinians refused So the Israelis are not going to evacuate half a million people from the settlements The numbers we re talking about are 60, 70, 80 thousand, and it s not going to be easy SS:I want to ask you about the other thing that Netanyahu is emphasizing: he says that any peace deal with Palestine will include the Israeli security control over the West Bank You know, the Palestinians are calling the IDF presence in the West Bank an occupation, how would that work out? AY:I told you that security will not be compromised And there are many methods to make security with, let s call it, a stealthy profile The configuration should be as low as possible The head of Brookings Institute General John Allen had a team that worked on that in 2014 to make the Israelis feel secure on one hand and not to humiliate or make Palestinians feel that they aren t controlling their own territory Once again let me remind you that the Palestinians never answered to Secretary Kerry and President Obama s proposals in 2014 Prime Minister Netanyahu basically accepts the framework, although with some reservation SS:I want to talk about the international law point of view I know you have a friendly president in America, but when it comes to things like building the barrier along the Green Line, building settlements, even claiming the whole of Jerusalem that goes against international law, that s the general acknowledgement of things Right now this isn t relevant for Israel, Israel doesn t even care, it does what it sees fit But do you think eventually the whole legal pressure from the international community could catch up with Israel? AY:There are different interpretations to the international law You re taking one interpretation, we have another interpretation You know, nobody ever recognised a Palestinian state, there was no Palestinian state until 1967 No one recognised the occupation of Jerusalem by Jordan except for two countries Pakistan and UK So, what used to be the British mandate of Palestine there are different interpretations of what the international law is saying And I think, the principles that everybody accepts, I heard even Foreign Minister Lavrov say that the future of all the parameters for peace will be decided in negotiations Unfortunately, the Palestinians are unwilling to come to negotiations because they know that they have to do some concessions SS:You re talking about the recognition of the Palestinian state Slovenia is nursing the idea of recognising the state of Palestine Sweden did this, Ireland, Belgium and some other EU members are thinking of following this lead Israel is strongly opposed to that I don t really understand why But what s wrong with it? Israel says it supports a two state solution Palestinians were promised their own state What s wrong with recognising the state of Palestine? AY:The devil is in details When you say you recognise the Palestinian state, in what borders do you recognise it? Are you recognising the right of the Palestinian refugees to come back to Israel? Are you recognising other demands of the Palestinians which are unacceptable? A Palestinian state should be a result of a negotiated resolution SS:A two state solution is not happening so far Let s face it A one state solution isn t what Israel wants because you don t want to absorb 2,5 million Palestinians into 7 million Israelis So what kind of options are left for Israel? AY:I ve already shown you the option The option is to try again to reach an agreement If that is impossible try reach a regional agreement that the Arabs would join, where they can put some ideological, financial, even security value on the table by offering the Israelis something, offering the Palestinians something and pushing two sides to make concessions If this is not working I m recommending the Israelis an independent move supported by the US and Arabs Let s say the Palestinians are so extreme, they so don t want to make a compromise Let s do a halfway interim agreement to keep the two state solution alive even if we cannot reach it today SS:Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital   do you feel it s helping the Israeli Palestinian peace process? Or on the contrary? AY:I don t think, it s disturbing as the Palestinians are claiming If you listen very carefully to Trump s speech, he basically said: I recognise the reality I recognise the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel  The coordinates of places in Jerusalem that he mentioned, the Knesset, the Parliament, is in Jerusalem, the PM s office is in Jerusalem, the Supreme Court is in Jerusalem all of them are in West Jerusalem If I were Palestinian, I would embrace his speech, say, you know, all these places are in West Jerusalem Trump said in the same speech that the future borders will be decided in negotiations between Israel and Palestine He said that the status quo of Haram al Sharif is not going to change This basically can play to the Palestinian demands Why have they made such a big deal out of it? Let me tell you a secret They knew that the Trump plan was coming and they would again be losing the blame game, they again would be refusing to another plan after Kerry, Clinton etc So they preempted They preempted on Jerusalem thinking that Jerusalem is the case that would get a lot of support in the Arab world, in the Muslim world And here s another surprise Most of the Arab world is now worried about Syria, Libya, Yemen and the Iranian hegemony in the Middle East, they aren t that much interested in the Palestinians anymore SS:Just the last question Former Palestinian foreign minister told me that it was kind of a last drop for the Palestinians to recognise Jerusalem as Israeli capital, and this could actually provoke another intifada, a violent uprising  AY:False! We re two, three months since the declaration You remember the predictions? There were predictions of World War III, that the Middle East would be in fire, terror all over, that the American embassies would be bombed Nonsense! I wrote two weeks before the declaration that this is an empty gun and they cannot threaten us with it Either way the Palestinians should look at themselves Who started the argument on Jerusalem? They went to UNESCO with an unbelievable, out of context to history argument that Jews have no connection to Jerusalem 3000 years we are there, we built the city and the Palestinian suddenly say that we have no connection to Jerusalem If they come with this argument I don t blame Trump for telling them the truth SS:General Yadlin, thank you very much for this interview All the best of luck!

"15 Dec, 2017","Geert Wilders: Trump & Putin put interests of their nations first, European leaders to do the same","The rise of the political right is being felt across Europe and the Netherlands is no exception, where controversial politician Geert Wilders, a veteran of the game, took second place with his party in this year s elections Will his radical policies now make it into the Dutch and the European mainstream? Geert Wilders was our guest Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Geert Wilders, welcome to the show It s great to have you with us one more time In the Dutch election in March, you were tipped to win, but that didn t quite happen Was that a clear sign to you that the Dutch people don t really like the changes you re proposing? Geert Wilders:No, exactly the opposite We were actually one of the winners, we got 30% of votes, we had 15 seats in the Dutch parliament before the elections, but after the elections we came up with 20 seats The party of the current Prime Minister Rutte has in fact lost many seats We became the second biggest party, so we were one of the biggest winners of the elections at the end of the day SS:You criticise the elites, the establishment, but you ve been part of Dutch politics for 20 years, aren t you the elite and the establishment? GW:That s a good question You know, it s not about how long you ve been in politics but what you propose to do I think the Dutch politicians and government should listen to the Dutch people But they don t In Holland it s not like America First or Russia First but Holland Last When it comes to the European Union where we are the biggest net contributor, we pay our taxpayers money to the southern European countries, or when it comes to the mass immigration the Dutch electorate have made a very bad deal What I propose is that we listen more to the people And the people want the sovereign and strong Netherlands Let s work with other countries if they see fit and share our interests, not let s not be as stupid as the today s policies SS:After the elections in France and the Netherlands, right leaning parties, like yours, had a strong showing French president Macron and German chancellor Merkel even started talking about serious reform of the EU Will you be content with the reform they are proposing? GW:You know, when European politicians or people in favour of the European Union talk about the European reform, what they actually mean is not reform but   more European Union And indeed parties like mine want the elections As I told you, we are the second biggest party in the Dutch parliament where we have thirteen or fourteen parties And Marine Le Pen s party, as you ve rightfully mentioned, has become the second party in France FPO (The Freedom Party of Austria) has become the second biggest party in Austria and is probably going to govern as well In Germany we saw the Alternative for Germany party become the third biggest party Our voice of millions of Europeans is getting stronger today and we don t want more European reform, we want more national sovereignty We want less European Union And my party wants [the Netherlands] to leave the European Union We believe that we can only be sovereign and in charge of our own front door when it comes to immigration if we are outside the European Union We want to become a strong sovereign nation again SS:Your party is called The Party for Freedom and you talk about freedom all the time, but at the same time, you re suggesting closing mosques all over the Netherlands and making Islam unattractive How does this go along with the freedom that you re promoting? GW:Well, that s a very good question Actually I believe that Islam and freedom are incompatible Look at those countries where Islam is dominant today and you ll see a total lack of freedom, civil society, rule of law and a lack of both individual and collective rights I believe, the more we fight against the islamisation of societies the more we preserve our freedom So I fight for freedom and I called my party The Party for Freedom because I want my family, my children and my grandchildren even in 50 years [from now] to be free citizens If we become more Islamic one day it will change our freedom for the worse SS:What about the freedom of practicing your religion? You talk about your children and grandchildren, but you never know, one of them may marry a Muslim one day or turn into Islam, you great grandchildren may be Muslim What about their freedom of practicing their religion? It s a choice, right? GW:Well, our constitution, as you ve fairly mentioned, talks about the freedom of religion But I believe Islam is not a religion but more of an ideology, a totalitarian ideology that wants to dominate over not only people s personal lives but the whole society One of the examples I usually give to show that Islam is more an ideology and not a religion is that when you want to leave Islam the penalty is death You are not free, as it is in Christianity, Judaism or Buddhism, to leave This is a token of a totalitarian ideology Yes, we have the freedom of religion in the Dutch constitution But if we see Islam not so much as a religion but as a totalitarian ideology that, once again, doesn t want to assimilate in our society but to dominate it, it goes against the freedom of women, homosexuals, Christians and Jews, press So if you want to have society that is free you have to have less Islam SS:I m not advocate of Islam, I m Christian myself, but I think what you re talking about is a very narrow following in Islam that may be called Wahhabism or extreme Islam But I don t think that applies to the majority of Muslim people And the same thing can be said about Christianity if you go really deep into the Bible it goes against gays and   women rights It s really about how you read religion Anyway, you ve been saying that there s no such thing as moderate Islam But at a conference in Italy in September you said that many individual Muslims are moderates  Who are these moderate Muslims if there s no moderate Islam according to you? GW:Listen, I make a distinction, as I always did, between the ideology and the people And, indeed, there s no moderate Islam, there s no European Islam or this kind of nonsense There s only Islam of the Quran, of the life of [the Prophet] Mohammed and that is the only Islam we know Unfortunately, it cannot and it will never be changed Extreme Islam is a pleonasm, it means exactly the same On the other hand, you have the people And I do believe in moderate people And indeed I do acknowledge that there are many Muslims around the world who are moderate But unfortunately, and this is one of the differences of Islam from Christianity or Judaism, today we see societies where Muslims are in large numbers or even the majority and there is a total lack of freedom and democracy whether you talk about more liberal countries like Egypt or tougher ones like Iran, the Sunni Muslim country Even in my own country, the Netherlands, we have almost one million Muslims today The leftist liberal institutions like the University of Amsterdam have made a survey and it proved that 11% of the Dutch Muslims more than a hundred thousand people which is twice the amount of the Dutch army stated that they are willing to use violence in Holland for their beliefs, for Islam We don t see that in any other religion This is what we are importing in the West today We don t see terrorist acts being committed on a monthly and sometimes on a weekly basis all over Europe in the name of Christianity or Judaism Indeed, not every Muslim is a terrorist but unfortunately most of the terrorists in Europe today are Muslims We can be politically correct and ignore it But I think, it s a lot wiser to address this issue SS:The Islamist terror threat to Europe is of course very real But don t you think that measures like this (closure of mosques and a tough crackdown on Muslims) could work the other way round increase the risk of terror attacks rather than reduce it? GW:No, exactly the opposite We have to stand up We don t have to call every Muslim a terrorist, that would be ridiculous I would even reject such a suggestion But we should not import Islam On the contrary, we should de Islamise our society The Quran has more anti semitism in it than Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler, for example We should see it for what it is Not all people are bad people On the contrary But this ideology is a dangerous ideology When I was still a free man and wasn t protected by the diplomatic police 24/7, when I didn t have threats from Al Qaeda and other organisations in my head I travelled throughout the Middle East and I went to almost every Islamic country I met a lot of friendly and hospitable people But I saw that the influence of Islam on almost every Arab and Islamic country was devastating People weren t free There was terror even within the Islamic world, let alone in the countries that are importing Islam We should do one thing: define who we are We are not an Islamic country Our continent is based on Christianity and Judaism, on humanism And Islam should not become dominant here at the end of the day SS:Like you said, your opinions on Islam have landed you on the al Qaeda hit list I know you are surrounded by security 24\7, you live in a safehouse does all this isolation get to your head? A politician has to be close to the people I can imagine that being detached from everyday reality isn t good for that? GW:Listen, last election my party out of thirteen parties in the parliament won one third of votes and we became the second biggest party in Holland We ve been only existing for ten years It never happened before that a relatively new party became the second biggest party in the parliament We are not detached, we re maybe attached even more [to people] than any other party look at the outcome of the democratic election It s not easy, I fight for the freedom of my people, for the freedom of the West as I see it and in this process I ve lost my personal freedom Let me tell you, if I criticised Christianity or Judaism, though I don t, I wouldn t be on the hit list, wouldn t lose my personal freedom and people wouldn t try to murder me And that s exactly my point I m not the only one There are other people, organisations, journalists and politicians who criticise Islam and they get into the same trouble Moderation is far to reach for in Islam SS:The refugee problem spiralling out of control has got Europe questioning one of its greatest achievements open borders do you feel the Schengen zone has to go and the free movement of people across Europe with it? GW:That s the only way to get rid of the Schengen zone The only way is that we have to stop immigration from the Middle East or Africa If you think that the refugee crisis that we ve seen over the last few years when all the so called asylum seekers came to our part of the world, was bad, I would say, you haven t seen anything yet If you look at the figures from the United Nations you will see that there will be a quadrupling of the inhabitants of Africa Africa is inhabited by one billion people today and by the end of the century this figure will grow up to four billion people Surveys proved that over one third of these people would want to emigrate most probably to the richer part of North Africa and to Europe So if we don t wake up, stop Schengen, become masters of our own house and be in charge of our frontiers we will cease to exist I m not exaggerating If you look at the numbers, we re facing the existential problem today, worse than any economic problem we faced before It s the existential problem of whether we will exist or not by the end of the century if we don t start defining our border controls and deciding for ourselves who we let in our house and who should leave it, like all normal people in Russia or elsewhere We don t have that in Europe We only know the policies of open borders and at the end of the day it won t be our house anymore SS:Wouldn t closing the Schengen zone actually destroy the European Union? GW:It won t be a bad thing to me I m very much against the European Union I m a lot in favour of Europe, I think we should work together with other European countries in areas of common interest, for instance, in the internal market or counterterrorism, economic ties I would really want to cooperate But we don t need an institution like the European Union where mostly unelected people, like old European commissioners are deciding for our democracies what to do If you talk about immigration, Brussels is in charge of our immigration rules today National governments have transferred most of immigration policies to Brussels so we re not in charge of our front door any more So it would rather be a good thing, not bad, if the institution called European Union is eroded SS:You ve said that hysterical Russophobia reigns in Europe and in the Netherlands Why is that, doesn t Europe have enough problems without this being drummed up too? GW:A very terrible thing is happening in most European countries On one hand, they criticise the American administration, make fun of Mr Trump I m not defending Mr Trump and all the things he does But 99% of politicians criticise one of the superpowers of the world, the United States of America On the other hand, the same politicians criticise the other superpower of the world called the Russian Federation I think this is very unwise from a mature political point of view and from the economical point of view I think we need both friendship with Russia and transatlantic partnership with the United States of America Indeed, you see a European trend to criticise Russia, to blame it for almost everything that goes wrong in the world That s very bad We cannot only afford it and it s often not substantialized Of course, I also have some criticism towards Russia and the United States But it s in our interests, as we and Russia have lots of things in common, to be allies, not enemies SS:You ve said that you want to create an alternative to this Russophobia What is it going to be like? How do you make this alternative appealing to the political elites? GW:Allies should be able to criticise each other as friends when it s needed Of course, when it comes to the terrible terrorist attack against my fellow countrymen,   the shutting down of MH17 plane, or other things there s a lot of criticism or asking for cooperation towards Russia But we also have so much in common with Russia on other aspects We have the same kind of culture, we are Christians, a big part of Russia is Orthodox Christian We have the same problems when it comes to the future of immigration We both have had bad experience when it comes to terrorism We have the same kind of experience that Russia had in Moscow or in Chechnya in the past We shouldn t only criticise but we should cooperate I m very happy to have been invited by the Russian ambassador to visit Russia and the Russian parliament in the beginning of the next year I will be happy to meet your government, to exchange some critical remarks and, also, get a better understanding Russia is not our enemy I believe, Russia is our ally and we should invest in better relations SS:The media has been calling you the Dutch Donald Trump What do you make if this comparison? Do you feel you have many things in common with the American president? GW:I have respect for Mr Trump on some aspects And I don t have respect for what he does on other aspects I still believe if I were American I would have voted for Mr Trump and not for Mrs Clinton But I am not an American I am a Dutchman and I am responsible for the policies of my country despite being in opposition today So I am not to be compared But I think the strength of Mr Trump and, also, Mr Putin is that they believe that the interests of their countries go first Mr Putin goes for Russia First , for the interests of the Russian people Mr Trump does the same for his own country I wish that we had in Europe and in my country, the Netherlands, the leader who would say, like Mr Trump or Mr Putin, Holland First or Europe First And we don t have that SS:I want to talk a bit about the EU s relations with the United States Chancellor Angela Merkel thinks the EU has to rely on itself from now on, as the partnership between the U S and Europe is cracking under Donald Trump Do you see a reliable partner in the current U S administration? GW:I don t think this is that bad I believe, European politicians misuse it saying that the relations with the United States of America are bad They complain about bad relations with the U S or Russia only to be able to say to their people that we need more European Union But, please, don t be fooled by the politicians like Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, the President of France, who says that we need to have a stronger Europe We even get the European Army today But we don t need any European Army The politicians make people afraid of bad relations with Russia or with the U S only to enforce supranationalism of the European Union That s the real reason and something I don t subscribe to SS:The EU during the Obama years followed American policies closely but now that there s a difference of opinion with Trump, will the U S lose its influence over Europe? GW:I think, America is an important ally to Europe The Americans are our friends as Russian people should be But, of course, there are different administrations And even though some people may criticise or applaud the measures the American administration takes, we cannot afford bad relations with both America and Russia at the end of the day What many politicians do by criticising only the Russian and the American administrations is very irresponsible America is an important ally and Mr Trump is the president of an important country So is Mr Putin And we should have good relations with both of them SS:Mr Wilders, thank you for being with us We were talking to Geert Wilders, head of the Dutch Party for Freedom, discussing the pressing issues Europe is facing today  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/413283-geert-wilders-europe-immigration/

"25 Sep, 2017",Star-Spangled anger: NFL anthem boycott low blow to US patriotism,"For those who think American football is just a game, they may want to reevaluate that opinion in light of a new trend among NFL players, many of whom are refusing to stand during the national anthem as a form of protest Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge No other spectacle unites the American people more than the game of football (not to be confused with the European variety, which Americans rather condescendingly refer to as soccer ) Every weekend, Americans across the country gather en masse at local schools, stadiums, and living rooms to watch beefy players smash heads on the field of dreams and concussions in a great collective effort to move an inflated ball of cowhide across the goal line This violent, gritty sport gives Americans a welcomed relief from their daily travails as they focus their limited attention span on the game That is, until now READ MORE: Wave of anthem protests across NFL as Trump clashes with players & owners (VIDEOS, PHOTOS) The holy grail of American pastimes received a body blow in August 2016 when San Francisco s quarterback Colin Kaepernick attracted the all seeing tentacles of the media octopus when he refused to stand during the opening national anthem Kaepernick explained his ill conceived decision as a way of protesting the spate of police violence against minorities I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, KaepernicktoldNFL Media To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder Despite the fact that football, and other professional sports, has made many African Americans very wealthy, Kaepernick has a point Indeed, barely a week goes by without some news report of police brutality against African Americans And as the tragic case with Freddie Gray, 25, whose premature death while in police custody sparked weeks of protests, the offending officers regularly escape punishment for their deplorable actions DoJ won t bring federal charges against officers involved in#FreddieGray s death, Gray s family lawyer announceshttps:// tdotco /oT5Dgk98eN More on that later Though Kaepernick is now stuck in the unemployment line, his solitary act of civil disobedience has sparked a wave of copycat protests across a wide swath of the National Football League (NFL) In fact, the movement even attracted the attention of President Donald Trump, who never met a national crisis that he didn t inflame Wouldn t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, Get that son of a bitch off the field right now Out! He s fired He s fired!  Trump, once again confusing the presidential office with a television game show, told a cheering crowd in Alabama last week Get that son of a b* off the field :#Trumpblasts NFL players for US anthem protests (VIDEOS)https:// tdotco /s8AXF068a0pic twitter com/e76VdaJKNi Needless to say, that inflammatory comment was the shot heard not only in the NFL, but around the entire Washington Beltway, and now we see the great American pastime being dragged into the dead zone of cheap political intrigue Last week, only six NFL players took the knee during the opening hymn Trump s explosive comments, however, triggered amass showof defiance much of it stained no doubt by political opportunism as three teamsremainedin the locker room during the singing of the national anthem And of course, the media was there to capture every second of the pathetic drama as it unfolded, obsessing over the empty spaces on the field where once upon a game players proudly sang along to the words of the national anthem How did the patriotic script, reinforced by a thousand and one Hollywood films, go so horribly wrong? Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin gave a thoughtful explanation as to why his team decided to stay in the closet during the anthem We re not participating in the anthem today, Tomlin said, adding that the action was not to be disrespectful to the anthem but to remove the team from this circumstance If a guy feels a need to do something he should not be separated from his teammate who chooses not to, hesaid Before we continue, there are some important things to consider about the demographic composition of American football, a multi billion dollar industry not much different from the Ford Motor Company or McDonald s I love sports but not at this price I ve turned off & tuned outThey need USWe DON T need themGet your house in order@NFL#BoycottNFLpic twitter com/HzOoVdA3wF Although African American males represent justsix percentof the US population, they comprise nearly70 percentof the players in the National Football League To put it another way, of the NFL s 1,700 players, 1,200 of them are black This statistic becomes more striking when juxtaposed to another: Unarmed black Americans, per capita, are five times as likely as unarmed white Americans to be shot and killed by the police,accordingto The Washington Post In other words, there is undoubtedly a need for a national debate on the issue of police abuse and minorities The problem, however, is that the very things that unite the country not least of all the sacred national anthem and the flag are being held hostage to promote this debate Let s face it, NFL players, many of whom are celebrities in their own right, have many other ways of attracting public attention to a particular cause without mangling a time honored tradition that is as American as apple pie The behavior of these superstars is not something any American could be proud of, and this will certainly have a profound impact on the whole notion of patriotism, especially when we consider the millions of American youngsters who look to these overpaid professionals for guidance Statement from#PatriotsChairman & CEO Robert Kraft:pic twitter com/f5DJeK0Woj The other problem is the ugly politicization of the situation, thanks no less to Trump himself, of course However, it s important to remember that the issue of excessive police force has been a problem in American society long before the mogul of Manhattan crashed the scene Indeed, America s first black president Barack Obama (who, incidentally, just like Colin Kaepernick, was born to a white mother and a black father), althoughcondemningpolice brutality on several occasions, never took serious measures to slow themilitarizationof America s local police forces, which are not only getting military grade weapons and vehicles, but the brutal military training that goes with it It should therefore be no surprise that local police are using the firepower and training they receive This disturbing trend, which began under Bill Clinton, continues unabated with Trump today Finally, the obvious question for any observer is: How much more divisive can the United States become before it finally collapses under its own weight? What will be the final straw that breaks the nation s back? Personally, I am inclined to believe there is some sort of motivation on the part of the political powers that be to actually encourage these deep fissures in American society, which allow for other agendas to be fulfilled In other words, the age old sport of divide and conquer that has been played long before football As Americans are busy debating the desecration of the national anthem, and numerous other gone with the wind traditions, the American military juggernaut continues further apace, destroying foreign countries, without a single peep from the sheep And now that the NFL superstars have finally decided to wage a protest, they use with no loss of irony the most sacred American traditions flag and anthem to advance their cause Such a game plan on the part of the National Football League is a recipe for national disaster America may survive Donald Trump, but it won t survive if the national symbols of patriotism are vanquished for other causes, whatever they may be @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/404561-anthem-nfl-trump-symbol-patriotism/

 I thought about the decency and good faith when recalling my own first experiences as a young reporter in Vietnam: watching hypnotically as the skin fell off Napalmed peasant children like old parchment, and the ladders of bombs that left trees petrified and festooned with human flesh General William Westmoreland, the American commander, referred to people as termites  In the early 1970s, I went to Quang Ngai province, where in the village of My Lai, between 347 and 500 men, women and infants were murdered by American troops (Burns prefers the term killings ) At the time, this was presented as an aberration: an American tragedy (Newsweek)  In this one province, it was estimated that 50,000 people had been slaughtered during the era of American free fire zones  Mass homicide This was not news To the north, in Quang Tri province, more bombs were dropped than in all of Germany during the Second World War Since 1975, unexploded ordnance has caused more than 40,000 deaths in mostly South Vietnam ,the country America claimed to save and, with France, conceived as a singularly imperial ruse The meaning of the Vietnam war is no different from the meaning of the genocidal campaign against the Native Americans, the colonial massacres in the Philippines, the atomic bombings of Japan, the leveling of every city in North Korea The aim was described by Colonel Edward Lansdale, the famous CIA man on whom Graham Greene based his central character inThe Quiet American Quoting Robert Taber sThe War of the Flea, Lansdale said, There is only one means of defeating an insurgent people who will not surrender, and that is extermination There is only one way to control a territory that harbours resistance, and that is to turn it into a desert  Nothing has changed When Donald Trump addressed the United Nations on 19 September a body established to spare humanity the scourge of war  he declared he was ready, willing and able to totally destroy North Korea and its 25 million people His audience gasped, but Trump s language was not unusual His rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, had boasted she was prepared to totally obliterate Iran, a nation of more than 80 million people This is the American Way; only the euphemisms are missing now Returning to the US, I am struck by the silence and the absence of an opposition on the streets, in journalism and the arts, as if dissent once tolerated in the mainstream has regressed to a dissidence: a metaphoric underground There is plenty of sound and fury at Trump the odious one, the fascist ,but almost none at Trump the symptom and caricature of an enduring system of conquest and extremism Where are the ghosts of the great anti war demonstrations that took over Washington in the 1970s? Where is the equivalent of the Freeze Movement that filled the streets of Manhattan in the 1980s, demanding that President Reagan withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons from Europe? The sheer energy and moral persistence of these great movements largely succeeded; by 1987 Reagan had negotiated with Mikhail Gorbachev an Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) that effectively ended the Cold War Today, according to secret Nato documents obtained by the German newspaper,Suddeutsche Zetung, this vital treaty is likely to be abandoned as nuclear targeting planning is increased  The German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has warned against repeating the worst mistakes of the Cold War All the good treaties on disarmament and arms control from Gorbachev and Reagan are in acute peril Europe is threatened again with becoming a military training ground for nuclear weapons We must raise our voice against this  But not in America The thousands who turned out for Senator Bernie Sanders revolution in last year s presidential campaign are collectively mute on these dangers That most of America s violence across the world has been perpetrated not by Republicans, or mutants like Trump, but by liberal Democrats, remains a taboo Barack Obama provided the apotheosis, with seven simultaneous wars, a presidential record, including the destruction of Libya as a modern state Obama s overthrow of Ukraine s elected government has had the desired effect: the massing of American led Nato forces on Russia s western borderland through which the Nazis invaded in 1941 Obama s pivot to Asia in 2011 signaled the transfer of the majority of America s naval and air forces to Asia and the Pacific for no purpose other than to confront and provoke China The Nobel Peace Laureate s worldwide campaign of assassinations is arguably the most extensive campaign of terrorism since 9/11 What is known in the US as the left has effectively allied with the darkest recesses of institutional power, notably the Pentagon and the CIA, to see off a peace deal between Trump and Vladimir Putin and to reinstate Russia as an enemy, on the basis of no evidence of its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election The true scandal is the insidious assumption of power by sinister war making vested interests for which no American voted  The rapid ascendancy of the Pentagon and the surveillance agencies under Obama represented an historic shift of power in Washington Daniel Ellsberg rightly called it a coup The three generals running Trump are its witness All of this fails to penetrate those liberal brains pickled in the formaldehyde of identity politics ,as Luciana Bohne noted memorably Commodified and market tested, diversity is the new liberal brand, not the class people serve regardless of their gender and skin color: not the responsibility of all to stop a barbaric war to end all wars How did it f cking come to this? says Michael Moore in his Broadway show,Terms of My Surrender, a vaudeville for the disaffected set against a backdrop of Trump as Big Brother I admired Moore s film,Roger & Me, about the economic and social devastation of his hometown of Flint, Michigan, andSicko, his investigation into the corruption of healthcare in America The night I saw his show, his happy clappy audience cheered his reassurance that we are the majority! and calls to impeach Trump, a liar and a fascist! His message seemed to be that had you held your nose and voted for Hillary Clinton, life would be predictable again He may be right Instead of merely abusing the world, as Trump does, the Great Obliterator might have attacked Iran and lobbed missiles at Putin, whom she likened to Hitler: a peculiar profanity given the 27 million Russians who died in Hitler s invasion Listen up, said Moore, putting aside what our governments do, Americans are really loved by the world!  There was a silence JohnPilger com the films and journalism of John Pilger The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/404299-killing-history-liberals-war-pilger/

SHG:I think this is the right approach, and there is nothing new here My predecessor Frank Walter Steinmeier, who is now the German president, held the same  view The conflict over Ukraine and Crimea is  a major problem In the 1970s, we signed a vital treaty in Europe We committed to respecting national borders and to never launching an intervention in a neighboring country For Germany to be a respected partner, we had to acknowledge the existing border with Poland And we said, yes, we do and without that treaty there would have been no reunification of Germany We have treaties that say we cannot intervene in a neighboring country But Russia did that, and we see this as a very serious violation of international law RT:Do you mean east of Ukraine or Crimea? SHG:Crimea, and of course the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Russia is involved in Russia is also involved in the four party format with Ukraine, Germany and France, aimed at finding a solution to the problem Despite their differences and despite the conflict, I believe that we all can all work towards a new dÃ©tente Willy Brandt, former German chancellor from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, started the dÃ©tente with the USSR in the darkest hours of the Cold War, when the troops entered Prague I think we need a new vision for peaceful coexistence in Europe Look at North Korea and what is happening there If the US, China, Europe and Russia had not been working together, we would not have been able to solve such problems RT:He is not a madman, but it is difficult to establish a dialogue when all we ve been hearing for so long is that he really is one SHG:I think that is a false assessment We have to look at what was happening before, when he seemed to have a clear strategy He decided, if I have nuclear weapons, no one will be able to bring me down That is why we first should ensure the security of North Korea It s not about regime change or military intervention I actually like that the suggestion that the US Secretary of State put forward North Korea s nuclear programme could encourage others to follow suit And we could end up with a very dangerous world Our children will live in a world more dangerous than the one we have today Other countries may say, look, it s actually possible To put an end to this threat, we need cooperation, first and foremost, between Russia, the U S and China And we Europeans can also play an important role in that Germany is part of this, when we say that we want to support the Russians, Americans and Chinese RT:As for Europe, you told HandelsblattthatEurope should be focused onforeignissues I assume, you meant that it is time to have a new foreign policy, whereas before Europe was moreinwardly focused What does Europe stand for what are itsvaluesandinterests? SHG:The truth is that in foreign affairs, both are important What makes Germany different is that we used to put our interests to one side, so as not to jeopardize our values RT:How does that correspond with the German arms trade policy? SHG:Are you sure this is a question for me? RT:Yes, because you re saying we need to have more respect for values than interests And that makes me wonder where are our values when we sell arms to autocratic states, like Saudi Arabia? SHG:What do we sell them? RT:Arms SHG:What kind of arms? RT:The regular kind SHG:What makes you say that? We are not doing that We have cut most of our arms trade with Saudi Arabia RT:But we used to SHG:Yes, in the past But when the Social Democratic Party gained power, the trade went down For example, I put a stop to Merkel s plan to manufacture 250,000 German assault rifles in Saudi Arabia And the plan didn t go through But if you ask me to choose between values and interests we obviously need to find a balance Germany has its interests, but we don t want to get to the point where we sacrifice our values freedom, democracy, human rights, peaceful coexistence of nations for economic interests But our foreign policy is guided by both values and interests You asked about Europe And you are right, Europe is focused on domestic affairs It was important after World War 2 in order to make sure that a new war did not happen, and maintain peace And Europe needs to have its own voice in global affairs In the past, we have often said that global politics are what the Americans do If something goes wrong, we will complain But I think we need to find our own voice We have partners and allies, including the US But we are a continent that needs to make sure that it is not just an appendage of someone else s foreign policy We have our own interests, and we need to represent our citizens in the world And it is in our best interests to make sure that there is no arms build up in Europe There is so little trust between Russia and the US that we are at a point where the disarmament treaties signed in the 1980s are greatly threatened RT:The 2% goal is still being discussed The chancellor wants to reach that goal, if I understand correctly But the SDP wants to move in a different direction How will the situation develop, if the Social Democratic Party of Germany does not get to play a significant role in the government? SHG:That s why we keep saying that those who want Germany to stay a peaceful nation, those who support a policy of de escalation, should vote for our party, which in my opinion, is the only possible choice in this situation Unfortunately, Angela Merkel and some other political players, such as the FDP, plan to double Germany s defense budget RT:But if the current status quo SHG:Let me finish my thought RT:Of course, I am sorry SHG:Doubling defense spending means that Germany will spend over 70 billion euros per year on weapons France, as a nuclear power, gets by with just 40 billion euros The entire federal budget is only 300 billion Where will we find money for education, aid for developing countries, and infrastructure, if we listen to Donald Trump and spend all these finances on defense? RT:President Obama also wanted this SHG:No, NATO never decided that 2% of GDP should be spent on defense Somehow this argument between Merkel and Trump made it sound like we owe something to someone But we don t have to do this I think it is a false idea There will be fewer wars and refugees in Africa, when the residents of those countries get more opportunities So, helping and investing in developing countries will bring more peace than doubling Germany s defense budget The Social Democratic Party will not let that happen RT:Since you called Germany a peaceful nation, I want to talk some more about the arms trade How can we be the number three or four (this number varies) weapons exporter? We sell a lot of weapons abroad I don t think this qualifies us as a peaceful nation SHG:We have made a lot of money selling weapons this past year   For example, we sold four tanker aircraft to the UK We do not pretend that we don t need the armed forces I think that both German and NATO forces must be adequately equipped But that is quite different from scaling up Frankly, selling four tanker aircraft to the UK does not threaten global peace and security, and does not suggest that Germany is NOT a peaceful nation It is nonsense RT:But this amount and four tanker aircraft SHG:It s one of the reasons why the amount was so high You have to understand one thing you can have large amounts and no major problems, and on the contrary sometimes smaller amounts cause bigger problems RT:Can you give an example? SHG:Small arms Small arms are used in civil wars all over the world Not tanks, not aircraft, but hand guns, machine guns, RPGs We pressured the current government into lowering the export of small arms For example, now nobody is allowed to manufacture German small arms abroad I am the last person to say that we don t need to be able to defend ourselves I just think that we need to monitor what is being manufactured and sold In my opinion, there should be more cooperation in Europe Even if we reach the mark of 50% of the US budget, but are only 15% efficient, it will be pointless And it s all because each country does its own thing RT:Do you support the idea of an EU Army? SHG:I think that at this point it is not a very realistic idea But we try to achieve the same goals without cooperation, wasting money And that doesn t make sense Cooperation would make sense But I can explain what I mean by peaceful nation  Germany needs to raise the issue of using monitoring mechanisms that are not working right now We need to discuss disarmament, we have to keep the current treaties between the US (or NATO) and Russia, like the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty It is a great treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev It is still valid, but is being threatened Germany s role is to make sure that the Iran nuclear deal doesn t fall apart Also I think we should look for mechanisms that will allow us to rebuild the European security architecture, as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe tried to do It doesn t seem realistic right now because of the major conflict with Russia But on the other hand, Vladimir Putin recently made a proposal that we need to take seriously He basically said, Let s send the UN Blue Helmets to Ukraine  We might disagree on the particulars of the mission But it would be insane not to sit at the negotiating table to discuss the idea and its implementation If we are able to achieve truce as the result of the UN involvement, then I think we will have to start talking about lifting sanctions Some Europeans think that sanctions should be lifted only when the Minsk agreements are 100% fulfilled, but I don t think it is a realistic approach RT:Speaking about the election campaign, and an opposition party, you said: we ll have Nazis in the Bundestag again  What do you mean by that? SHG:I m no good at lying The truth is, AfD leaders are just neo Nazis It doesn t mean RT:But you SHG:Please, let me finish It s a very important matter I m not saying all AfD supporters are Nazis But everyone who votes for them has to know it s led by neo Nazis They openly admit it when they say that we need to make a U turn in how we see our history What does that mean in terms of the Holocaust Memorial, Auschwitz, aggression against other European countries? What does it mean to make a U turn with our history? Grab what we had back then, what we got under criminals? I have to be honest about how I feel when I come to the Bundestag and see for the first time since 1945, since the end of WWII a Nazi taking the floor at the Reichstag It s depressing And we need to say this out loud, to say, Listen, there are many reasons to be dissatisfied with policies now and then, but thanks to our parents and grandparents Germany became a great country Many people come here to use the opportunities created by democracy, freedom and social security For many people we are what America was back in the 19th century Let s prevent them from ruining the treasure left in our care by our parents and grandparents  RT:But you know that after Nazism was eradicated, NSDAP members were among the Bundestag lawmakers And I wonder if you re downplaying that SHG:The fact that they were members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party   does not mean that they promoted Nazi ideology in the Parliament RT:But they were Nazis SHG:Right now you are talking to a social democrat whose fellow party members fought with people like the ones you referred to Our ancestors were sent to concentration camps, prisons and other penitentiary institutions Willy Brandt was exposed to libels from former Nazis Since then there have been none in our Parliament, even the old members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, who would openly promote Nazi ideas But it is being done RT:It means you see a line between SHG:I don t draw any lines, I am just telling you the truth You have people at the top of the AfD who incite a particular sentiment in other people, who promote Nazi propaganda Germany has not seen anything like this This threat ought not to be downplayed What you are doing right now and please do not hold any grudge against me is an outrageous disregard to the fact You cannot really compare the 1960s with RT:You seem to treat members of the National Socialist German Workers' Partydifferently from the Nazis from the AfD? SHG:The German Parliament has never given the floor either in Bonn or in Berlin to people who promote Nazi propaganda I think it will change Once again: not all members of the AfD and not all of their voters are Nazis But you have to be aware of the fact that some of the party leaders do have those ideas and they want to encourage other people to act in a particular way It is not just Alexander Gauland, there are other people who have lived off the state, who get a state pension and are now pitting the people against the government We know it can happen and it is happening right now It is outrageous But there are also people with really dark intentions It is people who will not work for the peace of our country or Europe We need to talk about it out loud RT:I would like to refer to a quote by Hillary Clinton who once called half of Trump s voters a basket of deplorables Do you have a concern that by talking in this way you only mobilize those people? We saw that in the US people responded to such statements in the following way: No, it is not true and I will vote for them anyway  SHG:First of all, I think we need to stop lying that there is no such issue at all Voters need to act responsibly, too You can t say: I want to live in the country, use the opportunities provided by the democratic system, and then disappointed by something vote for politicians who will destroy democracy Unlike other countries, this nation had prior experience of what could happen if these people become part of society I have never seen an election campaign like this one before, with so much ferocity, even violence, when members of democratic parties are exposed to verbal and sometimes physical attacks during door to door campaigning The country is in a good shape and we want to keep it that way We do not want discord and division Here are my two major points: we must expose the real intentions behind the ideology of people like BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, and at the same time talk to our citizens about their concerns I have always argued that Germany is facing the challenge of a dual integration: we need to help refugees settle down here and at the same time unite people who already live here You shouldn t create an impression that the authorities are doing everything for one group of people and nothing for the other I think Angela Merkel made a major mistake when she refused to back the idea of a minimum level of pension benefits It is something our nation needs Then I would be able to tell those communities that are seeing a wave of refugees: We will compensate your expenses on refugees and will also provide the same amount for your own residents  We need to pay to improve our schools, healthcare and child protection services so that people do not have a false impression that the authorities have forgotten about them But there is one thing we cannot agree on We cannot downplay the threat of what is happening in the minds and, unfortunately, hearts of some of the AfD s leadership This is a dangerous path for the country RT:It means there will be no dÃ©tente policy towards the AfD in the Parliament? SHG:There cannot be any dÃ©tente in our attitude towards Nazis, neo Nazis and right wing populists I cannot allow myself to downplay the threat as you do RT:Mr Gabriel, thank you for your time SHG:Thank you!

"20 Aug, 2017",Americans did not elect Donald Trump to expand foreign military intervention,"US President Donald Trump is finding his campaign promises increasingly difficult to fulfill, but his leaning towards military interventionism could be the most fundamental breach of trust for his Rust Belt supporters Across the globe, we see potential new Trump foreign military actions or the expansion of old ones The US leader recently made threats of US military action in Venezuela and North Korea (of the nuclear variety), US operations in Syria were ratcheted up and there has beenpressurefrom his advisers to expand rather than scale back US operations in Afghanistan It wasn t supposed to be this way The latest sacked apparatchik to emerge blinking into the light from the bunker of Trump s White House, Steve Bannon,admittedon Friday that the Trump Presidency was over And Trump s former chief strategist was no ordinary adviser Bannon most ably articulated what Trump and his supporters stood for Yet in his departing interview Bannon said: The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over  His [Trump s] actual default position is the position of his base, the position that got him elected I think you re going to see a lot of constraints on that I think it ll be much more conventional  Theinstancesof the permanent Government, the civil service, getting hold of a maverick leader and brow beating him into their way of thinking are myriad What Bannon calls the the West Wing Democrats  have been moderately successful with Trump Bannon was the arch advocate for ending the United States seven decades long policy of intervening in foreign states to pursue goals that were often of little consequence to the American people He  angered his boss bypointing outthat military intervention in North Korea, without causing the deaths of millions of South Koreans, was impossible Trump too was, until recently, a long term opponent of liberal internationalism Whilepromisingcaution and non interventionism in foreign policy, Trump labelled Hillary Clinton a trigger happy warmonger on the campaign trail There would be no more escapades like Iraq under President Trump He couldn t have been more emphatic with this anti interventioniststatementas he made it to George Bush s brother Jeb during a Republican Party primary debate After exchanges with his opponent Clinton last September, one assumed he was against any military actions in the Middle East Sometimes it seems like there wasn t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn t want to invade, he said of Barack Obama s former Secretary of State Trump promised to prioritize diplomacy over destruction and pledged that in his administration our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism  Still, during the same debate he pledged to institute a massive expansion of the US military He also said, in late 2015, that he intended to annihilate ISIS As always, it is difficult to decipher Trump s precise stances on an issue Yet on foreign policy look closer and you will see he has been steady down the years Trump has long harbored ambitions to become President, but it was not until 2016 that the political environment at home and abroad made an election run possible In those years of evolving political ambition he was, according to observing academics, remarkably consistent in his foreign policy Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institutewrotein January 2016, as Trump s campaign was getting serious, that he had a foreign policy similar to Charles Lindbergh s isolationist America First movement of the 1930s Wright wrote that Trump has maintained that America is getting raw deal from the liberal international order it helped to create in 1945 Trump s made contradictory statements over the neo Nazi attack in Charlottesville Initially, he issued a lukewarm condemnation of the attack, then, under pressure from his advisers and family, issued a ringing condemnation Then, in a live doorstep interview with journalists he shook off the unwanted moderate shackles again and essentially said both sides alt right and leftist demonstrators alike had erred This once again illustrated the great danger of taking Trump at face value But as Bannon said, in some areas, he is increasingly being taken over by the internal pressures There are few more insidious and successful influencers on a US President than the Generals From Lyndon Johnston to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama the Presidents have been led down paths that they didn t initially want to go After all, military men have a tendency to favor foreign intervention Trump threatened Kim Jong un s North Korea with nuclear war And then the US President did seem to pull back Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable! But still we had the unprecedented scene of a US President using language more suited to an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie about the potential use of his country s nuclear arsenal against a rogue state Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path! There has been talk of US conventional military action in North Korea, a country where they fought a war in early 1950s Most recently Trump hasrattled his sabrein Venezuala s direction In the company of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, he said: And by the way I am not going to rule out a military option, Trump said We have many options Once again there waspull backfrom the brink In this instance, it was Vice President Mike Pence who was interpreted as downplaying a possible US invasion of Venezuela Still Pence was hardly roundly dismissing action when he said: As President Trump said just a few days ago, we have many options for Venezuela  One could be critical of Trump for backtracking on another campaign promise But he has been disarminglyhonestabout his surprise at the magnitude of the job he has been elected to perform He is the only President to have been elected with no military or political experience Any man, no matter how anti interventionist, would be influenced by hawks in the military and political bureaucracy In the United States, where the policy of foreign intervention is so entrenched in the Washington ruling elite the pressure, and the intelligence that backs it, must be unbearable for a ingÃ©nue President Threats by North Korea to fire missiles at the United States, or more plausibly the US Pacific protectorate of Guam, must be taken seriously When those missiles start dropping in the ocean, the fear must be there that they will eventually hit a target The US President must be seen to protect his country s interests Similarly, Venezuela s deteriorating economic and political welfare must be considered a major problem for the United States The United States neighbors in North and South America have joined it in criticizing the government in Venezuela as it threatens to destabilize the economy of that region Venezuela has beenstrickenby violent protests in recent months amid massive inflation, food shortages, and efforts to quell dissent by the country s socialist government And never far from any US administration s strategy is the issue of oil After Canada and Saudi Arabia, Venezuela is the United States most importantsourceof imported oil The potential of a source of oil running dry would be enough for any Trump supporter to row in behind a little more foreign adventuring The thing is Trump doesn t have the public behind him To involve his country in any new foreign wars without public backing would be beyond madness His approval ratings areplummetingacross all sections of voters and now 40 percent of Americans believe he should be impeached and that was before his controversial remarks about the events in Charlottesville Trump s threats to North Korea and Venezuela are relatively new and the full effects of those declarations are yet to manifest themselves properly in polling But we do know hispoll ratingsare falling among working class blue collar workers, and, of most concern to him, in the Rust Belt of former manufacturing heartlands Gallup nightly tracking polls from January 20 through June 30 found that Trump s overall approval rating had fallen below 50 percent in 33 of the 50 states But CNN s analysis of polling shows Trump s job approval among working class whites in key States has fallen off to a level matching Mitt Romney s figures when he lost to Obama in 2012 In Wisconsin, Trump s approval among whites without a college degree now stands at 51 percent, down from 62 percent in last November s election In Pennsylvania, Trump is now at 55 percent approval with non college whites down from 64 percent These are the kind of states that formerly had huge manufacturing employment but have fallen on harder times Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Ohio, are Rust belt states that swung away from the Democrats to pull off Trump s seismic victory And they are the States that the US military traditionally recruits it solider, sailors and pilots from It is the sons and daughters of these deprived and neglected sectors of US society that have been increasingly returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan in body bags for over fifteen years And before that is was the working classes who lost most when the US ventured into the jungles of South East Asia If Trump turns away from his election promises to avoid foreign wars he will not have long in office to pursue those wars The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/400296-americans-trump-military-wars/
"14 Aug, 2017",Welcome to Charlottesville - proof that political correctness is wrecking America,"The events that just rocked Charlottesville, Virginia are symptomatic of every ailment now infecting the US political body extreme political correctness, intolerance of free speech, and a police presence that seems designed to promote violence rather than curb it Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge If ever there was a lightning rod for attracting the disciples of Liberalism and political correctness, the new creed that is destroying honest debate and discourse in the Land of the Free, you could do no worse than a bronze statue of Robert E Lee in the town square For those who never heard of the man, Lee was a very skilled general who led the South s Confederate forces against Lincoln s Union during the Civil War, the bloodiest US military conflict to date Lee also proved irresistible to the alternative right ( alt right ), an increasingly vocal group of predominantly frustrated white men who, in this latest convulsion to rattle the US, view the removal of the Southern general s statue as an appropriate metaphor for the endangered white male The Anti Defamation Leaguedefinesthe alt right as individuals who want to preserve the white majority in the US, over fears that descendants of white Europeans are losing their majority status, which will eventually result in white genocide  #Trumpcondemns display of hatred, bigotry & violence on many sides after#Charlottesvilleclasheshttps:// tdotco /EzTwN5o75Upic twitter com/V1r02egQw4 Although there is a big temptation to connect this latest bout of left right strife with the rise of Donald Trump, and the epic fall of Hillary Clinton, that explanation falls wide of the mark As witnessed by the Tea Party and other right wing movements, such as Unite the Right, Oath Keepers and the 3 Percenters, these groups were itching for a fight long before the mogul of Manhattan crashed the political scene But the left has been equally guilty of kicking up its share of dirt The great schism in American politics began shortly after the attacks of 9/11 when George W Bush initiated an opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties through the Patriot Act, a veritable tome thatfew legislatorshad a chance to read, yet signed it into law anyways This slide towards totalitarianism continued under Barack Obama, the first president tocarry outextrajudicial killings of US citizens outside of war zones, oversee a vastsurveillance networkcourtesy of the NSA, and speak openly about updating the Second Amendment right to bear firearms These constitutionally challenged moves made a lot of conservative minded folks, and certainly some Liberals, very nervous However, what seems to have really triggered the right was Obama s raft of culturally explosive legislation, which turned traditional American values on their head overnight From thelegalizationof marijuana, toendorsingsame sex marriages, toopening the door, quite literally, to transgenders using the bathroom and changing facilities of their choice, it seems Obama punched every hot button issue before leaving office At the same time, the left, well before Trump was considered hot political property, was also manning the trenches On Sept 17, 2011, a group called Occupy Wall Streettook overZuccotti Park in the heart of New York s financial district, where they held protests against economic inequality The protesters were forced to leave their site on November 15, 2011, but their message continues to resonate to this day Two years later, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African American teenager Trayvon Martin, the Black Lives Matter hashtag became a social media phenomenon The tag went from the world of virtual reality to the streets, where thousands of protesters condemned a reported rise in police brutality against blacks Finally, and very disturbingly, a group called Antifa arrived on the scene, espousing anti fascist rhetoric against far right groups This militant group, which has beendeclareda domestic terrorist organization by the New Jersey Department of Homeland Security, resorts to violent tactics that mirror the very fascist ideology it purports to be challenging At Berkeley, black masked Antifa members reportedly left behind property damage and started fires, while the group violently disrupted the March 4 Trump  event This thuggish tendency, which seems to be strangely prevalent among groups on the left, to resort to outright violence every time somebody attempts to challenge an idea sets a disastrous precedent Now, with the arrival of Donald Trump on the scene, all of this accumulated political firewood, as it were, has paved the way for round one of a conflagration that won t be resolved anytime soon In considering the violent events that shook Charlottesville, where actual fatalities and numerous injuries occurred, it is important to consider what sparked this event, and that was the decision to remove Robert E Lee s statue from the city center It seems a reasonable case could be made for both sides of the debate, yet that is exactly what is missing in America these days healthy debate First, it must be said the Confederate cause that Lee defended that is, an agrarian system based on slavery is obviously noxious and indefensible Hundreds of thousands of Africans were physically removed from their homeland and delivered to American shores, forced to till the fields of their masters from morning til night Not until the emergence of Abraham Lincoln and the North s hard fought victory in the Civil War did African Americans secure their full fledged membership in US society Thus, many Americans find it distasteful that a statue of Lee, gallantly astride his horse, sits in a park that bears his namesake Yet the question remains Will removing Lee s statue eliminate the stain of slavery from American history books? No, it won t So what is it exactly that we wish to accomplish by its removal? Should Americans be expected to tear down every physical reminder of those historical figures whose ultimate legacy was being on the wrong side of history? Should we be prepared to close down Gettysburg Military Park in Pennsylvania, for example, the sprawling site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the Civil War s bloodiest battle that precipitated the final defeat of Lee s army? It was on the basis of that victory, after all, that lent inspiration to Lincoln s famous Gettysburg Address To forget history is to repeat it is not some silly cliche, but sound advice that we ignore at our own peril The willingness to remove statues from our main squares is just one step away, I believe, from demanding history books be purged from any reference to such events for fear of offending somebody In both cases, we wish to remove the physical content because we find it morally offensive But isn t that the same thing as forgetting history? Thanks to the toxic atmosphere of political correctness that has sanitized all debate and discussion, we already see the first signs of such extreme thinking It s a sad day in America when university campuses, the very fountain of free thought, resort to violence every time a controversial guest speaker isinvitedto address a group of students So deeply entrenched are the roots of political correctness that Americans, who can barely pronounce the words male and female these days withoutfacing a lawsuit, are now willing to remove not only stone representations of dead historical figures who still have hard lessons to teach, but living, breathing individuals carrying messages that some may find unsettling, yet that have a right to be spoken nevertheless As a nation, we ve traveled light years away from the sound advice given by the English writer, Beatrice Hall, who said, I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it Police just used pepper spray on Solidarity AH protesters trying to cut through an alley between 5th and 6th Avenues and Lenora#Seattlepic twitter com/brnmQdbp54 Meanwhile, the right of assembly by all participants should have been protected by the authorities in Charlottesville since the idea of allowing these two groups, which exist at extreme ends on the political spectrum, to mingle in the proximity of tiny Emancipation Park (formerly called Lee Park ) was simply insane It is important to note that Unite the Right (UtR) hadsecuredthe necessary permits to assemble at the park to hear various speakers discuss the decision to remove the historical Lee statue They also had the blessing of the American Civil Liberties Union (Yet this did not stop Unite The Right organizer Jason Kessler from beingattackedby protesters while attempting to hold a news conference) This decision naturally led to counter groups, notably from Antifa, to also secure permits to hold counter rallies Thus, this quaint Virginia town had collected together enough combustible material to have given the authorities enough incentive to ensure public safety, yet once again the police failed spectacularly on that point Reminiscent of the violence that left Berkeley campus resembling a war zone over a scheduled talk by Milo Yiannopoulos, a British commentator associated with the so called alt right, the Charlottesville police fueled the tension by driving the conflicting sides into something resembling a mosh pit Indeed, by all outside appearances, it looked as if the police were willfully inciting violence between the leftist and rightist camps How many people even know about this story?https:// tdotco /bhngAoAD7V Are the local police forces really so inept as to force two opposing groups together during a protest? According to variousaccountsI have heard, that is exactly what happened While I will leave the question of police measures to other commentators, it needs to be emphasized that if Americans are to retain their constitutionally protected freedom of speech and assembly, then the authorities must be expected to create the safe spaces for such events When Americans are being physically denied the right to express themselves due to an oppressive atmosphere of political correctness, then the authorities must take the necessary steps to protect them, otherwise the natural result will be more violence It s sad that the national state of debate in America has reached the point when such measures are required, but without open discussion on all issues, America will be stuck in a Civil War mindset @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/399585-charlottesville-america-trump-violence/

when it s coming Well, now we do know and there s nothing to be done about it  He says he will be dead by September It will take about a week to die, though no one can be sure Animals live the

contaminated and lifeless now A curtain of radioactivity is moving south towards Australia and New Zealand, southern Africa and South America By September, the last cities, towns and villages will

European companies that do legitimate business with Russia In what passed for debate on Capitol Hill, the more garrulous senators left no doubt that the embargo was designed to force Europe to import expensive American gas Their main aim seems to be war real war No provocation as extreme can suggest anything else They seem to crave it, even though Americans have little idea what war is The Civil War of 1861 5 was the last on their mainland War is what the United States does to others The only nation to have used nuclear weapons against human beings, they have since destroyed scores of governments, many of them democracies, and laid to waste whole societies the million deaths in Iraq were a fraction of the carnage in Indo China, which President Reagan called a noble cause and President Obama revised as the tragedy of an exceptional people He was not referring to the Vietnamese Filming last year at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, I overheard a National Parks Service guide lecturing a school party of young teenagers Listen up, he said We lost 58,000 young soldiers in Vietnam, and they died defending your freedom  At a stroke, the truth was inverted No freedom was defended Freedom was destroyed A peasant country was invaded and millions of its people were killed, maimed, dispossessed, poisoned; 60,000 of the invaders took their own lives Listen up, indeed A lobotomy is performed on each generation Facts are removed History is excised and replaced by what Time magazine calls an eternal present Harold Pinter described this as manipulation of power worldwide, while masquerading as a force for universal good, a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of hypnosis [which meant] that it never happened Nothing ever happened Even while it was happening it wasn t happening It didn t matter It was of no interest  Those who call themselves liberals or tendentiously the left are eager participants in this manipulation, and its brainwashing, which today revert to one name: Trump Trump is mad, a fascist, a dupe of Russia He is also a gift for liberal brains pickled in the formaldehyde of identity politics, wrote Luciana Bohne memorably The obsession with Trump the man not Trump as a symptom and caricature of an enduring system beckons great danger for all of us While they pursue their fossilized anti Russia agendas, narcissistic media such as the Washington Post, the BBC and the Guardian suppress the essence of the most important political story of our time as they warmonger on a scale I cannot remember in my lifetime On 3 August, in contrast to the acreage the Guardian has given to drivel that the Russians conspired with Trump (reminiscent of the far right smearing of John Kennedy as a Soviet agent ), the paper buried, on page 16, news that the President of the United States was forced to sign a Congressional bill declaring economic war on Russia Unlike every other Trump signing, this was conducted in virtual secrecy and attached with a caveat from Trump himself that it was clearly unconstitutional  A coup against the man in the White House is under way This is not because he is an odious human being, but because he has consistently made clear he does not want war with Russia This glimpse of sanity, or simple pragmatism, is anathema to the national security managers who guard a system based on war, surveillance, armaments, threats and extreme capitalism Martin Luther King called them the greatest purveyors of violence in the world today  They have encircled Russia and China with missiles and a nuclear arsenal They have used neo Nazis to install an unstable, aggressive regime on Russia s borderland  the way through which Hitler invaded, causing the deaths of 27 million people Their goal is to dismember the modern Russian Federation In response, partnership is a word used incessantly by Vladimir Putin anything, it seems, that might halt an evangelical drive to war in the United States Incredulity in Russia may have now turned to fear and perhaps a certain resolution The Russians almost certainly have war gamed nuclear counter strikes Air raid drills are not uncommon Their history tells them to get ready The threat is simultaneous Russia is first, China is next The US has just completed a huge military exercise with Australia known as Talisman Sabre They rehearsed a blockade of the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea, through which pass China s economic lifelines The admiral commanding the US Pacific fleet said that, if required, he would nuke China That he would say such a thing publicly in the current perfidious atmosphere begins to make fact of Nevil Shute s fiction None of this is considered news No connection is made as the bloodfest of Passchendaele a century ago is remembered Honest reporting is no longer welcome in much of the media Windbags, known as pundits, dominate: editors are infotainment or party line managers Where there was once sub editing, there is the liberation of axe grinding clichÃ©s Those journalists who do not comply are defenestrated The urgency has plenty of precedents In my film, The Coming War on China, John Bordne, a member of a US Air Force missile combat crew based in Okinawa, Japan, describes how in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis he and his colleagues were told to launch all the missiles from their silos Nuclear armed, the missiles were aimed at both China and Russia A junior officer questioned this, and the order was eventually rescinded but only after they were issued with service revolvers and ordered to shoot at others in a missile crew if they did not stand down  At the height of the Cold War, the anti communist hysteria in the United States was such that US officials who were on official business in China were accused of treason and sacked In 1957 the year Shute wrote On the Beach no official in the State Department could speak the language of the world s most populous nation Mandarin speakers were purged under strictures now echoed in the Congressional bill that has just passed, aimed at Russia The bill was bipartisan There is no fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans The terms left and right are meaningless Most of America s modern wars were started not by conservatives, but by liberal Democrats When Obama left office, he presided over a record seven wars, including America s longest war and an unprecedented campaign of extrajudicial killings murder by drones In his last year, according to a Council on Foreign Relations study, Obama, the reluctant liberal warrior, dropped 26,171 bombs three bombs every hour, 24 hours a day Having pledged to help rid the world of nuclear weapons, the Nobel Peace Laureate built more nuclear warheads than any president since the Cold War Trump is a wimp by comparison It was Obama with his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, at his side who destroyed Libya as a modern state and launched the human stampede to Europe At home, immigration groups knew him as the deporter in chief  One of Obama s last acts as president was to sign a bill that handed a record $618 billion to the Pentagon, reflecting the soaring ascendancy of fascist militarism in the governance of the United States Trump has endorsed this Buried in the detail was the establishment of a Center

"7 Jul, 2017","âUnless G20 Summit is held on a deserted island, there will be protestsâ","It is not so much the case where these economic summits are being held, it is the fact that increasingly the powers that be are no longer able to rule in the old way, political commentator and writer John Wight told RT Violence broke out on the streets of Hamburg during a mass demonstration against the G20 summit on Thursday Police deployed water cannon and tear gas against protesters who hurled bottles and reportedly refused to remove their masks RT:Do you think questions should be asked about holding the G20 Summit in Hamburg at all, given the logistics and layout and size of the city? John Wight:Unless you hold these events somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic on a deserted island then these protests are going to take place It is not so much the case where they are being held, it is the fact that increasingly the powers that be are no longer able to rule in the old way and people are not willing to be ruled in the old way And they have a point when you consider the disaster that is taking place both within a global economy and ensuing untenable and exponential levels of inequality Not only within states but also between states, you have the issue of climate change You have a growing crisis on the Korean peninsula, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South and East China seas This is a growing crisis These scenes are the norm and unless these world leaders are willing to meet on a desert island in the middle of nowhere, then these [protests] are going to be happening increasingly, unless there is a serious structural change I think it was a deliberate decision because everybody knows that Hamburg has a community of young radicals that are ready to resort to violence And also everybody in Germany knows that the police of Hamburg have a record of a lot of violence and rudeness against protesters themselves This was a riot that was bound to happen I think it was a very deliberate decision Angela Merkel could have held the meeting in a castle somewhere in Bavaria or on some island of the coast of Germany, and they wouldn t have had to deploy [thousands of] police This whole thing is a show of force Everybody is reporting on these violent clashes, but everybody is forgetting that there were 12,000 peaceful protesters and these peaceful protesters are being thrown into one bag with a few violent young radicals The government is trying to tell the people that if you protest against us or the system, you are going to be associated with violence and radicalism  Ernst Wolff, journalist and author RT:Do you think the authorities were correct to respond in that way? JW:It is inflaming things but authorities are between a rock and a hard place because of the threat of terrorism, a very real threat Obviously, we ve had an increasing spate of terrorist attacks throughout Western Europe, so they are mindful of the possibility of something of that order After all, we are talking about world leaders So obviously there is going to be a heavy security presence Questions will obviously be asked, but I think ultimately it is due to a status quo that more and more people are growing angry about, given the levels if inequality, the march to war, the tensions all over the world And this is all fitting into this growing ocean of anti politics And it is this anti politics that fed Brexit, fed the election of Donald Trump, and so forth This is now the rule rather than an exception And if the authorities want to forestall these scenes, then they have to do something about their own role in creating the conditions in which these protests are emerging RT:Both the protesters and police were ready for violence What is your impression about what is happening in Hamburg? Dr Rainer Rothfuss, geopolitical analyst and consultant:For me this is a clear sign of disintegration of European societies If you see such a form of taking the rights of democracy, as the protesters claim, to the streets Of course, these are mostly peaceful protesters; roughly 1,000 among the 12,000 who have the tendency to become violent or to cover up their faces But the scenes in the streets and which you could also see at former incidents, like the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm in 2007, and two years ago in Frankfurt when the European Central Bank opened its doors, it really gives you the impression that society is heavily under tension And I ask myself, How will the media blame Russia for this? because they claim [Russia] is attempting to disintegrate European society No! It is internal problems, it is a confrontation between left wing representatives who don t believe any longer in the system that it really pursues the interests of normal, less favored people in the society It is becoming like a culture of a violent protests And I think it is a dangerous development READ MORE: Putin and Trump shake hands ahead of first face to face meeting at G20 (VIDEO) RT:The focus in the US and Russia is largely on Donald Trump meeting President Putin How do you see that going? Janice Atkinson, independent British European Parliament member:It is the only game in town, it is the only story in town The two most powerful men in the world are going to be talking and they are going to be talking about the threat of Western civilization as Trump was talking about in Poland High on their priority is going to be the defeat of ISIS, because that is our common enemy The defeat of terrorism and security threats, the security is linked to the nation states, taking back the control of our borders, stopping the flow of migration out of Africa and the Middle East and trying to get to grips with the Middle East That is what they should be talking about Forget the Paris Climate Change agreement, let the Europeans and the others warble on about that That s is not the greatest threat we face at the moment Let s hope something positive will come out of it But a word of caution: President Trump comes facing hostile atmosphere back home in America, hostile atmosphere apart from Britain most of the European Union leaders are hostile to him We have seen a thawing of relations with the French president, who extended an invitation to him for Bastille Day In general, he will need to appear to be tough so will probably will make some lip service, tough talk against Russia He will have to do that for the domestic audience and to get some brownie points in Europe, in general Adel Darwish, journalist and co author of Water Wars: Coming Conflicts RT:Vladimir Putin has worked with previous US leaders: Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton How likely is a working relationship with the current US leader?

"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civil society, limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ If you were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The Open Society Institute (OSI) and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the European Union, going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use âall the tools at its disposalâ to âsweep outâ NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which âserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments â But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization âTV Novostiâ, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/
"17 Jan, 2017",The issue is not Trump. It is us.,"On the day President Trump is inaugurated, thousands of writers in the United States will express their indignation In order for us to heal and move forward , say Writers Resist, we wish to bypass direct political discourse, in favour of an inspired focus on the future, and how we, as writers, can be a unifying force for the protection of democracy And: We urge local organizers and speakers to avoid using the names of politicians or adopting anti language as the focus for their Writers Resist event It s important to ensure that nonprofit organizations, which are prohibited from political campaigning, will feel confident participating in and sponsoring these events Thus, real protest is to be avoided, for it is not tax exempt Compare  such drivel with  the declarations of the Congress of American Writers, held at Carnegie Hall, New York, in 1935, and again two years later They were electric events, with writers discussing how they could confront ominous events in Abyssinia, China and Spain Telegrams from Thomas Mann, C Day Lewis, Upton Sinclair and Albert Einstein were read out, reflecting the fear that great power was now rampant and that it had become impossible to discuss art and literature without politics or, indeed, direct political action Protests & gay dance party planned to sabotage Trump inaugurationhttps:// tdotco /2aoCAfJ1az A writer, the journalist Martha Gellhorn told the second congress, must be a man of action now A man who has given a year of his life to steel strikes, or to the unemployed, or to the problems of racial prejudice, has not lost or wasted time He is a man who has known where he belonged If you should survive such action, what you have to say about it afterwards is the truth, is necessary and real, and it will last Her words echo across the unction and violence of the Obama era and the silence of those who colluded with his deceptions That the menace of rapacious power rampant long before the rise of Trump  has been accepted by writers, many of them privileged and celebrated, and by those who guard the gates of literary criticism, and culture, including popular culture, is uncontroversial Not for them the impossibility of writing and promoting literature bereft of politics Not for them the responsibility to speak out, regardless of who occupies the White House Today, false symbolism is all Identity is all In 2016, Hillary Clinton stigmatised millions of voters as a basket of deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic you name it Her abuse was handed out at an LGBT rally as part of her cynical campaign to win over minorities by abusing a white mostly working class majority Divide and rule, this is called; or identity politics in which race and gender conceal class, and allow the waging of class war  Trump understood this When the truth is replaced by silence, said the Soviet dissident poet Yevtushenko, the silence is a lie Obama HOPE artist creates Trump protest posters for inaugurationhttps:// tdotco /ExvesmbBzNpic twitter com/qi1sS8qInZ This is not an American phenomenon A  few years ago, Terry Eagleton, then professor of English literature at Manchester University, reckoned that for the first time in two centuries, there is no eminent British poet, playwright or novelist prepared to question the foundations of the western way of life No Shelley speaks for the poor, no Blake for utopian dreams, no Byron damns the corruption of the ruling class, no Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin reveal the moral disaster of capitalism William Morris, Oscar Wilde, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw have no equivalents today Harold Pinter was the last to raise his voice Among today s insistent voices of consumer feminism, none echoes Virginia Woolf, who described the arts of dominating other people of ruling, of killing, of acquiring land and capital There is something both venal and profoundly stupid about famous writers as they venture outside their cosseted world and embrace an issue Across the Review section of theGuardianon 10 December was a dreamy picture of Barack Obama looking up to the heavens and the words, Amazing Grace and Farewell the Chief The sycophancy ran like a polluted babbling brook through page after page He was a vulnerable figure in many ways But the grace The all encompassing grace: in manner and form, in argument and intellect, with humour and cool [He] is a blazing tribute to what has been, and what can be again He seems ready to keep fighting, and remains a formidable champion to have on our side The grace the almost surreal levels of grace I have conflated these quotes There are others even more hagiographic and bereft of mitigation The Guardian s chief apologist for Obama, Gary Younge, has always been careful to mitigate, to say that his hero could have done more : oh, but there were the calm, measured and consensual solutions #Trumpcalls CIA chief fake news leaker after Brennan warns him about talking & tweetinghttps:// tdotco /0SqNm96IJI None of them, however, could surpass the American writer, Ta Nehisi Coates, the recipient of a genius grant worth $625,000 from a liberal foundation In an interminable essay forTheAtlanticentitled, My President Was Black , Coates brought new meaning to prostration The final chapter , entitled When You Left, You Took All of Me With You , a line from a Marvin Gaye song, describes seeing the Obamas rising out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity   The Ascension, no less One of the persistent strands in American political life is a cultish extremism that approaches fascism This was given expression and  reinforced during the two terms of Barack Obama I believe in American exceptionalism with every fibre of my being, said Obama, who expanded America s favourite military pastime, bombing, and death squads ( special operations ) as no other president has done since the Cold War According to a Council on Foreign Relations survey, in 2016 alone Obama dropped 26,171 bombs That is 72 bombs every day He bombed the poorest people on earth, in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan Where was Meryl Streep when Obama was prosecuting whistleblowers & bombing weddings?

the most important weapons Take the catastrophe in Libya In 2011, Obama said  Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi was planning genocide against his own people We knew that if we waited one more day,

The Red Cross identified mass graves, and Unicef reported that most [of the children killed] were under the age of ten Under Obama, the US has extended secret special forces operations to 138 countries, or 70 per cent of the world s population The first African American president launched what amounted to a full scale invasion of Africa Reminiscent of the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century, the US African Command (Africom) has built a network of supplicants among collaborative African regimes eager for American bribes and armaments   Africom s soldier to soldier doctrine embeds US officers at every level of command from general to warrant officer Only pith helmets are missing It is as if Africa s proud history of liberation, from Patrice Lumumba to Nelson Mandela, is consigned to oblivion by a new master s black colonial elite whose historic mission , warned Frantz Fanon half a century ago, is the promotion of a capitalism rampant though camouflaged It was Obama who, in 2011, announced what became known as the pivot to Asia , in which almost two thirds of US naval forces would be transferred to the Asia Pacific to confront China , in the words of his Defence Secretary There was no threat from China; the entire enterprise was unnecessary It was an extreme provocation to keep the Pentagon and its demented brass happy In 2014, the Obama s administration oversaw and paid for a fascist led coup in Ukraine against the democratically elected government, threatening Russia in the western borderland through Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, with a loss of 27 million lives It was Obama who placed missiles in Eastern Europe aimed at Russia, and it was the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who increased spending on nuclear warheads to a level higher than

retained their independence during the years of intellectual dog whistling since 9/11, wrote this last week: President Barack Obama may have done more than anyone to assure [Donald] Trump s victory While Trump s election has triggered a rapid expansion of fascist currents in US civil society, a fascist outcome for the political system is far from inevitable But that fight back requires clarity as to how we got to such a dangerous precipice The seeds of 21st century fascism were planted, fertilized and watered by the Obama administration and the politically bankrupt liberal elite Robinson points out that whether in its 20th or its emerging 21st century variants, fascism is, above all, a response to deep structural crises of capitalism, such as that of the 1930s and the one that began with the financial meltdown in 2008 There is a near straight line here from Obama to Trump The liberal elite s refusal to challenge the rapaciousness of transnational capital and its brand of identity politics served to eclipse the language of the working and popular classes pushing white workers into an identity of white nationalism and helping the neo fascists to organise them The seedbed is Obama s Weimar Republic, a landscape of endemic poverty, militarised police and barbaric prisons: the consequence of a market extremism which, under his presidency, prompted the transfer of $14 trillion in public money to criminal enterprises in Wall Street Perhaps his greatest legacy is the co option and disorientation of any real opposition Bernie Sanders specious revolution does not apply

the US has openly intervened have made the world s most self important journalists laughing stocks In the country with constitutionally the freest press in the world, free journalism now exists only

centre to the lunar right The left are homeless renegades Martha Gellhorn described as a rare and wholly admirable fraternity She excluded those who confuse politics with a fixation on their navels

"2 Dec, 2016",We must choose between Assad and Islamists in Syria â Marion Le Pen,"Non establishment politicians are on the march with Donald Trump winning the election in America, many are predicting similar shocks across the Atlantic In France, the presidential vote is just months away and the country s right wing National Front party is polling strongly As the country struggles with a refugee crisis and the threat of terrorism, can a force like the National Front offer answers? Does its leader, Marine Le Pen, have a real shot at securing the presidency? And how would that transform Europe? We ask France s youngest MP and National Front member Marion Marechal Le Pen Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Marion Marechal Le Pen, welcome to our programme Marion Le Pen:Hello! SS:We ve wanted to interview you for quite some time    and finally we have the pleasure After Donald trump s victory in the presidential election, French President Francois Hollande said that this   opens a period of uncertainty   in the world What did he mean by that? MLP:I think this isn t the first and, unfortunately, not the last time our president Francois Hollande has made a serious diplomatic mistake I think it shows that he couldn t keep his political disappointment under control As you know, he openly supported Hillary Clinton in her run for presidency, just like he always supported her militaristic foreign policy, a policy of intervening in other country s internal affairs, especially in the Middle East It is indeed a big mistake and I do hope that the president of France can still find a way to maintain dialogue with the new president of the United States, in order to create a truly multipolar world SS:As far as I know, you received an invitation to work together from Steve Bannon, Trump s chief strategist? MLP:I received a friendly message from him via social networks, and I responded to that But there hasn t been any direct exchange so far SS:So you don t really know what this invitation entails specifically? MLP:Oh no, I don t It was more of an informal message SS:Representatives of almost all French political forces took a stand against Trump during the presidential race so how are they going to talk to him now, work with him? MLP:That s a good question Although, it is just the same as when the entire political establishment and all mass media were against Brexit and in support of Britain s staying in the EU and that was because in reality they didn t want to take notice of the public protests that were breaking out all the time across Europe and now in the United States, which in the end proves the inefficiency of their policies I don t think they are up to the task of finding a common language with the new powers That s why there is a need to foster a new political establishment both in France and in other countries This new establishment has to offer Europe a new political project and new ways of economic cooperation with the United States and, naturally, with Russia as well SS:You mentioned many times that France needs to pursue a policy independent from the United States Does that mean that right now, French policy is under Washington s influence? Does the U S have a direct influence on certain issues or certain actions? If so, what are they? MLP:Not quite so I think we need to mention two things here The first one is that a lot of issues are decided by the European Commission and I d like to remind here that Commissioners are appointed, not elected, and therefore it cannot be considered a truly democratic organisation This was clearly seen in the case of Ukraine All actions were driven by the European Commission while French diplomacy was completely powerless The problem is that the European Union is comprised of 28 nations soon to be 27 which means that each nation has its own ideas about Russia and its own interests related to Russia and so there is no uniform or clear policy In any case, there is definitely certain American influence in play here Another thing to mention is NATO Unfortunately, France renewed cooperation with NATO, which, as it is well known, sees its goal in expanding its presence towards the borders of the former USSR For Russia, it is a certain kind of provocation and an act of aggression And France here is both a victim and accessory to this expansion policy that creates tension in relations with Russia due to the fact that NATO in many regards caters to the American political interests SS:We re going to get back to NATO in just a moment Before that I d like to ask Do you think Trump s election might help France acquire a more independent stand in its domestic policy? MLP:What mattered to us at theFront Nationalabout Trump s presidential campaign was the kind of foreign policy messages he was sending; he expressed desire to work with president Putin; to review the policy that has been pursued until now in the Middle East; he also criticised harshly what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan and today s situation in Syria That s why I think that with Trump in power we ll have an opportunity to change our attitude towards the multipolar world, in which Russia will also have an influence   As far as I could tell, he was also critical of NATO, his view being that it overburdens the American budget I hope that we ll have a chance to balance out this military alliance and that France will be able to regain partially its independence SS:Indeed, Trump criticised NATO and mentioned that America needs to revise its relationship with NATO He believes that Europe is not investing enough in the alliance Do you think France should invest more in NATO? MLP:In any case, we need to strive to have as much influence as possible over NATO Sadly, until now the French government in its entirety both the right wing and left wing forces have only followed the U S and NATO s interests I m referring here to the new expansion policy and the current missile defence strategy that creates tensions in relations with Russia But the key thing for France to do would be to resume investing in its own military budget in order to get more room for maneuvering and to acquire a higher degree of independence SS:The President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker said that building a common military force in Europe is inevitable Could this force become an alternative to NATO? MLP:I don t think so and I wouldn t want it And there s a simple reason for that Of course, we can run military cooperation programs with some countries and exchange some information in case of shared interests, but at the same time, we need to maintain the sovereignty of our states So even with the European common military force on the agenda we should not forget that in contrast to the EU and the EU Commission, each and every European state has its own idea of the world order and their own, often different interests Russia is a good example: we can see today that Greece, Bulgaria, Poland and France can have absolutely different relations with Russia That s the kind of difficulties we can run into Right now, France has some special interests related to its status of an old colonial power we have a kind of a unique experience in a way, some special relations with a number of African states If we had a common European military force in place, we wouldn t have been able to intervene in Mali, which we did to support the president of Mali in his combat against Islamists A common European military force would only make us impotent and inefficient SS:No one believed in Brexit and almost no one thought Trump could win Can the Front National win the election in France? MLP:It is definitely a good sign, and it gives us hope Both Brexit and Trump s win tell us that you can win even when the entire political system and all mass media are against one candidate, and even when the financial establishment and the cultural elite are vouching for that candidate s opponent I hope that psychologically it will have a positive effect on our voters SS:Who do you consider to be your strongest opponent? MLP:Our strongest opponent in France? They are all at about the same level The interesting thing is that in France the divide between the left and the right wings is more of an illusion Because when it comes to major issues their policies are identical Both camps supported mass immigration, promoted multiculturalism, complied with U S policies, defended European federalism and gave up our sovereignty The so called opponents presented a united front on all these issues The real divide is between those who defend national sovereignty and identity and those who support globalism, NATO, eurocentrism SS:I ve noticed that the difference between left wing and right wing parties is becoming less significant in other countries too not just in France It is happening all over Europe MLP:You are absolutely right, this is not just about France SS:Your political opponents often use your slogans and ideas Are you concerned that they might steal some of your voters? MLP:They have tried it before, especially the right wing politicians from Sarkozy s camp, borrowing our assessments, predictions, and solutions They did it in 2007 and unfortunately succeeded In the end they came into power but failed: they raised taxes and national debt, got involved in complicated military operations internationally which led to disasters I am talking about Nicolas Sarkozy and his Libyan campaign that caused a terrible migrant crisis I don t think the French people have forgotten about that And it gives the National Front more power allowing us to become a real alternative SS:We know that the National Front supports the Frexit idea France leaving the EU, you even say it is necessary What kind of plan does your party propose for it? MLP:We disagree with the European system and want to leave the EU because we don t think the system can be reformed All the conditions and agreements create obstacles for reform If we want to go back to the beginning, to the foundation of this European system free travel, free movement of capital and goods we need all European countries to be like minded Today it is impossible If we come into power our goal will be to discuss a special status for France with the European Commission, something similar to what the UK has, but it will be more detailed, which will allow us to restore our financial and economic sovereignty as well as solve the migrant crisis If we are not granted this status we will ask the people of France to vote on leaving the EU at a referendum But we are not saying no to building a different Europe based on the principles of national sovereignty and cooperation through joint European projects SS:You often criticise French and European policies regarding refugees The Jungle  refugee camp in Calais was recently dismantled What do you propose doing? MLP:The French people are being lied to, they are under the impression that all the illegal migrants arriving in our country come from Syria That is a lie Most of those illegal migrants are economic migrants coming from North Africa, not Syria They pretend to be refugees We want to restore our border control right now we have none since we are a Schengen country That s why we suffer from this illegal migration French social policies create very attractive conditions for immigrants both legal and illegal A person arrives in our country illegally and has the right to receive the best medical care which French citizens can t afford This is ridiculously unfair So the authorities need to revoke this policy and stop lying to the people Of course we cannot say no to granting asylum in general, but we need strict guidelines offering benefits only to real political refugees, not everyone We just can t afford it SS:A wave of terrorist attacks shook France over the past year This was a tragedy for me also I ve lived in Paris Why is this happening in France? MLP:Because Islamic State considers France a godless  country We sometimes don t take religion seriously, we are a secular state, and it offends some radical Muslims This made us a target But also don t forget that today France is the main source of recruitment for jihadists and ISIL, because our migration policy has been absolutely reckless in the last 40 years There are isolated communities in different parts of our country which have allowed radical Islam to spread Unfortunately young Muslim immigrants are perfect candidates for Islamic State The number of jihadists in France keeps growing SS:But the major concern is the fact that most of the terrorists behind those attacks were regular French citizens They were born and raised in Paris MLP:Not necessarily, there are two types of jihadists They could be foreigners, like in the Bataclan, embedded in the migrant community these people got into the Schengen zone and France illegally hiding behind the refugee status But there were also French citizens among the terrorists The tragedy of our country is that there are a huge number of such immigrants living on our territory they maintain their culture and traditions, follow their customs and do not integrate into French society More than that, they often impose their culture on us We see how radical Islam thrives in these closed communities supported by foreign states such as Qatar or Saudi Arabia that are very active in France We have to revise the migration and integration policies because they don t work they hurt our social sector and compromise the security of our country SS:What is the solution? I understand that you think it is not just a security threat ¦ MLP:Like I said we need to introduce several restrictions The issue of citizenship is very important There are many people who became French citizens only because we were very tolerant in that respect, the same goes for automatically becoming a citizen if you were born in France It s insane And we have to introduce strict guidelines for the naturalisation process The current socialist government is just as gracious as the Sarkozy government was, when it comes to granting French citizenship I will say it again we need to revoke social policies that welcome immigrants and protect the native culture of our land A   multicultural society is an utopia, we need to forget about it and stop complying with political demands ¦ SS:What should be done in that respect? MLP:We can say that radical Islam is thriving in France because our state was too weak We met so many demands, such as halal meals or separate pool sessions for men and women We have also been spineless about enforcing the ban on face covering So these Islamist cells feel very comfortable, become vengeful and aggressive And all because France did not have the will to promote its own values and culture SS:Some say that the situation may deteriorate if France begins to impose its culture If a woman is not allowed to cover her face or swim separately in the pool this may provoke anger What do you think? MLP:This argument suggests that giving up is the only alternative here I disagree, because we never even tried to put our foot down Our only strategy has been systematic concessions when under the pressure of political demands we allowed a foreign culture to invade and develop in our country This was done in the name of respecting people s rights, when France was not allowed to impose its cultural values on new migrants Decades of this spineless policy has led to the current security problems, terrorism and radical Islam claiming new ground People who propose this argument basically admit that they have already lost In the current situation it makes sense to propose a different approach SS:Do you think there could be some sort of a middle ground here? Or it s down to choosing between two different political strategies? MLP:You are either weak or strong, you can t be both at the same time   At theFront Nationalwe stick to an old proverb: when in Rome, do as the Romans do,  so when in France one has to respect French traditions This does not mean that a foreign, non European origin would prevent anyone from becoming a French citizen, but there are certain strict requirements to be met At the very least these need to include abiding by French law which often, sadly, doesn t happen in the present day reality But not only that, one should also agree to become part of French culture which in fact means giving up partially one s cultural background in order to become a fully fledged  French national This doesn t happen today either And I think that French people are suffering from being unable to feel at home in their own country, as if they were now only one of a multitude of different cultural communities This creates tensions, especially within the younger generation And this is what this false humanism and tolerance policy is about: creating a situation that is incredibly tense and dangerous for all involved under the pretext of tolerance SS:France responded to the terrorist attacks by bombing ISIL in Syria Should France continue its active involvement in this campaign? MLP:I think France s decision to join the international coalition was the right one I would like to see as many countries as possible, especially European ones, upholding the need to participate in the war on Islamic State, because the latter is a serious threat to all of us I think it was also right because French politics is, sadly, partially responsible for the present situation TheFront Nationaltalked about it during the Afghanistan and Libya campaigns when France was supplying weapons to the Islamists opposing Gaddafi and at first, they wanted to do the same in Syria by giving arms to the Syrian opposition fighting Assad That policy was so inconsistent that our French soldiers fighting Islamists in Mali, on our president s orders, found those Islamists fighting back with the French weapons supplied to them by the other countries opposition groups we were supporting It is time to acknowledge these mistakes and make peace with the fact that the only choice in today s Syria is between Bashar Assad and Islamists because as sad as it is, there is no one else there If we really care about France s interests, we must realise that Islamists pose a real threat to our security, while Bashar Assad does not Today is the time to be pragmatic and to think logically until the end SS:And why do French diplomats just keep refusing to talk with Bashar Assad? You referred to Libya as an example We all can see now it s been torn apart by civil war, and there is no end to it France is also responsible, as it participated in overthrowing Gaddafi MLP:It s difficult to say I am not aware of the French government s hidden motives I can only say there were many amateur decisions made   And now we are actively supporting Sunnis and closely collaborating with Qatar and Saudi Arabia This upsets our once balanced foreign policy that we had for a long time there were times when we even protected Christians in the Middle East Add to that American influence on the European Commission and NATO All these factors put together resulted in the French government s growing political shortsightedness and errors that need to be fixed SS:You describe France s policy for Russia as absurd  You also supported the resolution by the National Assembly to lift anti Russian sanctions Why did this resolution have no effect on the government? MLP:Yes, that was amazing It s up to the president to determine the foreign policy in France The National Assembly can only recommend; its position is not final   As a result, we once again ended up following in the footsteps of U S diplomacy Like we said from the very beginning, and like we still believe, these sanctions weren t just inefficient, because they did not force Russia to make any concessions; on the contrary, they were merely an irritant, because Russia became even more adamant Russia suffers from sanctions much less than Europe, especially France, because Russian counter sanctions hit us really hard This is a clear example of how our politicians fail to take care of our interests As a result, we have a disastrous situation in our agriculture And it s not just France that suffered economically because of these sanctions Major joint projects by France and Russia were frozen because of the European and American sanctions Big French companies operating in Russia are now in a difficult situation This did not benefit us diplomatically either It s time we stop using the same measures again and again, now that we know they don t work SS:European politicians have criticised Trump s intention to normalise relations with Russia; London according to The Telegraph is trying to make him reconsider; Federica Mogherini Brussels top diplomat says the EU will under no circumstances give up its policy of confrontation with Russia Why, do you think, they re doing all that? MLP:The United Kingdom pursues its peculiar policy They have a special relationship with the United States This is due to historic reasons and the fact that it s an island nation Britain is currently getting ready to withdraw from the EU Perhaps even, this will somehow help us make our relations with Russia more balanced; at least I hope so It s important to realise that this certainly doesn t reflect people s will Donald Trump s victory is a vivid illustration of that It s true that most people in France don t support France s policies today We realise that Russia is part of the European world and European culture We can never forget that we were allies in World War I and World War II We remember all that I strongly believe that a new generation of leaders will soon make their way into government positions, because people want peace We are tired of living the old way; it s an old concept of the Cold war which runs contrary to the interests of the people SS:Your party leader Marine Le Pen called President Hollande Merkel s Vice Chancellor  MLP:Yes, that s true Today we often see that Angela Merkel rules over Europe and that Germany takes the initiative in making all important decisions SS:What should be done to eliminate this imbalance? MLP:We should question the efficiency of the European system It s clear now that the European Union and the euro as the EU currency were created to serve the interests of Germany They took advantage of the opportunities better than we did, because the European currency was based on the German currency Consequently, the German economy adapted to the euro perfectly and this benefited Germany But the European currency is not adapted to the French economy because it s too stable, so our country is not competitive in the international markets export wise This caused huge problems in our agricultural and industrial sectors I can t help but doubt the usefulness of the European system SS:Thank you so much for the interview! We wish you good luck with everything! MLP:Thank you!

"7 Nov, 2016","People angry, anarchic levels of violence possible after vote â Chris Hedges","The end to the dirtiest presidential race in American history is just around the corner Candidates marred by scandals and allegations of corruption are running neck and neck The nation is divided and tensions are running high, as both Trump and Hillary head into the vote with historically low approval ratings With both candidates loathed by the public, who is going to be the real loser in this race? And with the price tag for the campaign set to exceed a record $6 6 billion dollars, why does the cost of the American elections amount to the budget of a small country? We ask American journalist, Pulitzer prize winning author Chris Hedges Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Chris Hedges, Pulitzer prize winning journalist, author, welcome to the show once again, great to have you back Hillary was seemingly cruising to victory just after the debates some polls gave her a 10 point lead and now there s virtually nothing separating the candidates Today, if you had a million bucks who d you bet it on Clinton or Trump? Chris Hedges:It s impossible to tell you, because it really will depend on the mood, on the emotions of the voters on election day That s all these campaigns are about, because they both essentially are neo liberal candidates who will do nothing to impede imperial expansion and corporate power The whole campaign has descended to, you know, not surprisingly, to the level of a reality TV show, with presidential debates featuring women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault being brought in by Donald Trump; videos I ll go back to the primaries of the size of people s genitals I mean, it s just appalling, but all of that is emblematic of a political system in deep decay and one that no longer revolves around fundamental issues We know from the Wikileaks emails, the John Podesta emails that were leaked from Hillary Clinton, that there was a calculated effort on a part of a Clinton campaign to promote these fringe candidates like Trump, and they particularly wanted Trump, because the difference between Hillary Clinton and a more mainstream Republican candidate, like Jeb Bush, is so marginal So if you had to ask me, I don t think Trump will win, but I don t rule out the possibility that he will win we have to look at the Brexit polls in Britain SS:Right CH: And same kind of anger is underway here SS:The FBI is extending its investigation into the Clinton email case after obtaining a warrant to search the laptop of Clinton s closest aide Huma Abedin The Clinton campaign says the move is political is the FBI guilty of swaying the vote, like Hillary suggests? CH:To be fair to FBI, they were put in a very difficult position there are tens of thousands, they say 660,000 emails, we don t really know how many of those, but if the FBI made this discovery and did not make it public, they would be accused, of course, of aiding Clinton campaign I don t know the motives, but I think we do have to recognise that the FBI, I think, felt correctly, that given the volatility of the campaign and the fact that they had, after the investigation of the Clinton email she had used a private server while they certainly felt that it was inappropriate to exonerate her of criminal activity that they felt kind of a responsibility to be transparent SS:Another FBI investigation showed that the bureau didn t find any evidence that Trump is tied to the Kremlin, like the Clinton campaign implied has Hillary s attempt to play the Russian card failed? CH:I don t know that it s failed, because the media has been quite obsequious in terms of parroting back this narrative, and one of the frustrations of the Wikileaks email dumps, the John Podesta emails, he is her campaign manager, runs her campaign is that the contents were often overlooked to essentially ask the question: Is Russia trying to influence the elections? , and as a former investigative reporter for the New York times, this is just not a legitimate question I spent many many years, 15 years with the Times, I was elated all sorts of information by all sorts of governments, from the French Intelligence agency to the Israeli Secret Service, the Mossad, to the U S government and these people were not leaking it because they cared about democracy or an open society, they were leaking this information because it was in their interest to do so, and my job, as a reporter, was to determine whether this leaked information was true or untrue and that s really the only thing the reporter should do with the leaked information on the Podesta emails But one of the things that as a reporter, as a former investigative reporter, that has   disturbed me is that they have I m talking about the press, especially about the electronic, commercial corporate press they have effectively ignored much of what is in the emails to carry up this speculation Meanwhile, of course, nobody has offered us any evidence that the Trump campaign is linked in any way to Russia or that Russia is responsible for the email dump SS:We re used to the fact that ordinary Americans don t really care about foreign policy, but this campaign has focused a lot on foreign issues and Russia in particular Are candidates trying to unite the nation by creating the image of a foreign threat? CH:Yeah It s very disturbing on many levels, the kind of neo conservative foreign policy cabal led by Robert Kagan and others that is around Clinton The very people who gave the disastrous Iraq war, are now proposing policies to bait Russia You know, it makes absolutely no sense to those of us who spend as many, as I did, two decades abroad as a foreign correspondent, except that it plays well politically into this very stunted, peculiar, neocon vision of the world, and that is that everybody out there only understands one language, and that s force That s how you see these 15 years now of war, the longest war in U S history It s been an utter disaster, utter failure, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and of course, Syria, and Libya and yet, what s the response? More bombs, more bombs, more bombs, which created the problems in the first place SS:Yeah, and do Americans like being scared by a foreign adversary? CH:No, I don t think they like it, but it s a very effective form of control Fear works, and Americans are hardly the only people to use it Terrorism, the specter of Russia whatever it is! Fear is a form of social control, and when you have essentially two political parties that are doing corporate bidding that serves the interests of corporate global elites, at the expense of the citizens they need fear, they need to manufacture fear, and I think that s what we re seeing SS:Trump has said things along the lines of this election is rigged and he s hinted that he may contend the results, which is kind of like admitting he ll be defeated Is this talk backfiring and scaring away voters? Why would people head to the ballots if they think their voice doesn t count anyway? CH:The Trump s base, primarily white lower working class, which has been dispossessed through de industrialisation, is going to head to the polls They are attempting to work within the system If the race is close and Trump loses, I think, everything we have seen, given the volatility of Trump, suggests that he will charge that the elections were rigged We certainly have seen evidence now, from in particular the leaked emails, of the rigging of the primaries on the part of the Democratic National Committee, on behalf of the Clintons It s pretty clear that Nevada Caucus was stolen, they blocked independents from voting in many of the primaries, in many of the states, and independents were Bernie Sanders primary base We just saw a few days ago, a day or two ago, that Clinton was actually leaked questions that would be given to her at a staged I mean, they call them Townhalls , they re totally Potemkin like reality shows, totally scripted so, it s enough to look into the inner workings to suggest that these people, the Clinton machine, the Democratic party do not play fair So, yeah, I think that that is the danger and the danger becomes then, when enraged Trump supporters believe that the system is rigged, the system is broken, it doesn t function fairly and that becomes dangerous, because these people will resort to kind of anarchic levels of violence SS:Filmmaker Michael Moore, who you can t call a Republican friendly figure exactly, called Trump a human Molotov cocktail  which desperate poor voters can throw at the system that stole their lives from them How come a Republican candidate is the candidate of the dispossessed, shouldn t Hillary be the one taking care of them? CH:Yeah That is the whole idea, that a billionaire developer is somehow the voice of the dispossessed, but he has tapped into this right wing populism This is coupled with a kind of xenophobia, kind of exalted nationalism, and a statement which is true, of course that the elites have betrayed the ordinary citizenry So, when Donald Trump goes to Michigan and stands before the executives from car manufacturers, who are moving their plants over the border, courtesy of NAFTA, to Mexico, and says that if you try to make cars in Mexico, I ll put a 35% tariff on it this is something that no candidate, in either party, has been saying, and there are many many really struggling I mean, half of this country now lives in poverty, people who have been waiting a long time for somebody to stand up and defy these corporate executives and CEOs who have destroyed their lives, the lives of their communities, destroyed the lives of their families So, in that sense, Trump is not a traditional Republican which is why the Republican establishment itself has united with the Democratic establishment to try and destroy the Trump presidency much as in 1972, the left wing insurgent candidate George McGovern saw the establishment of the Democratic party unite with the establishment of the Republican party to elect Richard Nixon SS:The election is estimated to have cost 6 6 billion dollars so far that s including the House and Senate campaign spending, and is likely to end up being even more pricey than that That s the whole budget of Bahrain Elections in India have four times as many voters and cost one billion less Is this price tag cutting off any truly independent candidate, like Bernie Sanders? CH:You can t compete, unless you can raise that kind of money, unless you can get into debates Bernie Sanders actually raised significant sums, he didn t do it through corporations, his average campaign contribution was $27 but yeah, you can t play in this game of political theater, unless you re bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars That is the part of the way they lock out third party candidates, like the Green party candidate Jill Stein SS:The Democratic party managed to fend off an anti system challenger Sanders how come the Republicans couldn t find anyone who could defeat Trump? CH:Because the establishment itself is so deeply hated, so when the Republican establishment finally did they didn t take him seriously in the beginning, and when they did turn on him, they trotted out the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney to attack him, and people just laughed It s the Romneys, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas, it s that establishment that people are turning against which is why Hillary Clinton is having such a difficult time competing against such an imbecilic, undisciplined and impulsive and, frankly, ignorant candidate SS:I m just wondering why is the media, even the right leaning media, which created Trump s phenomenon turning on him in this campaign? CH:Two reasons One he is attacking the trade agreements, which is how the elites make their money, and secondly, he s a public relations disaster for the U S I think those are the two reasons Maybe, the third reason is that they don t know what they re getting with Trump nobody knows what they re getting with Trump Trump doesn t know what he s getting with Trump, and they know that Clinton will maintain both the imperial overreach and the design of the corporate state So, Clinton s a sure bet and Trump is just too volatile a candidate, and that s why the establishment has turned on him SS:PresidentObama has hit the campaign trail to endorse Hillary Clinton he s warning that all the progress will go out the window if we don t make the right choice Do you think everything Obama achieved will really go out the window if Trump gets elected? CH:I don t think Obama has achieved very much His healthcare program which is essentially forcing citizens to buy defective corporate products and we re watching now massive increases, on an average of 22%, and people that have the bronze plan, different levels of plans cannot even afford the kinds of premiums and copayments  I mean, the whole system is a disaster His assault on civil liberties has been worse than under Bush, he has expanded imperial wars, in places like Libya, create more failed states I don t think Obama has much of a legacy He ll walk out and get rich and will start his own Foundation like the Clintons there s almost a complete continuity between Bush and Obama SS:A recent CNN ORC poll says Obama s approval rating is higher than at any time during his presidency why is he doing so great now that he s leaving? Is that his Hillary campaigning paying off? CH:You know, these people run very skilled public relations operations which revolve not around policy but around creating manufactured personalities, and that has been very difficult for Clinton and that s why Clinton has the second highest disapproval rating of any Presidential candidate as far as we know in American history, with the exception, of course, of the person she s competing against Donald Trump We have to look at what American politics is it s really about creating feelings, emotions, getting voters to confuse how they are made to feel with knowledge   It is not about actual policies, and both Michelle Obama who has a very high kind of favourability rating and Barack Obama have been skilled in doing that It s much more difficult, that s part of the problem, for the Clinton campaign SS:Looking back at the beginning of Obama s presidency, the   Nobel committee handed Obama the peace prize in 2009 not for his accomplishments, but   for his intentions But the promised peace didn t come to Afghanistan, didn t come to Iraq, we re seeing the unravelling of other Middle Eastern states did Obama s peace vision not only fail but make things worse? CH:Oh yeah, of course, look at Libya, look at Syria, look at Somalia, look at Iraq, look at Afghanistan, look at Pakistan No, it s a complete catastrophe I ve spent seven years in the Middle East, I was the Middle East bureau chief for the New York Times, and what we ve done is, I would argue, the greatest strategic blunder in American history, and it s one that Obama aided and abetted The whole idea of him as a peace candidate is I mean, I kind of gave up on the Nobel Prize Committee, I have no idea why this was done As you correctly pointed out, he hadn t even done anything SS:Was it a genuine inability to make things better, were his hands tied? CH:No He was an establishment candidate, he was selected, anointed and promoted by the Democratic Chicago political machine, which is one of the dirtiest in the country, he got more money in 2008 from Wall St than the Republican candidate who was against him McCain No, he s very cynical bright, talented, unlike George Bush, but deeply cynical candidate He brought in the old establishment, including the old Defence Secretary Robert Gates, who had been the Secretary of Defence under Bush, he brought in old these figures like Larry Summers and Geithner who are Wall St marionettes No, Obama knew very well what he was doing from the very beginning and effectively Look, he won Advertising Age s top annual award which was Marketer of the Year His campaign did, because the professionals knew just what he done he functioned as a brand for the corporate state, a very powerful and a very effective one SS:On the other hand America has restored relations with Cuba and reached a nuclear deal with Iran both seemed unachievable just a couple of years ago Do you count those as a Obama s foreign policy successes? CH:Yeah, they are foreign policy successes, but we have to understand that the Pentagon had long fought the neocons call for war with Iran, even under the Bush administration they put a stop to it So, there was no appetite within the American military establishment for war with Iran anyway So that wasn t really an option, despite Israeli pressure In terms of Cuba, it just got to the point of absurdity the boycott of Cuba, and we must also remember that the second generation of Cuban Americans did not have that kind of hatred towards Fidel Castro and towards the Cuban regime, and so it was politically safer for the Democratic party because the new generation, just like the new second and third generation of Jewish Americans don t have that loyalty to Israel it wasn t as politically volatile a decision SS:Obama made global zero a strategic objective however he failed to get America to ban nuclear tests by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty, while the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to three minutes to midnight that is to a nuclear war Why did Obama s promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American foreign policy backfire? CH:Because the military industrial establishment is so powerful in the United States that politicians serve its interests They don t dictate what the interests of that industry is officialy, it swallows about 53% of our discretionary budget, but that, of course, masks huge other expenditures, including for our nuclear weapon systems, which isn t counted for Veteran s affairs, which is huge for, if you want to count, the security and surveillance state, which is officially hidden, but probably at least a hundred billion dollars We re starving the rest of society to do that, and you can t fight these wars Indeed, if you were watching the Bernie Sander s campaign, Sanders did not take on imperial adventurism or the military establishment because you can t, within the American political system and Obama, I think, is an example of that SS:Police shootings of unarmed black men have sparked massive protests and the Black lives matter movement does Obama being the first black president actually mean little for race troubles in the U S ? CH:It means nothing, because you have de industrialised urban centres, i e places that once had factories and jobs, which are now in ruins you walk through them and it s boarded up factories and pothole streets and crumbling infrastructure, dysfunctional schools, and there are no jobs So you have created mini police states in these marginal communities, where police can serve, as we see, as Judge, Jury and Executioner three in one Americans, almost all poor people of colour, are shot by police in this country every day, and it s a form of social control, along, of course, with mass incarceration We have 25% of the world s prison population and 4% of the world s population most of those imprisoned are poor people of colour So, when you ve taken away the possibility for jobs and with it the possibilities for hope, for advancement, for inclusion within both the economic and political system then you need these very harsh forms of controls in order to keep people, essentially, fenced in That s why these killings don t stop, it doesn t matter how many protests are carried out, and Obama has quite sadly betrayed, if we go back especially to 2008 and even to 2012, his primary base African Americans voted in staggering numbers for Obama, I think, 90% or something Almost that high, and yet life for African Americans, I would argue, after 8 years of Obama, is worse than when he took power SS:We ve been talking to Chris Hedges, author, Pulitzer prize winning journalist, talking about the ups and downs of 2016 U S Presidential Campaign, and the end of the Obama era as the Americans are gearing up to choose their next President tomorrow We ll of course be watching the vote closely That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/365579-dirty-presidential-race-scandal/
"3 Nov, 2016",Assad: US waging proxy war in Syria against Russia & Iran,"Despite claiming humanitarian motives, US actions in Syria are meant to undermine the power of Russia and Iran, with Washington trying to achieve this goal by directly supporting terrorists, Syrian President Bashar Assad has said The US secret collaboration with terrorists is the reason why all attempts at a ceasefire and political transition in Syria have so far failed, the Syrian leadertoldSerbian newspaper Politika The interview was alsopublishedby the Syria s SANA news agency Supporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against Syria, against Iran, against Russia, that s how they look at it That s why not only this ceasefire every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative, every failure of these things, the United States was to blame, the Syrian president said Assad was referring to the deal negotiated by the US and Russia in September, which it was hoped would pave the way for a lasting truce in Syria In practice, the agreement was derailed by armed groups, which had rejected it from the very beginning The US pledged to convince the so called moderate opposition to stick to the bargain and separate from terrorists, who would then be legitimate targets for a joint Russian American air campaign Washington didn t deliver on this promise, however According to the Syrian president, a lasting ceasefire was not what Washington sought from the deal in the first place They always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation, not for the civilians And they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists, bring them logistic support, armament, money, everything, in order to re attack and to become stronger again, he said Sometimes the US support for terrorist groups goes through its allies such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Assad believes, while occasionally they provide direct support even to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), a group that the Washington led coalition was supposedly formed to defeat An example of this came during an American attack on Syrian Army troops near Deir Ez Zor, which happened while the US Russian truce was in force, and which the US claimed was the result of a mistake They attacked a very big area They didn t attack a building to say, we made a mistake They attacked three big hills, not other groups neighboring these hills, he said In less than one hour, ISIS attacked those hills It means that ISIS gathered their forces to attack those hills How did ISIS know that the Americans would attack that Syrian position? It means they were ready, they were prepared  Western media are currently focusing on civilian suffering in Syria and alleged atrocities committed by the Syrian government and its allies to justify deeper involvement in the war by whatever means the White House chooses, Assad said in the interview You have a black and white picture; very, very bad guy against very, very good guy It s like the narrative of George W Bush during the war on Iraq and on Afghanistan, he described The war in your country has been portrayed in the same way; as a humanitarian war where the West wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors from the other community, Assad said, referring to the Balkan Wars and the partitioning of Yugoslavia So, many people in the world believe that story, the same in Syria; they use the same mask, the humanitarian mask  READ MORE:  Russian experts collecting evidence of anti govt chemical attack in Aleppo Defense Ministry While stressing any wrongdoing on the part of the government forces, the West ignores whatever atrocities the opposition commits, the president said The terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in Aleppo, and wounded more than 300 You don t read anything about them in the Western mainstream media, he said They only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the Syrian government, not because they are worried about the Syrians  They don t care about our children, or about innocents, and about civilization, about infrastructure, he added But actually, they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests  The Syrian president doesn t expect the US approach to Syria to change, regardless of who wins the presidential election next week, he told the newspaper Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be bad for his country, he said We don t see any good signs that the United States is going to change dramatically its policy toward what s happening in the world or to obey the international law, or to care about the United Nation s Charter, he said It s not about who s going to be president; the difference will be very minimal, each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint, just personal fingerprint, but doesn t mean change of policies That s why we don t pin our hopes, we don t waste our time with it  Assad reiterated his assessment that if Syria were left to settle its problems without foreign interference, it would take it no more than a year to end the conflict, saying that it is not very complicated internally  Of course, that looks not realistic, because everybody knows that the United States wanted to undermine the position of Russia as a great power in the world, including in Syria Saudi Arabia has been looking how to destroy Iran for years now, and Syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that, according to their way of thinking, he said But if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we don t have a problem in solving our problem  The president said Syria has existed as a multiethnic multiconfessional entity for centuries and has significant experience in overcoming differences Without all different colors of the society Christians, Muslims, and the different sects and ethnicities you won t have Syria So, every Syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals, his traditions, his beliefs He should be free in order to have a stable country Otherwise you won t have Syria as a stable country, Assad said The war has been a huge ordeal for Syrian society, but it has made Syrians as a nation more united, not less, he added Many Syrians before the war didn t tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist, between being extremist and being terrorist Those borders weren t clear for many, the president said Because of the war, because of the destruction, because of the heavy price that affected every Syrian, many Syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous, to live with each other, to integrate, to accept, to love each other  That s why I think the effect of the war, in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war, but this aspect was positive for the Syrian society So, I m not worried about the structure of Syrian society after the war I think it s going to be healthier, Assad added RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/365202-assad-interview-serbian-media/
"28 Oct, 2016","Inside the invisible government: War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump","The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade behavior then considered outlandish One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo! Bernays influence extended far beyond advertising His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War The secret, he said, was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it  He described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government  Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood In my career as a journalist and film maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people But there is a vital difference In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V sign for victory There is scant mention of civilian casualties In the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by us  by the United States and Britain They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America US, UK sabotage any attempts at Syria settlement Political writer Dan Glazebrookhttps:// tdotco /diHrxk1wnGpic twitter com/ZXh3NAXFfg Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city Confusing? Not really Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia One is good; the other is bad What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003 That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al Qaeda and al Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today BREAKING: 6 children killed, over a dozen injured in rebel shelling of#Alepposchool (EXCLUSIVE)https:// tdotco /aw0a3f9ydn Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century The US television networks produced the same validation for George W Bush Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell s fabrications The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist I asked him, What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?  He replied that if journalists had done their job, there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq  It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous #Pentagonclaims 800 900 ISIS fighters dead in#Mosulbattlehttps:// tdotco /Xq58blwAh5pic twitter com/1tRW4qYzYT In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7th July 2005 There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande s bombast about France being at war and showing no mercy That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak When the truth is replaced by silence, said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, the silence is a lie  The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country From mad dog to model and back: How West changed its mind on Gaddafihttps:// tdotco /eAoKoxYdaWpic twitter com/IwaiToi8O3 The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an agreement  that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague Independence of this kind is intolerable As WikiLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage Why is this not news?

Who knows? He often contradicts himself But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House The CIA wants him beaten The Pentagon wants him beaten The media wants him beaten Even his own party wants him beaten He is a threat to the rulers of the world unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear armed Russia and China Clinton has the form, as she often boasts Indeed, her record is proven As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to totally obliterate Iran As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China She has now pledged to support a no fly zone in Syria a direct provocation for war with Russia Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime a distinction for which the competition is fierce Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders Today, the greatest build up of American led forces since World War Two is under way in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target US succeeded only in creating chaos in Syria, Iraq Middle East expert Marwa Osmanhttps:// tdotco /HpWwbpHS9G Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8th, if the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women None will mention Clinton s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya None will mention the civil defense drills being conducted in Russia None will recall Edward Bernays torches of freedom  George Bush s press spokesman once called the media complicit enablers Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons  This is adapted from an address to the Sheffield Festival of Words, Sheffield, England JohnPilger com the films and journalism of John Pilger The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/364567-terrorism-west-russia-wars-propaganda/
"20 Oct, 2016",From âmad dogâ to âmodelâ and back: How West changed its mind on Libyaâs Gaddafi,"In the 42 years that Colonel Muammar Gaddafi ruled Libya, Western views went from considering him a cartoon villain to believing him a model of international conduct and back to villain again, when the West backed an armed rebellion against him The Libyan Army officer who led the 1969 coup against King Idris I quickly became a thorn in the side of Western powers, nationalizing British Petroleum s holdings and withdrawing Libyan millions from British banks by 1971 Libya also led OPEC s oil boycott of the US in 1973, and Gaddafi became an outspoken advocate of the Palestinian cause It was under the Reagan administration that open hostilities flared up between Washington and Tripoli, however In 1981, the US Navy intensified what it called freedom of navigation patrols in the Sirte Gulf, which Gaddafi had declared exclusive Libyan waters US fighters shot down Libyan jets over Sirte on two occasions, in August 1981, and again in January 1989 In March 1986, a US Navy task force entered the Gulf and sank several Libyan Navy ships, killing 35 people Libya was blamed for the bombing of a discotheque in Germany in April 1986, which killed 2 US soldiers and injured 79 more, along with many civilians President Ronald Reagan called Gaddafi a mad dog of the Middle East, and ordered the US bombing of Libya, called Operation El Dorado Canyon Gaddafi s government was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, and placed under a sanctions regime Gaddafi was also accused of organizing the bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which crashed outside of Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 In 1992, the UN imposed sanctions against Libya, demanding it turn over those responsible for the attack Libyans were even presented as terrorists in US popular culture, notably in the 1985 movie Back to the Future  By 2003, however, it seemed like the tide had turned Gaddafi had declared his intent to surrender Libya s atomic and chemical weapons materials, and pay compensation to victims of the Berlin disco bombing and the Pan Am Lockerbie flight Libya s decision to abandon its weapons programs should become a model for other proliferators to mend their ways and help restore themselves to international legitimacy, Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance Paula DeSutter told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committeein May 2005   The US removed Libya from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006 Gaddafi is campaigning for the reintegration of his country into the international community, French PM Francois Fillon said in December 2007, as the Libyan leader was visiting Paris All those who want to lecture us should carefully weigh their words  In 2008, Italy offered Libya $5 billion in reparations for occupying the country between 1911 and 1941, and the government of Silvio Berlusconi signed several lucrative trade deals with Gaddafi Libya also agreed to stem the flow of immigrants from Africa, passing through the country on their way to Italy and the EU Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said he had heard Gaddafi speak with great moderation and a sense of duty when it comes to the most difficult problems facing the African continent  In 2004, Libya paid $35 million in compensation to the victims of the Berlin disco bombing In 2008, another $1 5 billion was paid into the fund to compensate victims of Pan Am 103 and Americans who died in the disco bombing, among others Libya served as a non permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2008 09 In February 2011, following the mass demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt, a rebellion against the Libyan government began in Benghazi, the country s second largest city and the historical capital of the Cyrenaica region Within days, the US and the European powers that had previously sang Gaddafi s praisesturned on him Citing UN Security Council Resolution 1973, which called for a no fly zone over Libya to protect civilians, the US, UK, France and several other powers began bombing Libya on March 19, 2011 The US had strategic command of the intervention, which was codenamed Operation Odyssey Dawn Alongside the air strikes and cruise missile attacks, special forces from the UK, France, Italy, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates worked with the rebels inside Libya We are doing it to protect the civilian population from the murderous madness of a regime that in killing its own people has lost all legitimacy, said French President Nicholas Sarkozy Colonel Gaddafi has made this happen He has lied to the international community He continues to brutalize his own people, said British Prime Minister David Cameron, adding, We cannot allow the slaughter of civilians to continue  The intervention s purpose was to protect civilians and it is to provide access for humanitarian assistance, said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave away the game as regime change, however, when he said that Gaddafi would simply will not be able to sustain his grip on the country  if his armed forces were destroyed The nature of this leader and the nature of his regime is they will massacre every single individual they even remotely suspect of disloyalty, Harper added US President Barack Obama simply skipped over the previous decade of relations with Libya, justifying the bombing to the American peopleon March 28by saying that Gaddafi has denied his people freedom, exploited their wealth, murdered opponents at home and abroad, and terrorized innocent people around the world including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents  Gaddafi himself seems to have been unaware of this speech whenhe wrote Obamaon April 6, asking him personally to stop the bombing and reminding him that democracy and building of civil society cannot be achieved by means of missiles and aircraft, or by backing armed members of Al Qaeda in Benghazi  Gaddafi s words fell on deaf ears The NATO backed rebellion succeeded in seizing almost all of the country by October 2011 On October 20, Gaddafi tried to break out of Sirte, but his convoy was bombed by NATO aircraft He was captured, tortured and killed by militants loyal to the Western backed National Transitional Council government, proclaimed the month prior We came, we saw, he died, quipped Hillary Clinton, learning of Gaddafi s death during a CBS interview Libya plunged into chaos, with factions in Tripoli and Benghazi fighting each other, and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) raising its flag over Sirte Today there is no government of Libya It s simply mobs that patrol the streets and kill one another, Virginia State Senator Richard Black told RT We were willing to absolutely wipe out and crush their civilization  The Libyans had an incredibly high standard of living, the highest in Africa When I first went to Libya in 1986, I was amazed by the empowerment of women, international lawyer Francis Boyle told RT What I saw in Libya was that women could do anything they wanted to do  Among the world leaders saddened by Gaddafi s death was Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa In the darkest moments of our struggle, when our backs were to the wall, Muammar Gaddafi stood with us, he said In 1997, Mandela defied the UN embargo to visit Gaddafi and thank him for his support during the anti apartheid struggle US President Bill Clinton called the visit unwelcome  No country can claim to be the policeman of the world and no state can dictate to another what it should do, replied the former political prisoner RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved

"23 Aug, 2016",Provoking nuclear war by media â John Pilger,"The exoneration of a man accused of the worst of crimes, genocide, made no headlines Neither the BBC nor CNN covered it The Guardian allowed a brief commentary Such a rare official admission was buried or suppressed, understandably It would explain too much about how the rulers of the world rule The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)  has quietly cleared the late Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, of war crimes committed during the 1992 95 Bosnian war, including the massacre at Srebrenica Far from conspiring with the convicted Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Milosevic actually condemned ethnic cleansing , opposed Karadzic and tried to stop the war that dismembered Yugoslavia Buried near the end of a 2,590 page judgement on Karadzic last February, this truth further demolishes the propaganda that justified Nato s illegal onslaught on Serbia in 1999 Milosevic died of a heart attack in 2006, alone in his cell in The Hague, during what amounted to a bogus trial by an American invented international tribunal  Denied heart surgery that might have saved his life, his condition worsened and was monitored and kept secret by US officials, as WikiLeaks has since revealed Milosevic was the victim of war propaganda that today runs like a torrent across our screens and newspapers and beckons great danger for us all He was the prototype demon, vilified by the western media as the butcher of the Balkans who was responsible for genocide , especially in the secessionist Yugoslav province of Kosovo Prime Minister Tony Blair said so, invoked the Holocaust and demanded action against this new Hitler  David Scheffer, the US ambassador at large for war crimes [sic], declared that as many as 225,000 ethnic Albanian men aged between 14 and 59 may have been murdered by Milocevic s forces This was the justification for Nato s bombing, led by Bill Clinton and Blair, that killed hundreds of civilians in hospitals, schools, churches, parks and television studios and destroyed Serbia s economic infrastructure It was blatantly ideological; at a notorious peace conference in Rambouillet in France, Milosevic was confronted by Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, who was to achieve infamy with her remark that the deaths of half a million Iraqi children were worth it  Albright delivered an offer to Milosevic that no national leader could accept Unless he agreed to the foreign military occupation of his country, with the occupying forces outside the legal process , and to the imposition of a neo liberal free market , Serbia would be bombed This was contained in an Appendix B , which the media failed to read or suppressed The aim was to crush Europe s last independent socialist  state Once Nato began bombing, there was a stampede of Kosovar refugees fleeing a holocaust  When it was over, international police teams descended on Kosovo to exhume the victims The FBI failed to find a single mass grave and went home The Spanish forensic team did the same, its leader angrily denouncing a semantic pirouette by the war propaganda machines  The final count of the dead in Kosovo was 2,788 This included combatants on both sides and Serbs and Roma murdered by the pro Nato Kosovo Liberation Front There was no genocide The Nato attack was both a fraud and a war crime All but a fraction of America s vaunted precision guided missiles hit not military but civilian targets, including the news studios of Radio Television Serbia in Belgrade Sixteen people were killed, including cameramen, producers and a make up artist Blair described the dead, profanely, as part of Serbia s command and control  In 2008, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Carla Del Ponte, revealed that she had been pressured not to investigate Nato s crimes This was the model for Washington s subsequent invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and, by stealth, Syria All qualify as paramount crimes under the Nuremberg standard; all depended on media propaganda While tabloid journalism played its traditional part, it was serious, credible, often liberal journalism that was the most effective the evangelical promotion of Blair and his wars by the Guardian, the incessant lies about Saddam Hussein s non existent weapons of mass destruction in the Observer and the New York Times, and the unerring drumbeat of government propaganda by the BBC in the silence of its omissions At the height of the bombing, the BBC s Kirsty Wark interviewed General Wesley Clark, the Nato commander The Serbian city of Nis had just been sprayed with American cluster bombs, killing women, old people and children in an open market and a hospital Wark asked not a single question about this, or about any other civilian deaths Others were more brazen In February 2003, the day after Blair and Bush had set fire to Iraq, the BBC s political editor, Andrew Marr, stood in Downing Street and made what amounted to a victory speech He excitedly told his viewers that Blair had said they would be able to take Baghdad without a bloodbath, and that in the end the Iraqis would be celebrating And on both of those points he has been proved conclusively right Today, with a million dead and a society in ruins, Marr s BBC interviews are recommended by the US embassy in London Marr s colleagues lined up to pronounce Blair vindicated  The BBC s Washington correspondent, Matt Frei, said, There s no doubt that the desire to bring good, to bring American values to the rest of the world, and especially to the Middle East is now increasingly tied up with military power  This obeisance to the United States and its collaborators as a benign force bringing good runs deep in western establishment journalism It ensures that the present day catastrophe in Syria is blamed exclusively on Bashar al Assad, whom the West and Israel have long conspired to overthrow, not for any humanitarian concerns, but to consolidate Israel s aggressive power in the region The jihadist forces unleashed and armed by the US, Britain, France, Turkey and their coalition  proxies serve this end It is they who dispense the propaganda and videos that becomes news in the US and Europe, and provide access to journalists and guarantee a one sided coverage of Syria The city of Aleppo is in the news Most readers and viewers will be unaware that the majority of the population of Aleppo lives in the government controlled western part of the city That they suffer daily artillery bombardment from western sponsored al Qaida is not news On 21 July, French and American bombers attacked a government village in Aleppo province, killing up to 125 civilians This was reported on page 22 of the Guardian; there were no photographs Having created and underwritten jihadism in Afghanistan in the 1980s as Operation Cyclone a weapon to destroy the Soviet Union the US is doing something similar in Syria Like the Afghan Mujahideen, the Syrian rebels are America s and Britain s foot soldiers Many fight for al Qaida and its variants; some, like the Nusra Front, have rebranded themselves to comply with American sensitivities over 9/11 The CIA runs them, with difficulty, as it runs jihadists all over the world The immediate aim is to destroy the government in Damascus, which, according to the most credible poll (YouGov Siraj), the majority of Syrians support, or at least look to for protection, regardless of the barbarism in its shadows The long term aim is to deny Russia a key Middle Eastern ally as part of a Nato war of attrition against the Russian Federation that eventually destroys it The nuclear risk is obvious, though suppressed by the media across the free world  The editorial writers of the Washington Post, having promoted the fiction of WMD in Iraq, demand that Obama attack Syria Hillary Clinton, who publicly rejoiced at her executioner s role during the destruction of Libya, has repeatedly indicated that, as president, she will go further than Obama Gareth Porter, a journalist reporting from Washington, recently revealed the names of those likely to make up a Clinton cabinet, who plan an attack on Syria All have belligerent cold war histories; the former CIA director, Leon Panetta, says that the next president is gonna have to consider adding additional special forces on the ground  What is most remarkable about the war propaganda now in flood tide is its patent absurdity and familiarity I have been looking through archive film from Washington in the 1950s when diplomats, civil servants and journalists were witch hunted and ruined by Senator Joe McCarthy for challenging the lies and paranoia about the Soviet Union and China Like a resurgent tumor, the anti Russia cult has returned In Britain, the Guardian s Luke Harding leads his newspaper s Russia haters in a stream of journalistic parodies that assign to Vladimir Putin every earthly iniquity When the Panama Papers leak was published, the front page said Putin, and there was a picture of Putin; never mind that Putin was not mentioned anywhere in the leaks Like Milosevic, Putin is Demon Number One It was Putin who shot down a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine Headline: As far as I m concerned, Putin killed my son No evidence required It was Putin who was responsible for Washington s documented (and paid for) overthrow of the elected government in Kiev in 2014 The subsequent terror campaign by fascist militias against the Russian speaking population of Ukraine was the result of Putin s aggression  Preventing Crimea from becoming a Nato missile base and protecting the mostly Russian population who had voted in a referendum to rejoin Russia from which Crimea had been annexed were more examples of Putin s aggression  Smear by media inevitably becomes war by media If war with Russia breaks out, by design or by accident, journalists will bear much of the responsibility In the US, the anti Russia campaign has been elevated to virtual reality The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, an economist with a Nobel Prize, has called Donald Trump the Siberian Candidate because Trump is Putin s man, he says Trump had dared to suggest, in a rare lucid moment, that war with Russia might be a bad idea In fact, he has gone further and removed American arms shipments to Ukraine from the Republican platform Wouldn t it be great if we got along with Russia, he said This is why America s warmongering liberal establishment hates him Trump s racism and ranting demagoguery have nothing to do with it Bill and Hillary Clinton s record of racism and extremism can out trump Trump s any day (This week is the 20th anniversary of the Clinton welfare reform  that launched a war on African Americans) As for Obama: while American police gun down his fellow African Americans the great hope in the White House has done nothing to protect them, nothing to relieve their impoverishment, while running four rapacious wars and an assassination campaign without precedent The CIA has demanded Trump is not elected Pentagon generals have demanded he is not elected The pro war New York Times taking a breather from its relentless low rent Putin smears demands that he is not elected Something is up These tribunes of perpetual war are terrified that the multi billion dollar business of war by which the United States maintains its dominance will be undermined if Trump does a deal with Putin, then with China s Xi Jinping Their panic at the possibility of the world s great power talking peace however unlikely would be the blackest farce were the issues not so dire Trump would have loved Stalin! bellowed Vice President Joe Biden at a rally for Hillary Clinton With Clinton nodding, he shouted, We never bow We never bend We never kneel We never yield We own the finish line That s who we are We are America!  In Britain, Jeremy Corbyn has also excited hysteria from the war makers in the Labour Party and from a media devoted to trashing him Lord West, a former admiral and Labour minister, put it well Corbyn was taking an outrageous anti war position because it gets the unthinking masses to vote for him  In a debate with leadership challenger Owen Smith, Corbyn was asked by the moderator: How would you act on a violation by Vladimir Putin of a fellow Nato state?  We found out 20 years later they were lying about Milosevic They're doing the same lying about Assad now@HKX07@snarwani@Souria4Syrians Corbyn replied: You would want to avoid that happening in the first place You would build up a good dialogue with Russia We would try to introduce a de militarisation of the borders between Russia, the Ukraine and the other countries on the border between Russia and Eastern Europe What we cannot allow is a series of calamitous build ups of troops on both sides which can only lead to great danger  Pressed to say if he would authorize war against Russia if you had to ,Corbyn replied: I don t wish to go to war what I want to do is achieve a world that we don t need to go to war  The line of questioning owes much to the rise of Britain s liberal war makers The Labour Party and the media have long offered them career opportunities For a while the moral tsunami of the great crime of Iraq left them floundering, their inversions of the truth a temporary embarrassment Regardless of Chilcot and the mountain of incriminating facts, Blair remains their inspiration, because he was a winner  Dissenting journalism and scholarship have since been systematically banished or appropriated, and democratic ideas emptied and refilled with identity politics that confuse gender with feminism and public angst with liberation and willfully ignore the state violence and weapons profiteering that destroys countless lives in faraway places, like Yemen and Syria, and beckon nuclear war in Europe and across the world The stirring of people of all ages around the spectacular rise of Jeremy Corbyn counters this to some extent His life has been spent illuminating the horror of war The problem for Corbyn and his supporters is the Labour Party In America, the problem for the thousands of followers of Bernie Sanders was the Democratic Party, not to mention their ultimate betrayal by their great white hope In the US, home of the great civil rights and anti war movements, it is Black Lives Matter and the likes of Codepink that lay the roots of a modern version For only a movement that swells into every street and across borders and does not give up can stop the warmongers Next year, it will be a century since Wilfred Owen wrote the following Every journalist should read it and remember it If you could hear, at every jolt, the bloodCome gargling from the froth corrupted lungs,Obscene as

"25 Jul, 2016","In US, black people cast as enemies of state & criminals - BLM organizer","A black caregiver shot by police in the leg while trying to help his patient Another black man shot and killed after officers pin him to the ground A black school employee shot in the car, while his wife and child are forced to witness the killing Cases like this grab attention day after day, fueling a massive uproar against police brutality and indiscriminate killings of unarmed black civilians The Black Lives Matter movement has turned into one of the most powerful voices in America How big is its impact on US politics and society? We ask a woman who was at the origins of the movement Pan African Studies Professor at the California State University, Black Lives Matter organizer in LA Dr Melina Abdullah on Sophie&Co today Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:   Dr Melina Abdullah, organiser of the Black Lives Matter movement, professor at California State University, welcome to the show, it s really great to have you with us Dr Abdullah, the black community s facing war time conditions now, those are your words What makes you say that? Is it really worse now than during the times of segregation? During the Civil Rights fight? Melina Abdullah: Well, I think that when we say war time conditions , we need to think about what s happening in our city communities, and black communities especially We are referring specifically to the way that we re being policed, the way that we re being surveilled and brutalised and killed at the hands of the state So, that s what I m referring to Of course, that s the most extreme form, however, there s also other forms in which we are under attack, so if we think about black Health Indexes, when we think about the black jobs crisis, if we think about the way in which black children come under attack even in their own schools Those are all war time conditions, those are all conditions that places us in a constant state of struggle and battle and having to fight for our freedom SS: According to MappingPoliceViolence org , a group that collects data on the issue, police killed over a hundred blacks last year and that s at least two deaths a week Most of those killed were unarmed What do you think when you hear such a number? Why is this happening? Is there an explanation for that? MA: We have to go back to the purpose of policing in the U S in the first place The policing system here developed, evolved out of the system of slave patrols, so our current policing system was actually set up to put black people, cast black people as the enemies of the state So that s what we see when we see kind of police treating black people as if they are criminals even when they re doing things, everyday things like walking home from the store, like playing in the park with toys in the case of Tamir Rice I think we need to understand the political history of policing here, that although we like to lift up the model Protect and Serve that has never been what the police in the U S have been developed to do SS: Coroner s reports on fatal police shootings say that over the past 5 years, police in LA have fatally shot black people at triple the rate than other races Do police officers target black people because it s believed that they re more likely to be criminals, or because of some kind of, I don t know, animosity towards the actual race? But, if it s racism, then why isn t the police targeting other minorities? MA: I think that s a really complex question I think that what we re often kind of encouraged to do is get into the individual psychology of officers What we want to encourage folks to do is to step back and recognise that the entire institution of policing, the entire system of police as one is built on institutional racism So, the intent of the police officers, of the individual police officers is actually determined by the system that does, in fact, cast black people especially as enemies of the state, and so black people are never given the benefit of the doubt, black people with mental health issues for instance you ve brought up LA one of the most recent and horrific killings was that of brother Africa  Charly Keunang  who was Cameroonian immigrant and lived in the homeless community in Skid Row, who was killed in broad daylight by LAPD Rather than trying to understand it on the individual psychological basis we need to understand that it s the entire institution, and really re imagine and re define the way that policing works, create a new model of policing SS: But how do you do that? Dr Abdullah, how do you do that? MA: I think you have to create a model of policing that s grounded in community You have to create a model of public safety: so, let s move back from policing, even a model of public safety that says what conditions created Skid Row in Los Angeles in the first place So, public safety can t be focused solely on policing, it has to say: Well, you know, people shouldn t have to live on the streets We have to come up with models of public safety that say: we re going to have unsafe environments as long as people are walking around the country with mental health conditions We re going to have public safety issues as long as people don t have jobs that pay a livable wage, and so let s roll it back and look at policing as one small piece of public safety SS: Ferguson is one example where the police force is predominantly white despite a predominantly black community, and most officers are not even living in the area that they serve Is there a reason locals don t join the police force? I mean, are they prevented from joining? MA: There s a trend in American cities of having police living outside the communities Police unions and other folks argue that it s for the police officers safety We know that it threatens community s safety, and so there s this whole notion that if police lved in the communities that they re supposed to be serving, that somehow they ll be more at risk The data actually does not meet that out, however SS: You know, only a handful of police officers were charged with crimes after the killings of black civilians last year I mean, 9 out of 102 cases! That s a mind boggling number A police officer is far less likely to be prosecuted for a crime than a civilian, and jury in court usually side with the police Does that give a police officer a sense of impunity? I mean, can an activist movement influence this? MA: Absolutely Just about every case, police officers are not convicted or even tried for the killings of residents So, we can think about the case of Tamir Rice, we can think about the case of Ezell Ford Even when the officers are found out of policy in those killings, usually criminals charges don t follow, and so it sends a message to police officers that especially when they kill black people, they don t have to be worried about either disciplinary action or so, and in a very few cases they re even fired from their jobs and even rarer there s a criminal prosecution of police officers SS: You know, mayors of Chicago and Baltimore have actually fired their police chiefs after the BLM protest, which shows that the movement does have influence but what s the guarantee that the new police chiefs will crack down on this abuse? MA: Well, here, in Los Angeles we re trying to follow suit, we are trying to get our police chief Charlie Beck, fired We think that by doing that, when we can create the pressure that creates the firing of the police chief, it sends a message to the next chief that at least they have to kind of be on notice So, while we re not under any illusions that new police chiefs are going to be head and shoulders above previous police chiefs, we do think that it puts them on notice that they have to at least pay attention to the community and pay attention to those of us who re demanding justice for our communities SS: You often hear that the U S has the largest prison population in the world and the black population incarceration rate is 6 times higher than that of white people Is there an explanation for this? Why is this system skewed towards jailing black people? MA: The data shows us that this kind of ramping up, this prison boom came right after the Civil Rights movement and Black Power movements of the 1960s and 1970s So you see a prison boom happen in the 1970s after political candidates start pushing this Law and Order sentiment So, what s interesting is not a correlation between increasing crime and increasing imprisonment: rather, it s a shift in kind of the politics, and so, there s a political motivation behind imprisonment of black people that can be linked back to the push of black folks for civil rights and for political and human rights we need to understand that there s a political motivation to jail in black folks We also need to understand that black people have always been much higher than their population share, in prisons , and that has to do with what we talked about earlier this undergirding kind of institutional racism that underlies every system within the U S So, the U S was founded upon the genocide of indigenous people and enslavement of black people and nothing has been done to undo that institutional racism It s most extreme in prisons, where we see these numbers of black people really kind of ridiculous in comparison with our population share SS:   You ve said: this system is set up to keep us oppressed that s your quote, meaning today as well Do you mean to say it s deliberately aimed against black people? MA: Yes It is built to keep us oppressed So, that s why it takes much more than reform to undo this oppressive system We have to have a complete reimagining, we have to be willing to say why are these systems built that way and how can we rebuild something that s new, not simply reform what it is So, we can talk about the Criminal Justice system, we can talk about, you know, Angela Davis rights, about why prisons are obsolete and we have to be willing to really go with those arguments, and say maybe it s not just having a kinder, gentler way of putting people in cages, maybe we need to really step back, reimagine, and say: Perhaps, there s something wrong with the model that puts people in cages in the first place SS:   Dr Abdullah, you were saying before the break that the system is deliberately oppressing black community , but who needs to target the black community? Who benefits from keeping the black community down? Who is waging war, as you say, on the African Americans? MA: The folks at the very top, rich white men, and when we understand that, when we understand that the super exploitation of black people really allows them to profit as heads of corporations, as ones who re invested in the system of capitalism, as those who benefit from the system of white supremacy and patriarchy It allows them to capitalise off of our oppression So, there s profit that s derived from the ways in which we work disproportionately at low wage jobs, from our high unemployment rate, which creates this super competition for jobs There s benefit that comes ¦ We ve talked about the prison industrial complex, we need to understand that prisoners actually serve as commodities, as super exploited labor and as super exploited consumers, so when we think about people who are running for president, people like, you known, Donald Trump or Drumpf, or, when we think about how he derives profit and people like him of course, it s not just him, what we would call in America, there s not a single boogeyman, there s lots of boogeymen, who are deriving profit from this system SS: Now, the movement has decided against endorsing any candidate in the presidential race Does that mean you re not hopeful anything will change in the coming years? MA: Oh, no, we re extremely hopeful We just recognised that the kind of change, the kind of transformative change that we need won t come because Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump are elected We understand that the change that we seek will come because the people demand it SS:There s a two term black president in the White House, and the African American community is still reeling from police shooting, injustice, inequality Does this mean elections are useless for the community, that they change nothing when it comes to racism? MA: It doesn t really matter that Barack Obama happens to be black, right, because he is in the presidency which really kind of just keeps this existing structure, keeps these institutions and keeps the system moving along, and even if he had the political will, which he has not demonstrated having let me be very clear that he could have done more, but he hasn t had the political will Had he had the political will to do more, had he had the political will to kind of really undo or push substantive change into systems like our policing system and really end the system of mass incarceration we probably could have seen more change happen, but we would not have seen the kind of change that we need, because this system is already in place I don t think that voting is completely useless I vote That said, I think that the two party system that we have in the U S is hugely problematic, because both the Democratic party and the Republican party are completely reliant on capitalism and capitalist corporations, corporate support for their candidacies For a presidential candidate to be viable, they basically have to be endorsed by big business, which means that big business wants something, including the continued exploitation of working class and the black working class, especially SS: The White House invited several civil rights leaders including some Black Lives matter supporters for a meeting One of the movement s leaders snubbed the President s invitation as a photo op Do you think authorities are genuinely interested in working with the movement? Taking it seriously? MA: No, and I think that Aislinn, who was our member, who was invited, took a very principal position and said that we re not here for a photo op What we want is substance SS: BLM has been criticised for some of it s methods, like disrupting presidential candidates rallies, shutting down road access, etc Now you ve said that polite conversation doesn t work, do you see these other methods working? MA: Yeah Polite conversation absolutely does not work There s no group on Earth who is expected to politely sit down with a group of folks who are murdering us, at the rates that police murders us, and not just you know, they re murdering our children, our grandfathers, our mothers We can t simply sit down and have polite conversation We have to disrupt that system SS: Right, but since the movement is horizontal in organisation, leaderless, collective does it take responsibility for radical actions of some of its chapters? MA: We are by definition a if you think about radicalism, you used that term as being the disruption of what is, as being a kind of a seeking out for transformation we are a radical organisation We seek transformative change We re not violent, we re a non violent movement, but we believe in transformative change and we don t believe that that change comes from sitting down and negotiating policy reforms We need policy change but not reform, we need policy transformation SS: Activists are taking advantage of the media attention focusing on elections protesting at events This has worked candidates like Clinton are meeting with protesters, issues are raised, campaign promises uttered How can the movement keep pressure on whoever s elected after the vote? Do BLM activists risk just being used for good press? MA: We think that when we disrupt candidates, the press is already there, and really what we re doing is challenging the candidates to think more deeply about the issues that affect the black community What s happening in the U S is not just disruptions of candidates but of sitting elected officials, and so our mayors, our governors have all been disrupted and challenged to consider what it is we re putting forth and that has had policy outcomes SS: You ve also, met with the LA mayor Eric Garcetti along with other movement organisers some time ago Later he appointed a black man Matt Johnson as police commissioner, which is a good thing He was tasked with monitoring police violence and other issues Is this a direct result of your actions? Are you being heard in your local community? MA: No, unfortunately, mayor Garcetti so, you ve mentioned that he appointed a black man to the police commission we really are not simply about symbolic gestures It doesn t matter to us if somebody happens to be black if they don t move on behalf of the black community Matt Johnson is not rooted in the black community, Eric Garcetti has chosen to run from the black community rather than engage it So, these kinds of things we don t see as real victories We want substantive change So, we have pushed the Police Commission, despite Matt Johnson, to move towards changes, and they implemented a small set of reforms, we know that has to do with our pressure, but it s not enough We do feel like pressure works, we just recognise that these kind of symbolic gestures are attempts to pacify us and placate us, but don t really get to the substance of what we want We re not fooled by neoliberals Eric Garcetti is an example of a neoliberal, who will still ignore the black community but smile as he s doing that SS: But you guys the BLM is happy to be working outside the system, as I assume? Why aren t the existing institutions black church networks, black lawmakers talking of black community, by the way working closely with the movement? MA: It s important to recognize that just because a lawmaker happens to be black doesn t mean that they have the interests of the black community at heart Many lawmakers, many politicians are in it for themselves, for their own individual advancement So, it s always been the position of blacks outside organizations If we think about the Black Power movement and the Black Panther Party the role of our organisations is to push these folks to do what s in the interests of the whole, not act in their own self interest SS: I remember the Occupy Movement caused a political storm but then it quickly faded away what needs to be done to ensure the same fate doesn t await the Black Lives Matter? MA: BLM is on a growth trajectory We started 2 5 years ago with about 30 folks We have now tens of thousands of active members, and we re global, we have 39 Chapters around the world We re growing and I think as long as we continue to be imaginative in what we re pushing for, as long as we re rooted in the actual needs of the Black Community, as long as the masses of black folks continue to be targeted by the system and need to seek change outside of that system, because that system itself is not serving us we ll continue to grow We ve learned lessons from the Occupy Movement, right So, I think that we re continuing to move forward, I think that we re moving in ways that are actually changing things substantively and I think that you ll continue to see it If you think about what s happening in Toronto, Canada, with black folks in Canada, black Canadians, rising up and saying that they recognise that they re under similar conditions to what we experience here, and that Chapter really being willing to challenge things fundamentally I think that you see something happening that indicates of global growing movement SS:   Thank you so much for this wonderful insight Dr Melina Abdullah pan African studies professor at the California State University, one of the leaders of the Black Lives Matter LA Chapter, talking about what is pushing black people in America to the streets in protests and what can this new nationwide movement accomplish That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, I will see you next time  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/353077-black-lives-police-us/
"12 Jul, 2016","Who will protect Main Street, USA from militarized police forces?","A radical transformation is occurring inside US society as local police, government agencies and even colleges are stockpiling military grade weapons, as well as military training How did this perilous scenario come to pass under a Democratic president? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Ironically, and potentially tragically, at the very same time Sheriff Obama seems determined to disarm Americans of their cherished Second Amendment, US police forces are steadily stockpiling an arsenal of weapons that would be the envy of many a foreign army And those weapons are not just harmlessly gathering dust in the closet Indeed, with alarming regularity the weapons, equipment and training are being put to use against the very citizens the police were meant to serve and protect In 2014, the ACLU released a startlingreporton the militarization of US police forces In it, investigators examined the cache of weapons being collected by US states, which then distribute the hardware to localities Here is a list of the military toys that just one state Arizona got courtesy of Uncle Sam:32 bomb suits, 704 units of night vision equipment, 1,034 guns, of which 712 are rifles, 42 forced entry tools, such as battering rams, 830 units of surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, 13,409 personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or uniforms, 120 utility trucks, 64 armored vehicles, 4 GPS devices, 17 helicopters, 21,211 other types of military equipment Over 100 arrests made nationwide in Black Lives Matter protestshttps:// tdotco /dEomYz0TcVpic twitter com/rygq2HBnDG The immediate problem with handing over such massive firepower to state and local agencies is the same problem confronted by every military: Eventually those spanking new weapons, and regardless how lethal they are, will be used Yet the Obama administration, which has had a full 8 years to address the issue, has let the problem fester to the point where trust as witnessed by the tragicevents in Dallaslast week has completely broken down between members of the American public and the police The argument I would like to make here, in light of the ongoing string of American tragedies, is thatthe militarization of the police as opposed to the police officers themselves is the real culprit Our civil servants were never meant to be members of standing armies, working on behalf of faceless corporate entities Last year, according to an exhaustivereportin the Washington Post, 990 Americans were killed by the police more than two times the recently reported compilation of fatalities Meanwhile, with over 500 US citizens already killed by the police this year, 2016 is on track to exceed last year s recording breaking tally by a wide margin Incidentally, lest we think police related killings are simply a manifestation of race, the number of White Americans killed by police last year (494) was almost two times the number of Black Americans killed in the same period (258) The investigative journalism group ProPublica, using FBI data from 1980 to 2012,reportedthat 44 percent of all those killed by police were in fact white If the police had more training on how to defuse potentially explosive situations instead of receiving military tactical training, would the streets of America be the better for it? I think the answer to the question is obvious Presently, citizens and police alike are being victimized by a system that recklessly throws a lot of military weapons and military training into communities in the belief that firepower alone will deter crime (which, in many cases, is symptomatic of a faltering economy) That militaristic approach has clearly failed All things considered, it would be more helpful and less divisive for Americans to promote the idea that Human Life Matters as opposed to Black Lives, White Lives or What have you Lives when considering the disturbing new phenomenon of police violence Tear gas, 102 arrested, 21 cops injured in Black Lives Matter protests in St Paul (VIDEO)https:// tdotco /6fjuLH2b0rpic twitter com/VtTomANtHK I am just old enough to remember the days when American neighborhoods were not the running battlefields many have become today, a less neurotic time when police resorting to armored vehicles, menacing weaponry and military tactics was the great exception not the rule Observatory Hill, the diverse, middle class Pittsburgh neighborhood where I enjoyed a crime free childhood in the 1970s, is no longer remotely recognizable to me A healthy, vibrant, God fearing community just30 years ago, Observatory Hill now plays occasional host tovisiting SWAT teamssearching for the latest drug pusher or violent offender These SWAT visits, however, are no longer reserved for hunting down the occasional criminal in the hood Excessive police force is also being employed to crackdown on democratic demonstrations against the powers that be To use my hometown of Pittsburgh yet again as an example, consider what happened in October 2009 amid a G 20 Summit University of Pittsburgh students, protesting peacefully against the global movers and shakers, said they were subjected to heavy handed police tactics that included the use of tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and, freshly introduced for the first time in the US, sound cannons [officially known as the Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD, the only other time this device was reportedly used was by the US military in Iraq] Nearly 200 people were arrested during the protests Bill Quigley, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights,explainedin an interview with Democracy Now what he saw in Pittsburgh during the G 20 Well, we saw a heavily militarized town The police really were supposed to be there for terrorists, and when no terrorists showed up, they turned their power and their toys, including this, first time in the United States, sound cannon, on protesters, and unfortunately, in the evenings, on the students It was a complete overreaction The people of Pittsburgh worked really hard to put on a good peace protest, to talk  challenge globalization, to talk about immigration, Iraq, Afghanistan and all these things And the security forces were just totally out of hand  Following Pittsburgh s no contest showdown against Robocop, Boston got a glimpse of full blown martial law following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings in which three people died Former Senator Ron Paul said the government s over the top response to the attacks should frighten Americans more than the attack itself In an article entitled Liberty Was Also Attacked in Boston , Paulcomparedthe door to door searches without warrants for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to scenes from a military coup in a far off banana republic  These were not the scenes from a military coup in a far off banana republic, but rather the scenes just over a week ago in Boston as the United States got a taste of martial law The ostensible reason for the military style takeover of parts of Boston was that the accused perpetrator of a horrific crime was on the loose The Boston bombing provided the opportunity for the government to turn what should have been a police investigation into a military style occupation of an American city, Paul wrote The former US statesman could have been paraphrasing one of America s Founders when he reminded: We have been conditioned to believe that the job of the government is to keep us safe, but in reality the job of the government is to protect our liberties Once the government decides that its role is to keep us safe they can only do so by taking away our liberties That is what happened in Boston  Benjamin Franklin was of a similar mind when he warned over 200 years ago: Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety #BlackLivesMattermay suffer the same fate as the Occupy movement [VIDEO]https:// tdotco /9pYOLcfm9M@LindsayFrance@real_alexm From the streets of Los Angeles to New York City, an increasing number of Americans are asking, as investigative reporter Radley Balko did in his 2014 book, Rise of the Warrior Cop, how Americans came to inherit a system where protests are met with flash grenades, pepper spray, and platoons of riot teams dressed like Robocops and order is preserved by armed government agents too often conditioned to see streets and neighborhoods as battlefields and the citizens they serve as the enemy?  The answer can be found in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Signed into law by President Bill Clinton on Sept 23, 1996, Section 1033 of the NDAA allowed for the transfer of excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies The American public only started getting suspicious about the transformation of their police into something akin to a paramilitary outfit following the 2014 shooting of unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, and the protests that erupted in Ferguson, Missouri thereafter In response to the riots, police deployed armored MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) assault vehicles and firearms, together with police that appeared better outfitted for a role in a Star Wars battle scene as opposed to a public protest in a suburb of St Louis Forbes magazine put the police purchases into perspective: Pentagon donations to the police reached $532 million in 2012 and $449 million in 2013 The figure has already topped $750 million in 2014 A new MRAP sells for somewhere between $500,000 and $700,000 but law enforcement agencies are picking up these valuable beasts for free through the 1033 program  This inexplicable hoarding of guns and ammo presents not just a threat to the citizens of the United States It also presents a real problem for the police themselves who are increasingly now looked upon with fear and loathing by many people who believe the police no longer uphold the motto to protect and serve  Better to de militarize the police forces and let the US Army keep their lethal toys for themselves @Robert_Bridge

"6 Jul, 2016",âChilcot reveals: Case for Iraq war made before weapon inspections',"It would be good to see that on the basis of the Chilcot report Tony Blair could potentially face prosecution for war crimes, Anne Machon, former British intelligence officer told RT Other experts also weighed in with their opinions Seven years later, and at a cost of 10 million (US$ 13 million), analysts are now busy pouring through the much anticipated 2 6 million word Chilcot report to better understand exactly what the government of then Prime Minister Tony Blair knew before it decided to follow the United States into what has been a monumental disaster for the Iraqi people No matter how damning  this Chilcot report is believed to be, it could be much worse, according to host of RT s Going Underground Afshin Rattansi RT:According to WikiLeaks, top UK and US officials have been discussing the consequences of the Chilcot inquiry for the two countries What can you tell us regarding this? Afshin Rattansi:We were talking about the UN Security Council; some believe the Chilcot report may lead to Britain leaving its position on the UN Security Council According to Sir John Chilcot, it seemed to be undermining the British government A cable from 2009 so this is after the terms of reference were agreed by Chilcot, and we have a cable dated September 22, 2009 addressed to Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State of the US, as well as the US ambassadors to Geneva, to Vienna, to New York, and Vienna presumably, because of weapons inspections In it, it clearly states that at a meeting with David Miliband, the Blairite Foreign Secretary, and a meeting with Jon Day, the Ministry of Defense s Director General, it says clearly that this American official addressing this secret cable to the US that there was a promise given by the British government that the UK had put measures in place to protect your interests during the UK enquiry into the causes of the Iraq war So no matter how damning some people believe this Chilcot inquiry report to be, it could conceivably be much worse The truth could be much, much worse RT:Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is under fire and under pressure over the Chilcot report Where is George W Bush these days? What do you think there will be a reaction from Washington to this report? AR:Of course the media will concentrate on individuals There were 254 Labour MPs some of them trying to overthrow the leader of the opposition here who voted for war So whether George W Bush gets off or not, or Tony Blair gets off or not, may be another matter But it is a vindication: from the first words of Sir John Chilcot at the press conference currently going on: he said that the case for war was made before weapons inspections  It is a vindication for people like government scientist David Kelly, who was driven to his death by the Labour government, who tried to expose him And other weapons inspectors who were constantly being undermined by a preconceived idea to invade Iraq regardless of what they were doing I should just add a little bit about journalists Let s remember the Director General of the state mandated BBC was sacked So journalists who are trying to do their job and uncover the kind of things that Chilcot has uncovered today after 7 years they were sacked Other people paid with their lives, and of course millions were bereaved, died and have been displaced by the Iraq war #Baghdadbleeds & mass murder stalks the land 2003#IraqWarcontinues by imperialism s proxy terrorists #Chilcotpic twitter com/7StITEswlI Political risk analystShwan Zulalsaid British families whose children died in the Iraq war will have a lot of questions for the government Why soldiers were led into a war, which was not based on evidence that Saddam posed a risk to UK citizens? RT:The report claims Blair deliberately exaggerated the threat and ignored warnings that invasion could strengthen terrorists Why do you think he did that? Shwan Zulal:The real motive is very clear from [George] Bush and [Tony] Blair before they went to war: they wanted to remove Saddam Hussein This is understandable At the time I did support the war As an Iraqi I suffered under Hussein, and I know how brutal the Saddam regime was However, when you look at the finding of this report it is very clear that Tony Blair obviously took those decisions based on flawed intelligence first of all, and secondly, he didn t really take advice For example, the joint intelligence committees were very clear in saying the Islamic extremists and Al Qaeda were one of the biggest threats after an invasion And 13 years later we can see Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) now in Iraq with the sort of advances they make and how they control vast swaths of Iraq and the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people The Americans failed in creating a harmonious society here in Iraq On the contrary they divided the nation; they introduced sectarianism within Iraqi politicians; and they put the foundation for a divided society in a divided country Saad Matlabi, deputy head ¯of Baghdad Council s Security Committee, told RT s Going Underground program RT:Are you surprised with the content of the report? Did you expect it to be this critical? SZ:This report is really about how decisions were taken in Whitehall in the buildup before and after the war; and how the war in Iraq was handled Let s not forget the 179 British servicemen who died in that war their families want answers They obviously want to know why their children were led into a war, which was not based on evidence that Saddam posed a risk to UK citizens The families want to know why the British soldiers were not adequately equipped For example, there were a lot of shortages in armor, and various other equipment for the military; the preparation was very short, the British military was not really prepared to go to that war And the Ministry of Defense pushed the agenda through and those families will have a lot of questions Business between American and British intelligence services behind the scenes will stay as usual, but politicians will have to make the right noises in response to the Chilcot report,Annie Machon, former British intelligence officer told RT RT:Tony Blair has already responded to the report by denying the accusations, but perhaps he genuinely thought he was acting in Britain s best interests by going to war? Anne Machon:I am sure he believes that However, the warning were very clear and they reported over decade ago that Baroness Eliza Manningham Buller, at the time the head of MI5, the UK domestic security service, had very clearly warned him that if Iraq were invaded, if Saddam Hussein were toppled, then, if there were indeed weapons of mass destruction or other munitions, they would fall into the hands of our potential terrorist enemies, thereby endangering British national security further That is proven to be true The response from MI5 has been at noted odds to the response of MI6 during the war on terror MI6 facilitated and gave and fed in false intelligence into that decision to go to war MI5 was warning against it And looking at the shambles that is now in Libya, where again we intervened, again a so called dictator was toppled, and again the rebels took power in the country, and there is now a civil war Again we all seeing that those are the weapons, which were available to the previous dictator and now are falling into the hands of our terrorist enemies, and not least ISIS, as well as Al Qaeda It is a complete mess every which way you look at it RT:Earlier, Blair did admit the operation in Iraq could have contributed to the rise of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) According to the Chilcot report, Blair was warned in advance that it would lead to the rise of terrorism around the world Why did he ignore the warning? AM:I think that is an answer that can be given only by Blair himself One can speculate that he wanted to step on the international stage by offering George Bush unqualified support in the invasion of Iraq; in prosecuting the war on terror That is indeed what the UK has done, apparently against its own national interests Now I do understand the pain of the families of the soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq I can understand the pain of the families of all those who are dead, misplaced, displaced and maimed in Iraq as well It would be lovely to see that on the basis of the Chilcot report Blair could potentially be opened to prosecution under war crimes the crime of aggression Iraq today is completely ruined Over a million of people were killed by the war; the infrastructure is destroyed Heath, education, agriculture, industry all destroyed We have one of the most corrupt regimes in the world based on a constitution imposed by the US and Britain on the Iraqi people You are talking about the society being threatened even more The war continues I don t think they planned anything and they didn t need to wait for Chilcot to pronounce it   Sami Ramadani, Iraqi born lecturer in sociology and a political exile from Saddam s regime who campaigned against US led sanctions and the invasion and occupation of Iraq, told RT s Going Underground RT:How will the report influence relations between the UK and one of its closest allies the United States AM:Politically it will have to be seen to have an impact That is the play that goes on within the international politics However, fundamentally there is very close cooperation between the intelligence agencies in the US and the intelligence agencies in the UK In fact, the relationship between the NSA [National Security Agency] and its British equivalent GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters] is probably the closest intelligence relationship in the world; it underpins the UKs so called special relationship with the US I think behind the scenes it will be business as usual, but the politicians will have to be seen to make the right sounds, the right noises in response to this report It is a shame the report didn t come out earlier Obviously it has been delayed for seven years During those seven years we have seen failed invasions of Libya and failed intervention in Syria as well The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/349710-chilcot-iraq-war-report/
"23 May, 2016",US society at crossroads ahead of 2016 presidential elections,"The 2016 electoral period appears to have the highest degree of polarization and division the country has seen since the Civil War of 1861 Derek Monroe is a writer/reporter and consultant based in Illinois, USA He has reported on international and US foreign policy issues from Latin America, Poland, Japan, Iraq, Ukraine, Sri Lanka and India His work appeared in Foreign Policy in Focus, Alternet, Truthout and Ohmynews, and has been published in over 20 countries Derek Monroe is a writer/reporter and consultant based in Illinois, USA He has reported on international and US foreign policy issues from Latin America, Poland, Japan, Iraq, Ukraine, Sri Lanka and India His work appeared in Foreign Policy in Focus, Alternet, Truthout and Ohmynews, and has been published in over 20 countries The highly charged national atmosphere brings out anger in people to the point of verbal and even physical aggression as they increasingly feel disfranchised by the American political system The attempt at unity by the Republicans following with the ascendancy of Donald Trump spells out the internal conflict, while the Democrats are faced with increasing internal pressure to deal with new accusations of criminality by Hillary Clinton (email and funding issues), not to mention its controversial hierarchy in the Electoral College politburo This is the first time in living memory the elites seem to be completely decoupled from their political base, whether on the general direction of the country or the socio economic policies that, by its own inertia, increase the divide between the rich and the rest The coronation of Donald Trump represents a de facto lack of credible authority that would end the increasing verbal attacks by the Republicans (within and without) on the rest that don t agree with them It goes beyond culture wars as the idea is the holy quest of identity, as to what it means to be an American and who gets to be one The goal posts of this game are constantly moving, reacting to the dog whistle politics influenced by incessant polling in a quest for the perfect angry pinata Increasingly, the Democrats are also being put on the same ride as Bernie Sanders; standing in the electoral polls is used as a lever for Hillary to become the winning horse, rigged with money and insider influence The illusion of democratic process is being undone before our eyes as freedom of choice is increasingly becoming freedom without it Meanwhile, the politics of identity is increasingly played on the wide field of civilization It is either us vs them and the darker, poorer, uneducated, and the louder it gets the more it is now referred to as the alien other As the winning one percent has realized it is time for some type of fundamental change while at the same time trying to avoid it in a lesser evil scenario In his phenomenal work, Zorn und Zeit ( Rage and Time ), German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk characterizes the emotion of rage as one of the major motivators of the human race Accordingly Sloterdijk alleged Judeo Christian conceptions of God as ultimately piggybacking on the feelings of rage and resentment, creating the metaphysical revenge banks These banks are now a powerful reservoir of power based on emotion and politics of identity which are now being used as the ultimate last resort of the rich, using them to have the masses vote against their self interest This trend is possible by the progressive marginalization of self awareness and shame as the most common denominator of societal glue The freedom from shame is a very specific type of freedom It reinforces the system of individual freedom that when looked at closely is actually a type of handicap, a freedom of choice held by an invisible chain that it is the dogma of neoliberal religion fueling the paradigm It all started with a system of education that is permeated with the notion of training vs public education It reinforces the status quo based on divisions of class while reducing students to mere products and imposing consumer freedom as a substitute for democracy This system is based on quantitative rather than qualitative characteristics so the idea of a college education does not warrant any major breakthroughs through intellectual or hierarchical thresholds but a mere conformity to the system s supposed technocratic values The educational and experience based development of consciousness has been reduced to the illusive point of self discovery within coordinates imposed from the outside As there are no role models on whom one can base a holistic approach to personality development, the artificial value added metrics of the business are added instead They are substitutes for real creativity while its disruptive features parade as values, vision and guarantors of the new world order The fakeness of this formula based on Hopium (Obama 2008) reveals itself rather quickly with students graduating with huge amounts of debt and few real prospects of employment The result is a classic neo feudalism of the successful few vs the overwhelming majority of losers Thus we have the apparently leaderless society of everyone against everyone making it the perfect scenario for covert societal control The implicit shamelessness is systemic and deliberate It shows itself as an application of brute force and power as it is attractive enough to create its own code of ethics and morality, often using the Judeo Christian ethos as its base It results in such abominations as gospel of prosperity manifesting itself as a real path to capitalist salvation while using the religious as a tool for self justification and a perverse form of self therapy Banks use this technique as a form of motivation for its employees who are in turn expected to get a profitable client and customer base, thus becoming the apostles of financial salvation The financial investment world has become a faith based proposition with a small disclaimer stating: the past results are not guarantors or benchmarks of future performance The competitiveness and ugliness of the politics also finds its reflection in our everyday lives It is a field of constant testing for decency Whether we are losing our jobs to overseas H1B visa holders or automation we are constantly told to retain composure and not take it personally as we were non persons In this way the new lines of compromise and shame are constantly being redrawn by the constantly changing rules of the game It is a simple game of survival based on family, credit, jobs and consumption that leads to a complete withdrawal from the public arena The latter becomes the reserve of the privileged few thus the public policy reflecting it It is a system of authoritarianism that will burn itself out from its own incompetence and inability to meet even the basic needs of its citizens; it will turn into new totalitarian hell It will be the totalitarianism without coordinates and convictions, a pure hell of efficiency built on one s own prospect of destiny We are now entering a period similar to Germany s Weimar Republic of 1932 It is just before the onslaught of darkness that took the country and then Europe into the abyss of war The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/344091-us-elections-crossroads-division/

if the US is the Empire of Chaos, Brazil has now gloriously reached the status of Sub Empire of Scoundrels Rousseff may be accused of serious economic mismanagement, and of being incapable of political articulation among the shark pool that is (immensely corrupt) Brazilian politics But she is not corrupt She made a serious mistake in fighting inflation, allowing interest rates to rise to an unsustainable level; so demand in Brazil dramatically dropped, and recession became the norm She is the (convenient) scapegoat for Brazil s recession She certainly may be blamed for not having a Plan B to fight the global recession Brazil essentially works on two pillars;

projects like the F 35 fighter jet She described the US encirclement of Russia as a Cuban missile crisis on steroids, and said the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact is creating a trade war with China right now  Nuclear weapons and energy All three candidates were adamantly opposed not just to nuclear weapons, but nuclear energy We don t need that, Moyowasifza Curry said, adding there were enough nuclear weapons in the world for the human race to commit collective suicide We really need a nuclear free world, said Mespley, explaining that he opposed nuclear energy because it gave legitimacy to the existence of nuclear weapons It s not only shameful, it s extremely dangerous that the US has been modernizing its nuclear weapons, said Stein, voicing opposition for Washington s abandonment of the ABM treaty How would the candidates respond to terror?@DrJillStein: stop the arming and the funding pic twitter com/IMQmEL84xE How to deal with terrorism We created every enemy we have by our actions and our behaviors, Moyowasifza Curry said, noting that domestic terrorism was just as dangerous as its international cousin She urged compatriots to reach out to allies in the Islamic world Mespley agreed, saying that perverted and corrupted Islam was behind terrorism, while authentic Muslims have been horrified by it More people were killed by toddlers since 9/11 than by so called Islamic terrorists, Stein argued Our wars in Iraq, Syria and Libya have fanned the flames of ISIS  Modern Islamic terrorism was created by the CIA and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s to fight the Russians in Afghanistan, she said Guns and violence We need to get automatic weapons off the streets and hold gun manufacturers and distributors accountable for violence, Stein argued as the debate on domestic policy issues kicked off with a question about gun control Moyowasifza Curry said she would outlaw and eliminate by decree guns within the first 100 days, if elected Mesplay acknowledged that this was the party stance, but said he personally supported Second Amendment rights in the face of a heavily armed US military acting like a predator across the planet  Mesplay went on to advocate a Green New Deal to create jobs, while promoting local self sufficiency as the way to go forward Stein pointed out that vast concentrations of wealth corrupt our political system, while Moyowasifza Curry denounced capitalism altogether I am a socialist, and capitalism is barbaric, Moyowasifza Curry said Food waste and social safety nets Moyowasifza Curry also denounced corporate welfare as criminal, and argued that companies which can t make a profit without taxpayer support don t deserve to be in business  Mesplay pushed for a universal agreed income, but noted it would require changing the infrastructure to prevent individuals from gaming the system All candidates agreed that industrialized food production has been creating problems, and advocated a focus on organic agriculture, local sustainability, and banning genetically modified organisms (GMOs) Feminism and police brutality They likewise agreed that feminism or post patriarchal values as Mesplay phrased it was a core value of the party Moyowasifza Curry referenced a Ghanaian proverb about educating women helping the entire community, while Stein said that reproductive rights were a human right off limits to government intrusion End the racist war on drugs, urged Stein, further advocating for release of nonviolent offenders imprisoned on drug charges Moyowasifza Curry, who wore a Black Lives Matter button, echoed that sentiment, adding that she would mandate sensitivity training for police officers The entire concept of whiteness was misconstrued, she said, a product of ignorance We need a cultural shift, to not have a militarized police force, Mesplay said, adding that he would establish a commission to document police killings Whistleblowers and secrets Whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden took great risks to expose the government s shadowy operations, and should be praised for it, Mesplay said Both of them, as well as Julian Assange, should be welcomed home heroes, argued Stein, because they revealed things American people desperately needed to know about  Moyowasifza Curry added she would give the whistleblowers a ticker tape parade in Washington, DC  Reigning in the Pentagon The $600 billion US military budget is actually understated, since it does not account for the costs of Veterans Affairs and the chronic traumas that exact a cost on the society as a whole, Mesplay argued He would transform the military s logistics capability to serve peaceful purposes Moyowasifza Curry agreed that the US military would be better used to build peace at home, advocating cutting the military in half and establishing the Department of Peace We can fix this we started it, we can stop it, Stein said, arguing that the US foreign policy based on economic and military domination has been absolutely catastrophic, resulting in failed states, mass refugee flows, and terrorism We have a trigger finger on an extremely bloated military, she added, saying that every dollar spent on clean energy would create three times more jobs than if spent on the military Campaign finance All of the candidates came out against corporate finance in politics, criticizing the current electoral system is outdated and in need of reform We won t get to 300 if we allow this buying of democracy, Moyowasifza Curry said, pointing out that 158 families account for the bulk of political donations in US elections She urged the passage of a constitutional amendment to end corporate personhood  Currently, corporations are super people that never die, Mespley noted, likewise opposed to the ruling Stein pointed out that Citizens United was not the only SCOTUS verdict corrupting the political process, and pointed to the incredible corrupting influence of the corporate media in this race, with the amount of coverage given to mainstream candidate Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Stein was the Green Party s presidential nominee in 2012 She is a medical doctor who has led initiatives promoting healthy communities, green economy and democracy She was the principal organizer for the Global Climate

Not really Let s see how the mechanism works, focusing on TPP s European twin With impeccable timing, almost simultaneously to Obama s Op Ed, Greenpeace Netherlandsleaked248 pages of classified TTIP documents that were to be re discussed last week by negotiators in New York There have been no less than 13 rounds of TTIP negotiations so far, over nearly three years Thedocuments negotiated in total secrecy since 2013 represent roughly two thirds of the latest negotiating text An array of detailed studies, likethisone, had been warning about the state of play The veil of secrecy ended up being the ultimate giveaway to TTIP s toxicity Before the Greenpeace Netherlands leak, EU elected representatives could only examine these documents under a police watch, in a secure room, without access to experts, and on top of it they could not discuss the content with anyone else Everything civil society across Europe for at least three years has been debating, and fearing, is confirmed; this is a sophisticated, toxic US led corporate racket, a concerted assault across the spectrum, from the environment and animal welfare to labor rights and internet privacy In a nutshell; it s all about the US corporate galaxy pushing the EU to lower or abase a range of consumer protections Hardball, predictably, is the name of the game Washington no less than threatened to block EU car exports to force the EU to buy genetically engineered fruits and vegetables In my travels in France, Italy and Spain over the past two years, I confirmed this to be the ultimate nightmare expressed by practitioners of top end artisanal agriculture Predictably, the lobbyist infested European Commission (EC) fiercely defends TTIP, stressing it could benefit the EU s economy by $150 billion a year, and raise car exports by 149 percent Obviously don t expect the EC to connect these car exports  to a US led GMO invasion of Europe At least some nations have finally woken up from their (corporate lobbyist induced) slumber The French Minister for Foreign Trade, Matthias Fekl, said negotiations over a bad deal  should stop He went straight to the point, blaming Washington s intransigence; There cannot be an agreement without France and much less against France  Perennially ineffectual President Francois Hollande, for his part, has threatened to block the deal altogether Three years ago Paris had alreadysecuredan exemption for the French film industry not to be gobbled up by Hollywood Now it s also about the crucial agriculture front Hollande said he would never accept the undermining of the essential principles of our agriculture, our culture, of mutual access to public markets  And what is the EC leading the negotiations on behalf of the EU doing? Pulling its predictable Trojan horse act; these are all alarmist headlines  and a storm in a teacup  Puzzled EU citizens, en masse, may question if this is really the way for the EC a bureaucratic Brussels behemoth to supposedly defend the rights of EU consumers Yet, infiltrated as it is by corporate lobbyism, the EC simply can t protect the EU s environmental and health standards, much more sophisticated than the US s, from a corporate America bent on meddling with the content of EU laws all along the regulatory line POTUS was heavily campaigning for TTIP last month in Germany POTUS still hopes he may have a deal in the bag before he leaves office in January 2017 White House spokesman Josh Earnest has tried to put on a brave face, saying the leaks will not have a material impact on the negotiations Wrong; they will as they are mobilizing public opinion all across the EU David Cameron, in the UK, is also in a bind He s fiercely pro TTIP But Obama has already warned; this means Brexit is a no no Club Med nations, for their part, are leaning against All 28 EU member nations plus the European Parliament would have to ratify TTIP if a deal is eventually reached TPP, for its part, has been negotiated But it has not been approved by the US Congress (nor by Pacific nations) The approval process has gone nowhere In fact it will be up to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump Trump arguably is oblivious to TPP s details; but considering the deal is being heavily championed by Obama, Trump may go against it A case can be made that both TPP and TTIP vow to distort markets, in Europe and Asia; prop up (US) monopolies; transfer jobs to slave labor markets (in the case of parts of Asia); trample on intellectual property rights (in the case of the EU); facilitate tax evasion; and ultimately transfer more wealth from the many to the 0 00001 percent And this leads us to how Hillary Clinton the Wall Street/US establishment candidate views both TPP and TTIP Well, she supported both NAFTA and CAFTA, approved under Bill Clinton in the 1990s As Secretary of State, she lobbied for the Panama trade deal And, crucially, she has always treated the TPP as the gold standard  No wonder; this is the trade arm of the pivoting to Asia  she s been so fond of a Pacific trade deal that excludes China, which happens to be the top trade partner of most Asian nations Moreover, those by now famous Goldman Sachs speeches are increasingly being seen as payments for services rendered (and promised) by Hillary Clinton to the 0,0001 percent, who are, of course, in favor of global corporate America expansion Things we ve learned from the#TTIPLeaks:1 We re being sold down the river by our reps in the EU @WarOnWanthttps:// tdotco /CWH0smP0kY Yet it ain t over till the November ballot sings Hillary now faces serious scrutiny by working class voters in the US So no wonder, in another flip flopping masterpiece, she s now leaning towards describing herself as opposing both TPP and TTIP Still, TPP at least may be approved during the post election lame duck session of the US Congress As for TTIP, it s now mired in Walking Dead zone Talk about what it takes for the Obama administration to imprint its trade legacy  in the history books; to keep blackmailing Europeans and Asians alike as if it was just a lowly Mob extortion racket The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/341801-ttip-eu-obama-us-elections/
"22 Apr, 2016",Awarded for WHAT? 5 very awkward intâl prizes as Germanyâs Merkel honored over EU migrant crisis,"As German Chancellor Angela Merkel receives a European medal honoring her achievements in the freedom from fear  while tackling Europe s worst migrant crisis since WWII, RT looks back at other controversial awards given out to international leaders Merkel received the International Four Freedoms Medal from the Netherlands based Roosevelt Foundation on Thursday The German Chancellor was honored for her great moral leadership, promoting the four freedoms famously articulated by then US President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear Opening borders to large numbers of refugees has arguably been the most momentous decision during Merkel s 10 years in office, which sparked controversy and tension between Berlin and Germany s federal states Critics also questioned Merkel s merits where freedom of speech was involved, reminding of her decision toallowthe prosecution of a German comedian who wrote a crude poem about Turkish President Erdogan READ MORE: 500,000 unregistered migrants roaming Germany report Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has collected a clutch of international awards honoring his global legacy in dealing with the world s problems Despite being responsible for involving Britain into the 2003 Iraq war, which among other problems caused the deaths of thousands of civilian children, in 2014 the US arm of Save the Children recognized Blair for his role in making poverty history The Global Legacy Award caused widespread criticism, with hundreds of Save the Children staff signing an internal protest letter calling the decision morally reprehensible and inappropriate Over 100,000 more signed an online petition, urging the award to be revoked READ MORE: Tony Blair deceived top ministers over Iraq invasion new memoir Blair also received another US award from the hands of former US President Bill Clinton in 2010 He got the Liberty Medal, awarded to honor men and women of courage and conviction who strive to secure the blessings of liberty to people around the globe The US Secretary of State under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger was among the most disputable award winners ever Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, despite his alleged involvement in a campaign of political repression in Latin America, known as Operation Condor, the US s active support for the Pinochet coup in Chile in 1972, as well as US bombing campaigns in Cambodia The choice of the Nobel Prize winner was widely mocked, with critics saying the award has made political satire obsolete French President FranÃ§ois Hollande came under fire from human rights groups after he awarded Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia s interior minister, with the Order of LÃ©gion d Honneur, France s highest civil honor, for efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremism last month The decoration sparked ire among activists who slammed the Gulf state s abysmal human rights track record and the prince s personal complicity in the common Saudi practice of mass executions as interior minister As Saudi human rights activists, we have documented several instances where terrorism laws have been used against various sectors of peaceful civil society, including lawyers, protestors, activists and some even prosecuted for tweets, wrote Ali Adubisi, director of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR), while criticizing Holland s choice of a prestigious honor recipient We believe the value of such an award has been undermined and that the human rights records of individuals must be considered for receiving such an award, he added The human rights advocate pointed out that on the same day the ceremony held, Shia Muslim opposition activist Makki al Orayedh was reportedly tortured to death in detention some 390 km from Saudi Arabia s capital Riyadh with officials insisting that he died of deep seated fear, Press TV reported In September 2015, the UN revealed a no less surprising decision to appoint Faisal bin Hassan Trad, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, a chair of the key human rights panel of the UN Human Rights Council despite open criticism from reputed human rights groups such as UN Watch In 2014, Bahrain s National Institution for Human Rights and Ombudsman for the Interior Ministry were chosen by the EU as recipients of Chaillot Prize for the Promotion of Human Rights in the Arab Gulf region The prize was said to have marked the remarkable efforts and work for the promotion and protection of human rights At the same time, Bahrain has been repeatedly accused by various human rights organization brutally torturing political prisoners, including with electric shocks and sexual abuse These practices violate Bahrain s obligations as a state party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and other international treaties, and contravene the prohibition of torture in Bahrain s constitution and its penal code, Human Rights Watch reported in 2015 The controversial Nobel Committee decision to bestow a peace award on US President Barack Obama in 2009 has even faced a formal investigation into the selection process after a subsequent public outcry and repeated complaints from prominent Norwegian peace researcher Fredrik Heffermehl Do you see Obama as a promoter of abolishing the military as a tool of international affairs? the scholartoldAP in 2012, accusing the committee members of bias President Obama received the distinguished award in 2009 for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples, with the Committeestatingthat only rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world s attention and given its people hope for a better future  If there were any dim hopes that Obama, freshly sworn into the office, would immediately put an end to the US military campaign in Afghanistan, they were too optimistic from the start A week before delivering a speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama announced the US would send extra 33,000 troops to the country Further events proved that Obama is indeed an unlikely candidate to be awarded for promoting peace and international security In 2011, he ordered military strikes on Libya following enforcement of a no fly zone  by the UN Resolution No 1973 The ensuing military campaign resulted in Muammar Gaddafi s brutal assassination and the country s descending into the chaos of civil war Meanwhile in Afghanistan, the departure of the remaining US contingent has been put off in the wake of a resurgence by the Taliban In 2014, Obama almost ventured into a new military invasion as tensions around the Syrian crisis soared The diplomatic maneuvering from Moscow, which offered a solution by persuading President Bashar Assad to abandon his chemical weapons stockpile, might have saved the US citizens from another costly war The US still got stuck in Iraq and Syria, leading a bombing campaign against Islamic State, and arming and training anti Assad rebels, despite utter failures in the latter The chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee, Thorbjorn Jagland, has in vain urged Obama to consider returning the award In contrast to the controversy over Obama s award, the Peace Prize has been won by much celebrated winners, including US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King, Jr (1964); Soviet human rights and anti nuclear activist Andrei Sakharov (1975); Missionary and anti poverty campaigner Mother Theresa (1979); imprisoned Myanmar politician Aung San Suu Kyi (1991); and Nelson Mandela, the first ANC president of post apartheid South Africa (1993) Mahatma Gandhi, the campaigner for Indian independence and pioneer of non violent struggle, was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize, but never received it In 1948, a year after his assassination, the Nobel Committee decided not to award the Peace Prize, declaring that there was no

Mixed up with Google and the US State Department in a project to sway Syrian officials to betray President Assad? Now, if I told you how many articles a day I read about Russia, you d probably call me a saddo and, with good reason, tell me to get a life However, I like to get everyone s point of view, even people I don t agree with or don t consider legitimate Russia experts As a result, I wind up consuming copious anti RT rants weekly So numerous are they, that some people appear to make a living out of writing them That means I have to break my rule and digest the forbidden fruit of whataboutism here Let s cast our minds back to 2014 The Ukrainian Civil War is raging The countries eastern regions are revolting against the US backed regime installed after the Maidan Coup  Imagine that, amidst all this, RT hooks up with the Russian Foreign Ministry and Yandex (Russia s largest search engine) to produce an interactive tool pressuring Russian speaking Ukrainians to defect to the rebel side Given that Russian is the first language of almost everyone in eastern and southern Ukraine, this would have been reasonably influential As people tend to adopt a herd mentality in times of crisis, highlighting defections in Donbas and Lugansk could feasibly have provoked copycats in places like Kharkov, Nikolaev and Odessa In this scenario, a couple of years later, somebody hacks Sergey Lavrov s email servers and an email is published from his private account outlining the plan? How does the Western media, the State Department and the EU react? Does the Atlantic Council call for RT to lose its broadcast license in America?

"5 Mar, 2016",'US won't pressure NATO member Turkey over dictatorial behavior',"As police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds protesting outside the headquarters of the opposition Zaman newspaper in Istanbul on Friday, RT discussed with experts media persecutions in Turkey READ MORE: RT reporter teargassed in Istanbul as Zaman take over protest enters 2nd day RT:With the latest takeover of an opposition media source, why has such force been used in the situation like this? Gerry Sussman, professor from Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning:It appears that it is just another act of repression against the media in Turkey, it is a pattern It is called an insult case where the opposition is treated as insulting as if it is a personal relationship between the media and President Erdogan And that doesn t speak well of what purports to be a democracy And what immediately strikes me about it is the double standard with which the US and British press and their respective governments are treating Turkey vis Ã  vis how they treat, for example, Russia and President Putin This double standard is really outstanding And the broader implication is the coalition of forces that the US has organized on its side versus the coalition of forces that Russia has contributed to with Syria and Iran and Lebanon And this is the way in which this is characterized: the Putin government and President Putin himself is disrespected in most of the American media and in the political sphere including the leading political candidates for presidential office for this year And it is just striking how they have this disrespectful regard for the President of Russia, but really have a hands off or just not paying attention whatsoever to what s going on in Turkey   So, that is really what stands out As to what precisely is going on It is clearly not representative of what anybody would consider a serious democracy The media, of course, is really important and it also suggests that the court system in Turkey apparently has no regard for the free press Richard Becker, anti war activist, told RT: On the one hand, we have this action by the Turkish government against the newspaper that has been critical of Erdogan and is being taken over and apparently its editorial policy changed in a pro Erdogan direction And on the other, we have a statement coming from the State Department that they find this troubling Of course, this is just for PR purposes, nothing will really change, Turkey is considered by Washington and the Pentagon to be a critical ally  RT:It s not the first opposition newspaper to be oppressed by the government Why is Turkey systematically pursuing them? GS:It is obvious that they will not tolerate an opposition If the Western press were looking at this in a normal way, they would say that this is an act of a dictatorial type of leadership, not that of a democracy That should be very clear and that should raise really serious questions about American and NATO s relationship with a country that disregards the fundamentals of a free press and of democracy RT:The US State Department has criticized Turkey s actions today Will Turkey take heed? GS:My expectation is that they are not going to listen to the US unless there is a lot of pressure And I don t think the presidential administration is going to put a lot of pressure, just like they don t put a lot of pressure on other recalcitrant allies that repress the media Just sort of a public statement perhaps by the president of the US, President Obama and that would be the end of it But I don t think Turkey is going to pay much attention to it and I think that gradually countries in the Middle East are pulling away from US influence I think it speaks to the really limited power and influence that the US actually has over the region But it raises more fundamental questions about US relations with Turkey and about the whole constitution of that alliance structure of Turkey with Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf States I think these are the larger questions that it is going to invoke in the political process I don t think you are going to hear much about this really in a critical way, certainly not from the Republican candidates for office this year, or from somebody like Hillary Clinton who has been known to be quite hawkish on US foreign policy more so than even President Obama I don t think the US will act aggressively and try to put pressure on the Turkish government And that will be a clear signal to the Erdogan government and him personally that he can do what he wants and the US will remain faithful allies the way they are with other repressive regimes in the region Yuksel Serindag, a member of the Kurdish American Society, commented on Turkish government s crackdown on Zaman newspaper: This is one of the main newspapers in Turkey which has links to the Gulen society [a pacifist pro Islam movement], whose cleric head lives in the US I think this is the last leg of the crackdown on that society They have been cracking down on their followers among the police and judiciary, but now it is the Gulen s media  RT:Do you see this as another example of Erdogan cracking down on the freedom of speech? Ajamu Baraka, human rights activist:Of course, it is It is another outrageous incident brought about by the Turkish authorities It is something that has been unfolding in that country or intensifying since last Sunday It is clearly the continuation of an ongoing human rights crisis in Turkey There is no justification for cracking down on a newspaper, for limiting free speech But we have seen over the last half a year or more that Erdogan is committed to undermining democracy and eliminating all expressions of opposition RT:What could be done now to alleviate the problems with the press in Turkey? AB:I think there needs to be a consistent loud voice coming from the nations that pretend to be the upholders of democracy and human rights Basically, Turkey being a friend of the West, and the West that pretends to uphold democracy, those states should roundly condemn this latest incident But we see that even the US government says they are troubled by what happened in Turkey But the real troubling aspect of this is that Western nations have allowed Turkey, the Saudis, and for themselves to operate above international law So, what we see with the Erdogan regime is basically a new configuration in terms of the complete rejection of the constraints of international law when it comes to a state or a government or a party attempting to advance its particular interest Ronald Suny, professor of Social and Political History at the University of Michigan, said: It seems to be at the moment in Turkey a concerted effort by the Erdogan government to end the democratic reforms that that government in fact instituted some 10 years ago This is an incredibly dangerous move on their part because it is leading to a kind of civil war situation in Turkey  RT:The US State department has issued some critical comments about Erdogan What is your view on that? Experts say there were too superficial AB:I agree with that assessment that basically they were superficial that if the US authorities were really opposed to the crackdown on democracy in Turkey, they would make their positions well known But we see that not only do we have the crackdown against a newspaper, we see this increasing militarization of life in Turkey including the militarization taking place on the border between Turkey and Syria And we have to put this in context One of the reasons why Erdogan regime is cracking down on dissent is because of the massive opposition the many citizens in Turkey have regarding its policies in Syria The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/334640-turkey-erdogan-crackdown-zaman/

Radio (NPR), America s premiere radio organization, announced that the US military may have bombed the Afghan hospital and the resulting casualties may have resulted in collateral damage This despite the fact that it had already been confirmed on the ground by foreign media There was also the UN official s declaration that if the attack was intentional it will be regarded as a war crime The careful recitation of Pentagon s talking points signifies something bigger than it appears at first glance Suddenly, reports of civilian casualties and confirmed unconfirmed reports of Russian airstrikes on US allied Free Syrian Army dominated the US airwaves Strangely enough, missing are the reports coming out Syria and Turkey about the massive wave of dislocation caused by the Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda, some of which wereequippedcourtesy of US taxpayers and facilitated by strategic choices made by the Pentagon According to the recent congressional hearings that were buried as quickly as they came out, the $500 million spent on the FSA are as missing as the army it was supposed to train However, a few weeks back there was a very prescriptive narrative of unfolding events at Palmyra, Syria where the lamentations over the destruction of Roman ruins took precedent over its population and the carnage visited upon them There was virtually no mention of the concentration of IS forces three days before the attack and the US backed coalition s premeditated refusal to bomb it Palmyra would have been saved, and the devastation that followed avoided The striking contrast with Libya s Benghazi air attack that stopped Gaddafi s armor a few years earlier was not lost on people who followed the situation as it developed It appears the West has already decided genocidal and ruthless IS a better alternative than the authoritarian and brutal Assad regime, which happened to be Russia s ally However, looking at the US media coverage one enters a world of parallel reality where the perception ruled by misinformation and contextual omission is everything Just as Putin listed his intention to fight IS, the storm of critical coverage erupted into blaming Russia for the current situation in Syria This is the world where the Arab Spring, both Iraq wars, Libya, Afghanistan and even 9/11 never happened As the mainstream commercial media pontificates on the meaning of the America s loss of supremacy in the region, the US public, i e non commercial media, including the NPR, went into analyzing the news to arrive at the forgone conclusion that one country s anti terrorist action is another one s aggressive and civilian casualties filled intervention In this mold, the modus operandi is based on inviting guests from thought farms that include a wide variety of outfits from Brookings to the Orwellian sounding Foundation for Defense of Democracies (ex CIA director R James Woolsey s project) Add the amazing unity of thought to the mix of preconceived notions and you have a product worth selling The NPR is especially good at this as the list of its invited guests come from institutions that almost all have at one point received or receive funding from Ford, Gates, Rockefeller foundations, as well as front and interest groups representing in many cases corporations that have business interests in the region Naturally, none of that is always disclosed to the listeners Ironically, more often than not the experts are the very people who worked at the administrations of Bill Clinton, George H W Bush, George W Bush and Barack Obama and who in many cases rooted for Afghani and Iraqi adventurism from the beginning Furthermore, it is even more ironic that these are the same arbiters of truth now as they were then The supposed analysis based on new and improved curveball testimonies is next presented in form of a legal like case before the jury of watchers/listeners as each side is supposed to present its own conclusions while not letting the facts get in a way of good story Last week, the NPR affiliated and Boston based WBUR s On Point program featured two experts who more less agreed on Russian culpability in Syria without offering any tangible outcome beyond the tired rhetoric of Assad must go and the situation will work itself out politically afterwards The idea of political settlement, i e negotiations with terrorists whose Islamofascist Caliphate precludes existence of civilized order, is not only absurd; it is a slap in the face to the American families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks It is also a cynical ploy to deflect any responsibility for genocidal carnage that would result in Assad s fall as the zero sum game scenario would undoubtedly unfold due to the wishes of our State Dept planners and strategists When I called the On Point program several times in the past and presented my views contrary to their expert presentation, I was always put on long hold and subsequently disconnected The next time around, however, I was able to call in and present my view under an alias, stating that contrary to the presented narrative the issue in Syria did not start with quelling of the demonstration in Daraa in 2011, as presented, but around 2005 when the US decided on policy for regime change I quoted several WikiLeaks documents to prove the point The producer who took the call instructed me to leave out this info as not to challenge the guests and instead pose a question that can be answered within a framework of the program I went ahead and quoted the documents anyway and as it happens the response was nonsense The style of non confrontation, while keeping the integrity of the presented narrative, is a hallmark of NPR as in the end the brand is more important than the substance it is made of Ironically, despite many challenges in spinning and manipulating the facts, the methodology of inviting people who discredited themselves in the past (Iraq, Afghanistan, WMDs) and were wrong then and now is alive and well It is grotesque to the point of being unbelievable On Sept 28, WBUR s Here and Now host Robyn Young in outrage and disbelief over Russia s establishment of an intelligence office in Baghdad She reacted by announcing on the air that this should not have happened as: I thought Iraq was ours The segment has since been removed and replaced with a different interview, making it sound like something from the Soviet Union s playbook And overall this is the organization that asks its listening public for contributions According to the last available report by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (F A I R) from 2004, over 80 percent of NPR reporting staff came from news companies such as New York Times, Washington Post and Wall St Journal This cultural characteristic is reflected in a very narrow expertise based on previous conditioning and it ushered the new era of generalist excellence That means a skill set that is good enough at everything and excellent at nothing The cultural and organizational bias that was transplanted with migration of the corporate mindset is now permeating the NPR as it has been assimilated into prevailing Washingtonian elitist worldview on economy, society and politics Thus listening to the stuff produced by NPR in the Beltway, New York and Boston produces a sensation of complete disconnect to what Americans are feeling and expect in their news, resulting into migration to the internet based platforms Increasingly they want the unvarnished truth Instead the revolving door of NPR CEOs that hailed from corporate sector, New York Times, Voice of America (government funded propaganda) and the latest in commercial television is indicative of NPR s split personality and reduction of its abilities and capabilities to a mere propaganda tool The business of propaganda masquerading as news is lucrative, especially when one doing it is on the inside track According to the last IRS fiscal year disclosure (ending 9/30/2014), NPR s CEO makes more than the US president with overall compensation listed at $756,575 Other stars of the NPR universe are also well paid, including its flagship morning program s Steve Inskeep at $405,818, Michelle Norris at $349,177, Robert Siegel at $409,689 and Scott Simon, who is able to pull a cool $389,609 All are working the 40 hour week as listed on the IRS disclosure form to which most of contributing listeners can relate to although on quite a different pay scale, to say the least The money has been a honey trail of the NPR game since its visibly less well off listening public is regularly harassed by its affiliated stations for money In Chicago, begging for money is getting increasingly aggressive and grotesque making, it sound like some type of on the air BINGO game punctuated with pledges and featuring prizes big and small This forced begging and humiliation of the presenters and reporters pitching in to this sorry spectacle of desperation is truly sad It resembles a relationship between McDonalds and its franchisees while the dollar menu of ideas is being constantly updated for a higher price bracket that will be picked up by corporate donors Slogans such as $5 Friday bring carnival idiot like qualities to the game called listener and increasingly corporate supported radio which is probably not surprising givenNPR s largest donationgiven by the fortune created by the Happy Meal The self sustained propaganda machine of pyramid proportions has its up and downs as it wascaughtwith its pants down last year in yet another scandal This raises more than just the question of transparency, but NPR s real purpose Why is the web of influencers and influenced not disclosed? Why doesn t it mention personal relationships of its staff with the establishment it is supposed to cover and not serve? During the Iraq invasion, for example, its chief reporter in Baghdad was Anne Garrels, who also happened to be a spouse of a CIA operative In 2007, the NPR came under criticism after Garrels used information that wasobtained by torturefor her story During the interview with her interpreter/translator, it was even stated that the Iraqi authorities suspected her to work for the CIA However, the most blatant conflict of interest that is tolerated comes in shape of NPR analyst Cokie Roberts In the 1980s, she covered Guatemala during a period of widespread human rights violations by the US supported military junta During an interview with Diana Ortiz, a nun who worked with the poor and was subsequently kidnapped, raped and tortured, Roberts contested the nun s version of events that took place Ortiz alleged that an American was among her tormentors and later her version of events prevailed in court in a lawsuit against a Guatemalan general she held responsible for her treatment Roberts also came out strongly in favor of the Trans Pacific Partnership, despite the fact that it will hurt many working families in the US It was later revealed that Patton Boggs, Washington DC based lobbying and law firm run by her brother Tom Boggs, was hired by the Guatemalan government to promote a positive image of the country Ditto with the TPP, as Patton Boggs was one of the chief lobbying groups pushing for it Ms Roberts goes on producing her 4 minute weekly segments for the NPR to this day as if nothing ever happened The bias in the NPR reporting goes beyond dollars and cents as it is infused with ideology as well In 2012 in the wake of destruction by Hurricane Sandy, the NPR programming featured a common sense solution to the shortages of commodities such as gasoline that affected the stricken public Make gas $25 a gallon and the lines will automatically disappear was the ex cathedra view of its invited economic experts whose views resonate with increasingly elitist top NPR echelon At the same time radio stations that broadcast the mind numbing pseudo science as often referred to on NPR s Hidden Brain segment, are increasingly employing unpaid interns for its everyday tasks As only the rich can afford to be an unpaid intern in New York, Boston or Washington, the culture of elitism lives on and decides what is good for the unwashed listening masses On the economic front the NPR s corporate donor class also has influence on how the issues are covered when it comes to corporate scandals as well The daily unrelenting push to make Volkswagen a daily pinata pales in comparison with coverage of economic issues that deserve not only a balanced and proportional coverage but basic fairness It is amazing that VW gets a bazooka treatment in both time and scope of reporting while the fraud perpetrated by GM one of the NPR s biggest donors in its ignition switch gate was given very shy coverage regardless of the fact that it cost 124 lives At the same time, the happy team at NPR s own Planet Money keeps on rolling in a framework of peddling corporate messaging to idiots, while its ownquestionable past and recorddoesn t seem to present any challenges going forward or even backward Nothing represents history of manipulation of the US media better than a quote from great American journalist A J Liebling stating that: freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one Americans are increasingly looking for answers and explanations outside of the North American mainstream media mirage that has only served itself to their detriment As for National Propaganda Radio, as many have derisively come to call the NPR, it needs to look to no further than Norway in 2017 as it ends the FM broadcasting Silence is better than the lies NPR in Washington declined a request for an interview regarding its programming WBUR in Boston did not return repeated requests for an interview about its programming LISTEN MORE: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novostiâ, 2005â2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/317615-us-media-world-propaganda/
"21 Aug, 2015",Putin goes to Crimea â but whereâs the Western outrage?,"It s almost eighteen months since the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly in a democratic referendum to join the Russian Federation President Putin visited Crimea, an event that was greeted with an unexpected Western media reaction is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Think back to March 2014, when the Crimean referendum took place The condemnation of Russia was intense Putin paid a visit to Crimea in May of that year following the annexation This triggered a tough response from Washington Crimea belongs to Ukraine and we don t recognize of course the illegal and illegitimate steps by Russia in that regard, declared US State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki Putin s visit to Crimea this week when he took a dive in a mini submarine to explore Byzantine era wreckage off Crimea s Black Sea coast was noticeably different There were jibes about Putin looking like a Bond villain; there were jokes about him looking for signs of the ruble; there were also references to the Kursk submarine disaster, which took place fifteen years earlier Anti Putin activists claim President Putin keeps doing stunts in submarines so search engines find fewer references to Kursk sub tragedy However, Ukraine s President Poroshenko s fierce condemnation of the visit he called it a challenge to the civilized world  seemed to fall on deaf ears, as none of the major Western leaders criticized Putin s trip to the annexed peninsula This lack of outrage was mirrored in the Western MSM coverage Sky News referred to Putin as daring CNN in its coverage of the event used Sevastopol, Crimea as the locator and not Ukraine (though they did state on their website that Crimea was Ukrainian territory ) Putin s visit was described elsewhere as controversial , but that s about as far as it went How much should one read in to all of this? The muted reaction to Putin s visit is not the only sign that things could be calming down Crimea has already been visited by a delegation of French MPs from Nicolas Sarkozy s Republican Party Italian Parliamentarians have announced plans to visit It s been reported that Polish MPs aremulling a tripto the peninsula, as are MPs from Germany s progressive Die Linke party It s ludicrous to think that they re all going there just to bring back some cheap cigarettes I think that the French parliamentarian s trip was a right thing to do Being elected by the people it was their duty to tell and show the official French authorities, politicians and the society as a whole what is really going on in Crimea right now This is a correct and demonstrative decision, Die Linke s Alexander Neu said The very fact that delegations of Western politicians are going and planning to go to Crimea tells us that they don t think it will cost them domestic popularity which is revealing in itself It shows that you can win political points on the Crimea issue in Europe It s not just politicos who are making their way to the peninsula, but music stars too American rock star Joe Lynn Turner, a former vocalist with Rainbow and Deep Purple, arrived in Crimea this week to give a series of concerts I know the truth lives here And I believe right now, this time Russia is going to be the great power that it already has been and that good always overcomes evil, Turnertold reporters I was warned I could be banned in Europe [for giving concerts in Crimea] but I am a rebel, I have always been a rebel and I will always stay a rebel I do not care what they say  I ve listened to every leader in the world The only one telling the truth is Putin, Turner said Also this week, the Italian tenor Federico Lepre of La Scala, Milan, performed in Yalta in Crimea with Russian singer Natalia Pavlova Colantoni of the Moscow State Conservatory The hope of the neocons that a strict Western boycott of Crimea would be observed has clearly not been realized Even though visiting the province doesn t necessarily mean endorsement of it being part of Russia it does show cracks in the hard line approach Singers, literally and metaphorically, are walking away from the West s chorus of condemnation Here s why it s happening For a start, the neocons argument, which goes something like, Crimea s annexation by Russia proves that Putin is the new Hitler, never really gained much traction certainly not among the general public Such a position was fatally weakened by the fact that Crimea was part of Russia between 1783 and 1954 (when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Khrushchev) and the fact that the majority of people who live there are, er, Russians You don t have to be a hardcore Russian nationalist with the Russia flag tattooed on your biceps to acknowledge that Russia does have pretty strong claims to the province Western journalists who do know a bit of regional history have undermined the neocon cause Peter Hitchens, a columnist for Britain s Mail on Sunday newspaperwrote A (not so brief) history of Crimea that provided some much needed historical background He also highlighted Western double standards on the Crimean referendum inanother pieceentitled, Why don t we want democracy and self determination for Crimea? In The Guardian, Seumas Milne, in anarticleentitled, The clash in Crimea is the fruit of Western expansion, wrote that: Western denunciations of Russian intervention in Crimea have reached new depths of self parody  READ MORE: Kissinger: Breaking Russia has become objective for US In the Sunday Telegraph, in December 2014, Christopher Bookerwrote: Quite one of the oddest and most frightening stories of the year has been the ludicrous and persistent misrepresentation in the West of the reason for the tragic shambles unfolding over Russia and Ukraine This has been presented as wholly the fault of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, compared by Hillary Clinton and the Prince of Wales to Hitler, for his annexing of Crimea it was entirely predictable that Russia and the ethnic Russians of eastern Ukraine would respond as they have done So, too, was the wish of the vast majority of Crimeans, 82 percent of them Russian speakers, to rejoin the country of which they were part for most of two centuries  The political context surrounding the return of Crimea to Russia also weakened the Russophobes case Let s not forget Crimea would still be part of Ukraine today had it not been for the Western sponsored toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev in February 2014 Crimea s referendum was a direct consequence of a regime change which Western leaders welcomed That regime change shattered the consensus under which the country had been governed since the end of the Soviet Union, and which reflected the divisions in the country The basis of that consensus was that democratic election results would be respected, and that the leaders of Ukraine would also make compromises on foreign policy orientation maintaining friendly relations with both Russia and the West and not going out of their way to antagonize either The consensus also meant respecting the full language and other rights of Ukraine s minorities All that was shattered by what happened in February 2014 Ukraine s Russian population felt threatened by the ousting of a President and a government they had largely supported and in particular were concerned over the prominent role that virulently anti Russian far right groups played in the so called democratic uprising READ MORE: US boxer Roy Jones Jr asks for Russian passport over cup of tea with Putin in Crimea Regardless of whether or not we regard the referendum of March 2014 as legal or illegal, constitutional or unconstitutional, it s easy to understand why the majority of people of Crimea decided that with neo Nazis on the rampage and a fiercely anti Russia administration in power in Kiev, it was time to say dosvedanya to Ukraine and return to Mother Russia The case for regarding Crimea s return to Russia as the most heinous of crimes has also not been helped by the observable fact that those who cried most loudly about how outrageous Crimea s annexation was, were also cheerleaders for the illegal invasion of Iraq Asked which was worse illegally invading a sovereign state on the basis of whopping big lie (WMDs) in order to grab its resources and extend your regional hegemony or a province retuning to a country it had been part of for the best part of two centuries after a referendum then all but the wild eyed inhabitants of Planet Neocon would say the former Let s not forget too that up to one million have lost their lives following the illegal Shock and Awe invasion of Iraq while the heinous annexation of Crimea that had the West s endless war lobby foaming at the mouth, was relatively bloodless with only one Ukrainian soldier unfortunately killed Today, three positions on Crimea can be discerned We can take the line that there the return of the province was entirely legitimate The referendum was democratic and represented the will of the people It couldn t be unconstitutional, because violent toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev meant that the old Ukrainian constitution was effectively torn up We can take the neocon line that holding a referendum was an act of aggression on a par with the Nazis attacking Poland/Czechoslovakia/Low Countries, etc and was a sign that Russian imperialism threatens the entire world (unlike the benign liberal invasions, oops, interventions, against sovereign states that the US and its allies have engaged in over the past 20 years and which have, er brought so much peace and stability to the Middle East and beyond) Or we can take a third position, which is the one I d say reflects where quite a few Western politicians are now, even though they might not openly admit it for fear of being branded Putin appeasers This position is: While we believe Ukraine s territorial integrity should have been maintained, it s hardly worth risking world war three over to get a historical province of Russia, populated by Russians to return to Ukraine and we need to try and get things back to normal  The reality is Crimea is now part of Russia again and no amount of neocon rage will change this European businesses and particularly manufacturing companies are losing out over the anti Russian sanctions and would like to see them lifted There is no real appetite outside of Russophobic circles to push things further A new Crimean war is highly unlikely It s also important to point out that the West whether it likes it or not needs Putin s cooperation on a number of issues, particularly in the Middle East The nuclear deal with Iran was only achieved with the Kremlin s help If Western leaders are serious about defeating ISIS (admittedly a big if considering how much Western powers and their regional allies have enabled ISIS), then Russia assistance will be crucial In the words of that well known left wing peacenik Henry Kissinger: For the West the demonization of Putin is not a foreign policy it s an alibi for the absence of one  Crimea remains subject to harsh western sanctions and is likely to be referred to as illegally annexed for quite some time yet In March, the US vowed to maintain sanctions as long as Russia s occupation continued Nevertheless, the muted reaction to Putin s visit this week must have made the neocons and those who do want to risk WW3 over Crimea rather concerned that things are gradually changing The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the

"8 Jun, 2015",Intervention in Libya will lead to a spread of WMD - intâl relations expert,"From Kosovo to Afghanistan, from Iraq to Libya the West comes in, posing as a savior, its troops bringing democracy and peace upon the troubled nations And yet, Libya is in ruins, Iraq is in a war for survival and Afghanistan is swarming with radicals and drug lords Has the policy of intervention brought anything except blood and chaos? And who is going to fix what has been broken by reckless invasions? Is humanitarian intervention  even possible or it s just a pretty cover up for cynical politics? We ask these questions to international relations expert, associate professor at the Lyndon B Johnson school of Public Affairs at the University of Texas Alan Kuperman is on Sophie&Co today Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Alan Kuperman, author, associate professor at the Lyndon B Johnson school of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, welcome to the show, it s great to have you with us today Now, as Hillary Clinton, the then U S secretary of State put it: we came, we saw, he died  now, she was obviously talking about the toppling of Gaddafi and Libyan bombing campaign Can you really just drop some bombs, give out arms and then leave is that what passes for a victory? Alan Kuperman:Oh no, as I ve written it s a total disaster It s been bad for Libya and it s bad also for the U S and its allies and for the rest of the world What we have is a worsening of a humanitarian situation, the death toll has increased by about 10 times We turned a state that was an ally in the war against terrorism into now a safe haven to terrorists, where both Al Qaeda and ISIS roam There s been proliferation of weapons, including surface to air missiles that can shoot down civilian airliners There s spillover of war to Mali no, it s been a total disaster SS:Also, NATO s recent interventions in general they re justified as humanitarian  How can a military intervention be humanitarian ? Bombing is not something humanitarian AK:I actually think that intervention can be humanitarian and I think that most of the interventions that NATO SS:But we re talking about military interventions AK:Absolutely Military intervention if there, for example, in Rwanda, there was a genocide, in Cambodia there was a genocide; if there had been military interventions, those interventions could have stopped the killers and saved lots of lives There have been such interventions, for example in East Pakistan in 1971, there was an intervention that stopped the genocide; there was intervention in Uganda, when Idi Amin was killing people So, military intervention can save lives, and, in fact, NATO interventions, for example, in Bosnia and Kosovo, in Libya, were motivated by a humanitarian impulse the problem is, that sometimes they backfire and they wind up actually increasing the humanitarian suffering, increasing the death toll, and that s what happened in Libya SS:Like you pointed out, if things were bad under Gaddafi, they are even worse now I mean, Libya is a failed state today with warring factions tearing it further apart Why doesn t anyone want to interfere now? AK:I think it s because it is a very dangerous place and the West, NATO and the Arab League and the Gulf GCC those folks were willing to have a easy intervention, which was what they thought was going to happen in 2011, that it would just be quick and they would topple Gaddafi and then we would get a new democratic state that would be pro Western; so that they were willing to do using just airpower, and there were few ground troops from Qatar, but no NATO ground troops Today what we have is a renewed civil war in Libya We have radical Islamic terrorists from Al Qaeda and ISIS and so, it would be very dangerous place to put NATO peacekeepers There have interventions, there have been interventions by Egypt and by UAE and by Turkey, but these interventions are actually on opposing sides of Libya s civil war What there s no stomach for, is the deployment of a large ground force of peacekeepers And so, Libya is, as you characterized it correctly, it is a failed state that is in the midst of civil war and provides state haven for Islamic terrorists SS:Now, Gaddafi by the early 2000s, he began working with the West, he started disarming, getting rid of the WMD and curbing his nuke program and a few years later, he is overthrown and killed That s not a very encouraging award for being cooperative, is it? AK:No, it was very ill conceived It was one of the reasons that NATO should not have intervened in Libya Gaddafi has been a very bad actor for many decades He had sponsored international terrorism, he had sponsored rebels around the world, started civil wars in Africa and elsewhere But he changed He changed in around 2000, and then again, in 2003, when the U S led an intervention in Iraq, and Gaddafi said: I don t want to be the next target  and he gave up his nuclear weapons program, he started cooperating even before that in the war against Al Qaeda, because he was a target of Al Qaeda So, in a sense NATO and Libya had a common enemy in Al Qaeda, and they allied and shared intelligence to try and conduct the global war on terror So, he was an ally of the West and despite that, in 2011, the U S and NATO decided to intervene to overthrow him and facilitate his being killed What that does is undermine international nuclear non proliferation policy, because what it says to anyone who has a WMD program is: If you have your program, then you can deter intervention against you But if you give up your program, then at some moment in the future, the international community may decide that you need to go, and you have no defense against it  So, this intervention in Libya will probably promote the spread of nuclear weapons and other WMDs, so it s very ill conceived and very unfortunate SS:Now, the EU is planning for an operation in Libya, provoked by an uncontrollable stream of migrants there Will the people trafficking be suppressed by military force, you think? Is this going to work? AK:It s a very dice and controversial situation It seems to be rather cold hearted and I think that if you have migrants on this ship and then you have European military forces taking action against those ships, there s going to be big outcry in Europe that this violates the spirit of refugees conventions, and that this folks may in fact have a well founded fear of persecution in their home country, and so they deserve to have an interview to decide if they should get asylum They re not going to get that interview if what you re doing is destroying these ships that they want to get on to get asylum So, it may not formally violate any international law, but it violates the spirit of allowing folks to seek asylum, and I think that especially in the Left, Europe is going to be up in arms about this; so, I understand why they are thinking of pursuing it, but I d be very surprised if that actually happens SS:Like you ve pointed out the chaos Libya was plunged into after NATO intervention turned it into a safe haven for Islamic State or other terrorist groups So, is waging a war against IS in Iraq and Syria of no use until Libya is addressed as well? AK:No, I don t think it should be the top priority in the War on Terror If you study military strategy, the probably most famous strategist is German from XIX century, Carl von Clausewitz, and he always talked about going to the center of gravity of the enemy, and the center of gravity of ISIS is not in Libya, the center of gravity of ISIS is in Iraq and Syria, and that s where they are holding territory, that s where they are recruiting, that s where they are making money, that s where they hatching plots that could attack the West, and so that needs to be the focus, I think, of Western efforts That being said, you don t want to have new safe havens and so, the radicals in Libya also need to be contained SS:But I want to talk about, you know, taking action in the center of gravity I am talking about action against ISIS in Iraq The U S is saying the Iraqi army doesn t want to fight and Iraqis are saying they re not getting enough help from the U S Can the Iraqi army do without a foreign intervention at this point? Are ground troops necessary? AK:Ground troops, for sure, are necessary to contain and then defeat ISIS The question is who s ground troops? They could be Iraqi ground troops, but then the question is which Iraqi ground troops? Will they be simply Shiite Arabs, or will they include Sunni Arabs as well as Kurds? So, they could be Iraqi, or they could be Iranian, or Iranian proxies or they could be Western troops At the moment, we have a combination of all of those, and yet, they are not succeeding They are not succeeding because they are not fighting together, they are not united, this is something where, actually, I think, the Obama Administration is one of the few areas where I agree with them, that the key to victory is to get all of the Iraqi people across ethnic and sectarian lines united If they were united, then I think they could defeat ISIS rather quickly SS:Professor, you ve said in one of your interviews on the anti ISIS effort: When Iraqis get their act together, think of themselves as Iraqis, not Sunnis or Shias then we will come in  But ISIS is close to Baghdad now Is there really time to wait? AK:It s a very interesting game of chicken between the Obama Administration and the Iraqi government in Baghdad Essentially, what Obama said and I think he was correct to say this is: we want you, Iraqis, to unite, before we will come in and help a lot in this war  The reason is, if the U S or NATO just came in and helped a lot, then the Shia dominated government of Baghdad could say: fine! We ll just continue to oppress and ignore the Sunni, and the U S and NATO will help us to do that  What would happen then, is that the Sunni in Iraq would say: Our only potential friends are ISIS  and they would join ISIS; and so, it wouldn t defeat ISIS, it would actually bolster ISIS And so, what Obama said to Baghdad is: You, Shia in Baghdad, you need to share power with Sunnis you need to provide them with weapons, you need to incorporate them into your security forces and when you folks are united, then you will be able to start to make progress against ISIS, and we will actually help you do that  However, there are hardline Shias in the government in Baghdad, and they are refusing so far to really share power or share weapons with the Sunni And so, the U S is therefore withholding the full force of its intervention, and that s part of the reason that you saw ISIS make progress, and essentially, what Obama is saying to Baghdad: ISIS will continue to make progress until you share power with Sunnis , and Baghdad is trying to basically blackmail Washington, saying: Oh, ISIS is about to defeat us, you d better come in and do more airstrikes!  SS:But everything that we re talking about right now: the ISIS, the Shias, the Sunnis, them being so fractured I mean, the U S intervention in Iraq was what caused this mess in Iraq in the first place So, is it fair to say that the U S troops need to be there to do the cleaning up right now? Because, don t you think the U S sort of bears the responsibility? AK:One can think of two reasons why the U S and its allies should be there: one would be this ethical argument that we broke it and so we need to stick around to fix it; and the second, which I think is more realistic in terms of driving policy, is that the U S has an interest in Iraq not being a failed state, Iraq not being a breeding ground for terrorists and ISIS not having a third or half of a country where it can produce revenue, train radical terrorists and send them around the world to strike against the U S and Western interests So, whether it s ethics or whether it s self interest, U S absolutely has an interest in defeating ISIS The question is how? If the U S would go in too heavily right now, it would allow the Shia led government in Baghdad to continue ignoring and oppressing and excluding Sunni, and that would actually bolster ISIS SS:Let me tell you an interesting fact: last week I spoke to Iraq s interior minister, and he told me that no one wants to see American troops in Iraq I mean, he wants more help from America, but they don t want to see American troops in Iraq Why is that in your opinion? AK:Well, there s a number of reasons The Shiite militias that dominate Iraqi security forces were killing American troops the last time they were there that was their raison d'etre, so if Americans come over there, they could be in crosshairs SS:I don t think he was worried too much about the security of the American forces when he was saying that he doesn t want to see American troops on the ground AK:No, I understand that, but I m explaining that it wouldn t be a new thing for these Iraqi forces to oppose Americans being there They opposed them the entire time they were there There were some folks who liked the Americans being there those are, for example, Sunni moderates But those Sunni moderates are being excluded right now from power and from weapons by the Iraqi government So, I was just trying to say that this is not new The folks who don t want Americans to be there are the folks who always opposed Americans being there They are the radical Shiites, associated with the government, and there are radical Sunni that are now calling themselves ISIS  or the Islamic State SS:We ve also heard Ashton Carter being worried about Iran being involved in this operation against ISIS in Iraq So, Iran is actually at the forefront of international aid to Iraq against ISIS and again, we see apprehension from the West about this role Is this a pattern? Is intervening only okay when the West does it? I mean, Iranians are obviously helping to push out ISIS more than anyone else right now AK:I think there is a view in Washington and in NATO that, as you put it, the intervention is only right when the U S or NATO does it You ve seen the reaction to the deployment of Russian aid and Russian forces in Ukraine, and the same thing in Georgia and those two interventions are in some ways analogous to Western interventions in Kosovo and in Bosnia and in Libya So, yes, I think it s quite common that each country thinks its interventions are justified and enemy or rival countries, when they intervene, they are not justified SS:Even though you re fighting the same cause? AK:In this case, it s very interesting, because the U S and Iran have a common enemy in ISIS, but U S believes that if we defeat ISIS then we ll go home, but if Iran defeats ISIS, then Iran will essentially control Iraq as a not a vassal, not a tributary state, but as an extension of its regional power with an ultimate goal of having some sort of regional hegemony SS:Why not work with Iran on the strategy to defeat ISIS together? AK:Again, it s because, I think, we have a common interest in defeating ISIS, but beyond that, we do not have common interests SS:President Obama has said in an interview that a more aggressive effort to rebuild Libyan society was needed for success Why does America see itself as world s carpenter on contract? I mean, going around rebuilding societies? Why the desire to nation build elsewhere, not at home, when, you know, I hear some major American politicians admit that their own system is broken and needs to be fixed? AK:I think that really goes to the root of what America is America has ideals that it feels are not simply for Americans, but that are universal These are ideals of freedom, of liberty, of the right of expression, of the right to life and to seek happiness SS:Don t you feel like America is in different than when these ideals were, like, worn, at its peak in 70s or in 80s? Because a country that has Baltimore and has the biggest growing gap between poor and rich really, can they really go elsewhere and rebuild other societies when they really need to fix their own in the first place? AK:First of all, I would say that America is still considered by the rest of the world the best place  We have more people trying to come to America than are trying to go anywhere else on Earth, and so, I think that s partially because of the economic success of America and partially because of these ideals that I talked about, that anybody can accomplish anything in America Now, of course, this goes up and down over time, and we certainly have bad economic inequality at the moment, but that doesn t change what America is, and what it is in people s minds Secondly, in terms of resources of America, we still have incredible resources to try and help the rest of the world Our economy is not shrinking, it is growing It is bigger that it has ever been before and we spend billions of dollars around the world, for example, doing foreign aid, democracy promotion now, it doesn t always work Sometimes, backfires, but it is largely well intentioned So, when you ask Why does the U S want to be the world s carpenter or contractor  I think it is in our DNA, and it is especially in our DNA when there s a place that we ve helped to break We do have this, what was known as, I think the China barn  or pottery barn  policy by Colin Powell, the Secretary of State under our last president, which is If you break it, you bought it  So, when we break a place, like we broke Iraq, or like we broke Afghanistan, or like we broke Libya I think that we do feel there s a moral responsibility to try to fix it if we can But then again, after a while, if we fail, then people get frustrated and tired, and that s what the Obama Administration sort of represented: we were tired of trying to do what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and so, there was a pullout We were tired of these big interventions and so we did a small intervention in Libya, and the result is now that we have chaos in Iraq, chaos in Libya and you know what? We re going to have chaos in Afghanistan, it s already growing The casualties there are much bigger this year than they have been in the last few years, and Afghanistan is going to be the next basket case as U S and ally troops pull out The fact of the matter is, these places are broken and I don t think that America is going to stand aside and let them be broken; at some point we re going to do something again, because yes, we do see ourselves as world s carpenter on contract we do feel we have a moral responsibility to the whole world SS:Thank you, professor, that s all the time we have for today, but thanks for this wonderful interview We were talking to professor Alan Kuperman, discussing humanitarian interventions and who needs to bear the responsibility for their consequences That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/265660-west-humanitarian-intervention-invasion/

"26 Feb, 2015",âWhy the rise of fascism is again the issue,"The recent 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz was a reminder of the great crime of fascism, whose Nazi iconography is embedded in our consciousness Fascism is preserved as
 history, as flickering footage of goose stepping blackshirts,
 their criminality terrible and clear Yet in the same liberal
 societies, whose war making elites urge us never to forget, the
 accelerating danger of a modern kind of fascism is suppressed;
 for it is their fascism To initiate a war of aggression , said the
 Nuremberg Tribunal judges in 1946, is not only an
 international crime, it is the supreme international crime,
 differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within
 itself the accumulated evil of the whole  Had the Nazis not invaded Europe, Auschwitz and the Holocaust
 would not have happened Had the United States and its satellites
 not initiated their war of aggression in Iraq in 2003, almost a
 million people would be alive today; and Islamic State, or ISIS,
 would not have us in thrall to its savagery They are the progeny
 of modern fascism, weaned by the bombs, bloodbaths and lies that
 are the surreal theatre known as news Like the fascism of the 1930s and 1940s, big lies are delivered
 with the precision of a metronome: thanks to an omnipresent,
 repetitive media and its virulent censorship by omission Take
 the catastrophe in Libya In 2011, NATO launched 9,700 strike sorties against Libya, of
 which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets Uranium
 warheads were used; the cities of Misurata and Sirte were
 carpet bombed The Red Cross identified mass graves, and UNICEF
 reported that most [of the children killed] were under the age
 of ten The public sodomising of the Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi
 with a rebel bayonet was greeted by the then US Secretary of
 State, Hillary Clinton, with the words: We came, we saw, he
 died His murder, like the destruction of his country, was
 justified with a familiar big lie; he was planning genocide 
 against his own people We knew that if we waited one more
 day, said President Obama, Benghazi, a city the size of
 Charlotte, could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated
 across the region and stained the conscience of the world This was the fabrication of Islamist militias facing defeat by
 Libyan government forces They told Reuters there would be a
 real bloodbath, a massacre like we saw in Rwanda Reported on
 March 14, 2011, the lie provided the first spark for NATO s
 inferno, described by David Cameron as a humanitarian
 intervention Secretly supplied and trained by Britain s SAS, many of the
 rebels would become ISIS, whose latest video offering shows the
 beheading of 21 Coptic Christian workers seized in Sirte, the
 city destroyed on their behalf by NATO bombers For Obama, Cameron and Hollande, Gaddafi s true crime was Libya s
 economic independence and his declared intention to stop selling
 Africa s greatest oil reserves in US dollars The petrodollar is
 a pillar of American imperial power Gaddafi audaciously planned
 to underwrite a common African currency backed by gold, establish
 an all Africa bank and promote economic union among poor
 countries with prized resources Whether or not this would
 happen, the very notion was intolerable to the US as it prepared
 to enter Africa and bribe African governments with military
 partnerships Following NATO s attack under cover of a Security Council
 resolution, Obama, wrote Garikai Chengu, confiscated $30 billion
 from Libya s Central Bank, which Gaddafi had earmarked for the
 establishment of an African Central Bank and the African gold
 backed dinar currency The humanitarian war against Libya drew on a model close to
 western liberal hearts, especially in the media In 1999, Bill
 Clinton and Tony Blair sent NATO to bomb Serbia, because, they
 lied, the Serbs were committing genocide against ethnic
 Albanians in the secessionist province of Kosovo David Scheffer,
 US ambassador at large for war crimes [sic], claimed that as many
 as 225,000 ethnic Albanian men aged between 14 and 59 might
 have been murdered Both Clinton and Blair evoked the Holocaust
 and the spirit of the Second World War The West s heroic
 allies were the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), whose criminal
 record was set aside The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook,
 told them to call him any time on his mobile phone With the NATO bombing over, and much of Serbia s infrastructure
 in ruins, along with schools, hospitals, monasteries and the
 national TV station, international forensic teams descended upon
 Kosovo to exhume evidence of the holocaust The FBI failed to
 find a single mass grave and went home The Spanish forensic team
 did the same, its leader angrily denouncing a semantic pirouette
 by the war propaganda machines A year later, a United Nations
 tribunal on Yugoslavia announced the final count of the dead in
 Kosovo: 2,788 This included combatants on both sides and Serbs
 and Roma murdered by the KLA There was no genocide The
 holocaust was a lie The NATO attack had been fraudulent Behind the lie, there was serious purpose Yugoslavia was a
 uniquely independent, multi ethnic federation that had stood as a
 political and economic bridge in the Cold War Most of its
 utilities and major manufacturing was publicly owned This was
 not acceptable to the expanding European Community, especially
 newly united Germany, which had begun a drive east to capture its
 natural market in the Yugoslav provinces of Croatia and
 Slovenia By the time the Europeans met at Maastricht in 1991 to
 lay their plans for the disastrous Eurozone, a secret deal had
 been struck; Germany would recognise Croatia Yugoslavia was
 doomed In Washington, the US saw that the struggling Yugoslav economy
 was denied World Bank loans NATO, then an almost defunct Cold
 War relic, was reinvented as imperial enforcer At a 1999 Kosovo
 peace conference in Rambouillet, in France, the Serbs were
 subjected to the enforcer s duplicitous tactics The Rambouillet
 accord included a secret Annex B, which the US delegation
 inserted on the last day This demanded the military occupation
 of the whole of Yugoslavia a country with bitter memories of
 the Nazi occupation and the implementation of a free market
 economy and the privatisation of all government assets No
 sovereign state could sign this Punishment followed swiftly;
 NATO bombs fell on a defenceless country It was the precursor to
 the catastrophes in Afghanistan and Iraq, Syria and Libya, and
 Ukraine Since 1945, more than a third of the membership of the United
 Nations 69 countries have suffered some or all of the
 following at the hands of America s modern fascism They have
 been invaded, their governments overthrown, their popular
 movements suppressed, their elections subverted, their people
 bombed and their economies stripped of all protection, their
 societies subjected to a crippling siege known as sanctions 
 The British historian Mark Curtis estimates the death toll in the
 millions In every case, a big lie was deployed Tonight, for the first
 time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over 
 These were opening words of Obama s 2015 State of the Union
 address In fact, some 10,000 troops and 20,000 military
 contractors (mercenaries) remain in Afghanistan on indefinite
 assignment The longest war in American history is coming to a
 responsible conclusion,  said Obama In fact, more civilians were
 killed in Afghanistan in 2014 than in any year since the UN took
 records The majority have been killed civilians and soldiers 
 during Obama s time as president The tragedy of Afghanistan rivals the epic crime in Indochina In
 his lauded and much quoted book, The Grand Chessboard: American
 Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, Zbigniew Brzezinski,
 the godfather of US policies from Afghanistan to the present day,
 writes that if America is to control Eurasia and dominate the
 world, it cannot sustain a popular democracy, because the
 pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion 
 Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilisation He is right 
 As WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden have revealed, a surveillance and
 police state is usurping democracy In 1976, Brzezinski, then
 President Carter s National Security Advisor, demonstrated his
 point by dealing a death blow to Afghanistan s first and only
 democracy Who knows this vital history? In the 1960s, a popular revolution swept Afghanistan, the poorest
 country on earth, eventually overthrowing the vestiges of the
 aristocratic regime in 1978 The People s Democratic Party of
 Afghanistan (PDPA) formed a government and declared a reform
 programme that included the abolition of feudalism, freedom for
 all religions, equal rights for women and social justice for the
 ethnic minorities More than 13,000 political prisoners were
 freed and police files publicly burned The new government introduced free medical care for the poorest;
 peonage was abolished, a mass literacy programme was launched 
 For women, the gains were unheard of By the late 1980s, half the
 university students were women, and women made up almost half of
 Afghanistan s doctors, a third of civil servants and the majority
 of teachers Every girl, recalled Saira Noorani, a female
 surgeon, could go to high school and university We could go
 where we wanted and wear what we liked We used to go to cafes
 and the cinema to see the latest Indian film on a Friday and
 listen to the latest music It all started to go wrong when the
 Mujahideen started winning They used to kill teachers and burn
 schools We were terrified It was funny and sad to think these
 were the people the West supported The PDPA government was backed by the Soviet Union, even though,
 as former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance later admitted, there
 was no evidence of any Soviet complicity [in the revolution] 
 Alarmed by the growing confidence of liberation movements
 throughout the world, Brzezinski decided that if Afghanistan was
 to succeed under the PDPA, its independence and progress would
 offer the threat of a promising example On July 3, 1979, the White House secretly authorized support for
 tribal fundamentalist groups known as the Mujahideen, a program
 that grew to over $500 million a year in U S arms and other
 assistance The aim was the overthrow of Afghanistan s first
 secular, reformist government In August 1979, the US embassy in
 Kabul reported that the United States larger interests 
 would be served by the demise of [the PDPA government],despite whatever setbacks this might mean for future social
 and economic reforms in Afghanistan The italics are mine The Mujahideen were the forebears of al Qaeda and Islamic State 
 They included Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who received tens of millions
 of dollars in cash from the CIA Hekmatyar s specialty was
 trafficking in opium and throwing acid in the faces of women who
 refused to wear the veil Invited to London, he was lauded by
 Prime Minister Thatcher as a freedom fighter Such fanatics might have remained in their tribal world had
 Brzezinski not launched an international movement to promote
 Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia and so undermine secular
 political liberation and destabilise the Soviet Union,
 creating, as he wrote in his autobiography, a few stirred up
 Muslims His grand plan coincided with the ambitions of the
 Pakistani dictator, General Zia ul Haq, to dominate the region 
 In 1986, the CIA and Pakistan s intelligence agency, the ISI,
 began to recruit people from around the world to join the Afghan
 jihad The Saudi multi millionaire Osama bin Laden was one of
 them Operatives who would eventually join the Taliban and
 al Qaeda, were recruited at an Islamic college in Brooklyn, New
 York, and given paramilitary training at a CIA camp in Virginia 
 This was called Operation Cyclone Its success was celebrated
 in 1996 when the last PDPA president of Afghanistan, Mohammed
 Najibullah who had gone before the UN General Assembly to plead
 for help was hanged from a streetlight by the Taliban The blowback of Operation Cyclone and its few stirred up
 Muslims was September 11, 2001 Operation Cyclone became the
 war on terror , in which countless men, women and children would
 lose their lives across the Muslim world, from Afghanistan to
 Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and Syria The enforcer s message was and
 remains: You are with us or against us The common thread in fascism, past and present, is mass murder 
 The American invasion of Vietnam had its free fire zones , body
 counts and collatoral damage In the province of Quang Ngai,
 where I reported from, many thousands of civilians ( gooks ) were
 murdered by the US; yet only one massacre, at My Lai, is
 remembered In Laos and Cambodia, the greatest aerial bombardment
 in history produced an epoch of terror marked today by the
 spectacle of joined up bomb craters which, from the air, resemble
 monstrous necklaces The bombing gave Cambodia its own ISIS, led
 by Pol Pot READ MORE: From Pol Pot to ISIS: Anything that
 flies on everything that moves  Today, the world s greatest single campaign of terror entails the
 execution of entire families, guests at weddings, mourners at
 funerals These are Obama s victims According to the New York
 Times, Obama makes his selection from a CIA kill list presented
 to him every Tuesday in the White House Situation Room He then
 decides, without a shred of legal justification, who will live
 and who will die His execution weapon is the Hellfire missile
 carried by a pilotless aircraft known as a drone; these roast
 their victims and festoon the area with their remains Each hit 
 is registered on a faraway console screen as a bugsplat For goose steppers, wrote the historian Norman Pollock,
 substitute the seemingly more innocuous militarisation of the
 total culture And for the bombastic leader, we have the reformer
 manque, blithely at work, planning and executing assassination,
 smiling all the while Uniting fascism old and new is the cult of superiority I
 believe in American exceptionalism with every fibre of my being, 
 said Obama, evoking declarations of national fetishism from the
 1930s As the historian Alfred W McCoy has pointed out, it was
 the Hitler devotee, Carl Schmitt, who said, The sovereign is he
 who decides the exception This sums up Americanism, the world s
 dominant ideology That it remains unrecognised as a predatory
 ideology is the achievement of an equally unrecognised
 brainwashing Insidious, undeclared, presented wittily as
 enlightenment on the march, its conceit insinuates western
 culture I grew up on a cinematic diet of American glory, almost
 all of it a distortion I had no idea that it was the Red Army
 that had destroyed most of the Nazi war machine, at a cost of as
 many as 13 million soldiers By contrast, US losses, including in
 the Pacific, were 400,000 Hollywood reversed this The difference now is that cinema audiences are invited to wring
 their hands at the tragedy of American psychopaths having to
 kill people in distant places just as the President himself
 kills them The embodiment of Hollywood s violence, the actor and
 director Clint Eastwood, was nominated for an Oscar this year for
 his movie, American Sniper, which is about a licensed murderer
 and nutcase The New York Times described it as a patriotic,
 pro family picture which broke all attendance records in its
 opening days There are no heroic movies about America s embrace of fascism 
 During the Second World War, America (and Britain) went to war
 against Greeks who had fought heroically against Nazism and were
 resisting the rise of Greek fascism In 1967, the CIA helped
 bring to power a fascist military junta in Athens as it did in
 Brazil and most of Latin America Germans and east Europeans who
 had colluded with Nazi aggression and crimes against humanity
 were given safe haven in the US; many were pampered and their
 talents rewarded Wernher von Braun was the father of both the
 Nazi V 2 terror bomb and the US space programme In the 1990s, as former Soviet republics, Eastern Europe and the
 Balkans became military outposts of NATO, the heirs to a Nazi
 movement in Ukraine were given their opportunity Responsible for
 the deaths of thousands of Jews, Poles and Russians during the
 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian fascism was
 rehabilitated and its new wave hailed by the enforcer as
 nationalists This reached its apogee in 2014 when the Obama administration
 splashed out $5 billion on a coup against the elected government 
 The shock troops were neo Nazis known as the Right Sector and
 Svoboda Their leaders include Oleh Tyahnybok, who has called for
 a purge of the Moscow Jewish mafia and other scum , including
 gays, feminists and those on the political left These fascists are now integrated into the Kiev coup government 
 The first deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Andriy
 Parubiy, a leader of the governing party, is co founder of
 Svoboda On February 14, Parubiy announced he was flying to
 Washington get the USA to give us highly precise modern
 weaponry If he succeeds, it will be seen as an act of war by
 Russia No western leader has spoken up about the revival of fascism in
 the heart of Europe with the exception of Vladimir Putin, whose
 people lost 22 million to a Nazi invasion that came through the
 borderland of Ukraine At the recent Munich Security Conference,
 Obama s Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian
 Affairs, Victoria Nuland, ranted abuse about European leaders for
 opposing the US arming of the Kiev regime She referred to the
 German Defence Minister as the minister for defeatism It was
 Nuland who masterminded the coup in Kiev The wife of Robert D 
 Kagan, a leading neo con luminary and co founder of the extreme
 right wing Project for a New American Century, she was foreign
 policy advisor to Dick Cheney Nuland s coup did not go to plan NATO was prevented from seizing
 Russia s historic, legitimate, warm water naval base in Crimea 
 The mostly Russian population of Crimea illegally annexed to
 Ukraine by Nikita Krushchev in 1954 voted overwhelmingly to
 return to Russia, as they had done in the 1990s The referendum
 was voluntary, popular and internationally observed There was no
 invasion At the same time, the Kiev regime turned on the ethnic Russian
 population in the east with the ferocity of ethnic cleaning 
 Deploying neo Nazi militias in the manner of the Waffen SS, they
 bombed and laid to siege cities and towns They used mass
 starvation as a weapon, cutting off electricity, freezing bank
 accounts, stopping social security and pensions More than a
 million refugees fled across the border into Russia In the
 western media, they became unpeople escaping the violence 
 caused by the Russian invasion The NATO commander, General
 Breedlove whose name and actions might have been inspired by
 Stanley Kubrick s Dr Strangelove announced that 40,000 Russian
 troops were massing In the age of forensic satellite evidence,
 he offered none These Russian speaking and bilingual people of Ukraine a third
 of the population have long sought a federation that reflects
 the country s ethnic diversity and is both autonomous and
 independent of Moscow Most are not separatists but citizens
 who want to live securely in their homeland and oppose the power
 grab in Kiev Their revolt and establishment of autonomous
 states are a reaction to Kiev s attacks on them Little of this
 has been explained to western audiences On May 2, 2014, in Odessa, 41 ethnic Russians were burned alive
 in the trade union headquarters with police standing by The
 Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh hailed the massacre as another
 bright day in our national history In the American and British
 media, this was reported as a murky tragedy resulting from
 clashes between nationalists (neo Nazis) and separatists 
 (people collecting signatures for a referendum on a federal
 Ukraine) The New York Times buried the story, having dismissed as Russian
 propaganda warnings about the fascist and anti Semitic policies
 of Washington s new clients The Wall Street Journal damned the
 victims Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels,
 Government Says Obama congratulated the junta for its
 restraint If Putin can be provoked into coming to their aid, his
 pre ordained pariah role in the West will justify the lie that
 Russia is invading Ukraine On January 29, Ukraine s top military
 commander, General Viktor Muzhemko, almost inadvertently
 dismissed the very basis for US and EU sanctions on Russia when
 he told a news conference emphatically: The Ukrainian army is
 not fighting with the regular units of the Russian Army There
 were individual citizens who were members of illegal armed
 groups , but there was no Russian invasion This was not news 
 Vadym Prystaiko, Kiev s Deputy Foreign Minister, has called for
 full scale war with nuclear armed Russia On February 21, US Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from
 Oklahoma, introduced a bill that would authorise American arms
 for the Kiev regime In his Senate presentation, Inhofe used
 photographs he claimed were of Russian troops crossing into
 Ukraine, which have long been exposed as fakes It was
 reminiscent of Ronald Reagan s fake pictures of a Soviet
 installation in Nicaragua, and Colin Powell s fake evidence to
 the UN of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq The intensity of the smear campaign against Russia and the
 portrayal of its president as a pantomime villain is unlike
 anything I have known as a reporter Robert Parry, one of
 America s most distinguished investigative journalists, who
 revealed the Iran Contra scandal, wrote recently, No European
 government, since Adolf Hitler s Germany, has seen fit to
 dispatch Nazi storm troopers to wage war on a domestic
 population, but the Kiev regime has and has done so knowingly 
 Yet across the West s media/political spectrum, there has been a
 studious effort to cover up this reality even to the point of
 ignoring facts that have been well established If you wonder
 how the world could stumble into world war three much as it did
 into world war one a century ago all you need to do is look at
 the madness over Ukraine that has proved impervious to facts or
 reason In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German
 media: The use made by Nazi conspirators of psychological
 warfare is well known Before each major aggression, with some
 few exceptions based on expediency, they initiated a press
 campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the
 German people psychologically for the attack In the
 propaganda system of the Hitler State it was the daily press and
 the radio that were the most important weapons In the Guardian on February 2, Timothy Garton Ash called, in
 effect, for a world war Putin must be stopped, said the
 headline And sometimes only guns can stop guns He conceded
 that the threat of war might nourish a Russian paranoia of
 encirclement ; but that was fine He name checked the military
 equipment needed for the job and advised his readers that
 America has the best kit In 2003, Garton Ash, an Oxford professor, repeated the propaganda
 that led to the slaughter in Iraq Saddam Hussein, he wrote,
 has, as [Colin] Powell documented, stockpiled large quantities
 of horrifying chemical and biological weapons, and is hiding what
 remains of them He is still trying to get nuclear ones He
 lauded Blair as a Gladstonian, Christian liberal
 interventionist In 2006, he wrote, Now we face the next big
 test of the West after Iraq: Iran The outbursts or as Garton Ash prefers, his tortured liberal
 ambivalence are not untypical of those in the transatlantic
 liberal elite who have struck a Faustian deal The war criminal
 Blair is their lost leader The Guardian, in which Garton Ash s
 piece appeared, published a full page advertisement for an
 American Stealth bomber On a menacing image of the Lockheed
 Martin monster were the words: The F 35 GREAT For Britain 
 This American kit will cost British taxpayers £1 3 billion, its
 F model predecessors having slaughtered across the world In tune
 with its advertiser, a Guardian editorial has demanded an
 increase in military spending Once again, there is serious purpose The rulers of the world
 want Ukraine not only as a missile base; they want its economy 
 Kiev s new Finance Minister, Nataliwe Jaresko, is a former senior
 US State Department official in charge of US overseas
 investment She was hurriedly given Ukrainian citizenship They want Ukraine for its abundant gas; Vice President Joe
 Biden s son is on the board of Ukraine s biggest oil, gas and
 fracking company The manufacturers of GM seeds, companies such
 as the infamous Monsanto, want Ukraine s rich farming soil Above all, they want Ukraine s mighty neighbour, Russia They
 want to Balkanise or dismember Russia and exploit the greatest
 source of natural gas on earth As the Arctic ice melts, they
 want control of the Arctic Ocean and its energy riches, and
 Russia s long Arctic land border Their man in Moscow used to be
 Boris Yeltsin, a drunk, who handed his country s economy to the
 West His successor, Putin, has re established Russia as a
 sovereign nation; that is his crime The responsibility of the rest of us is clear It is to identify
 and expose the reckless lies of warmongers and never to collude
 with them It is to re awaken the great popular movements that
 brought a fragile civilisation to modern imperial states Most
 important, it is to prevent the conquest of ourselves: our minds,
 our humanity, our self respect If we remain silent, victory over
 us is assured, and a holocaust beckons John Pilger,

"28 Nov, 2014",âSave the corporationsâ¦I mean children,"When Save the Children chose to bestow the Global Legacy Award on Tony Blair, the charity inadvertently revealed the dark underbelly of NGO activity Dr Roslyn Fuller is a lecturer in International Law based in Ireland She is the author of Ireland s leading textbook on International Law Biehler on International Law: An Irish Perspective (Round Hall, 2013) In addition to her academic work, she has also writes for the Irish Times, The Irish Independent and The Journal on topics of law, politics and education Roslyn has been researching democracy for over a decade and is the author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning and Lost Its Way  (October 2015, Zed Books) She tweets at @roslynfuller and can be reached at fullerr@tcd ie Dr Roslyn Fuller is a lecturer in International Law based in Ireland She is the author of Ireland s leading textbook on International Law Biehler on International Law: An Irish Perspective (Round Hall, 2013) In addition to her academic work, she has also writes for the Irish Times, The Irish Independent and The Journal on topics of law, politics and education Roslyn has been researching democracy for over a decade and is the author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning and Lost Its Way  (October 2015, Zed Books) She tweets at @roslynfuller and can be reached at fullerr@tcd ie When Tony Blair received
 the Global Legacy Award last week from Save the Children, an
 organization dedicated to transforming children s
 lives, it seemed like a bad joke to many people This,
 after all, was a man who had been willing to use fabricated
 evidence to launch an illegal war against Iraq during his time as
 Britain s Prime Minister, a conflict that irrevocably transformed the lives of thousands of children by
 killing them These days Blair is advising the new military
 regime in Egypt and doing a sideline in Saudi oil kickbacks We
 don t hear too much about children in either of those countries,
 but I m willing to bet that living under military or aristocratic
 dictatorship isn t too good for the little mites, especially
 when, as is the case with Saudi Arabia, child marriage is nothing
 unusual Considering this track record, I would think that anyone who has
 simply refrained from hurting children would be more qualified to
 receive an award from a charity dedicated to their protection
 than Tony Blair So how did Teflon Tony not only get away with murder,
 but actually get rewarded for it? Did the good folks at Save the
 Children simply suffer a regrettable overdose of saintliness,
 deciding to sweep Blair s past transgressions under the rug, and
 judge him not lest they themselves be judged? It sounds like the
 kind of misguided, goodness orgy that an organization dedicated
 to helping children might be susceptible to But if your idea of
 charity is still stuck in the age of rending thy cloak in half to
 clothe the naked, and dividing thy bread to feed the hungry,
 think again These days helping the needy is big business Much has
 (rightly) been made of Save the Children s direct connections to
 Blair: UK Chief Executive Justin Forsyth worked for Tony Blair
 back when he was Prime Minister, as did Fergus Drake, the
 charity s UK Director of Programmes But these two hardly make up
 the entire decision making apparatus of the global behemoth that
 is Save the Children How did such a disastrous decision slide
 through the ranks? A quick scan of the current and former
 occupations of Save the Children s trustees and top staff shows
 why the idea of rewarding the former PM slipped down their gullet
 so effortlessly: Barclays Bank, Unilever, Proctor & Gamble,
 Xerox, Yahoo, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, American Express,
 Goldman Sachs, KPMG, Coca Cola, IKEA the list goes on With a line up like this behind Save the Children, it s
 positively shocking that it took the organization so long to hand
 old Tony his lifetime achievement award It would be hard to
 think of someone who has done more for the corporations that many
 of the trustees and management staff seem to have such a close
 relationship with Not least of these favors would be letting
 them avoid paying millions in taxes by failing to close loopholes
 (e g Proctor & Gamble andIKEAandBarclays) And, while Save the Children is in the news today, its
 establishment friendly structure is by no means unusual Many
 large NGOs are little more than public sector mirrors of private
 sector interests, with a top staff that has every reason not to
 rock the status quo Governments like to involve the public by consulting
 with NGOs so that they can pretend to meet people halfway and
 hear their concerns  Ensuring that no one in a position of
 power at those NGOs has any truly radical ideas is a good way to
 control this conversation while maintaining a paper thin veneer
 of political inclusiveness At the same time big corporations,
 who are allowed to avoid taxes can donate a small fraction of
 those funds to the right kind of NGO By voluntarily giving back to the communities they ve sucked so much out of, as
 opposed to the involuntary way in which everyone else gives back on their annual tax return, big
 corporations can adorn themselves with the laurels of their community outreach and proud sponsorship Of course it is only natural for a company that gives such a
 large donation to be rewarded with a seat on the NGO s board 
 Just as it is only natural for governments to reach
 out to the kind of NGO that has a silver plated list of
 trustees and upper management that they already do business with
 rather than one run by the kind of rabble that make uncomfortable
 demands It s a match made in paradise for everyone involved Save the Children s award to Tony Blair may have stepped over the
 line and provoked outrage, but this problem has been cruising
 quietly just under the surface for a long time, as big charities
 have moved so far into lockstep with government and corporate
 interests as to become virtually indistinguishable from them You
 can t challenge the establishment when you are part of it But NGOs are good for so much more than just siphoning off
 domestic disgruntlement into the Kafkaesque world of civil
 society discourse  NGO just means non governmental organization, i e all
 you really need to be is an organization that is not officially
 part of the government And you can slice that pretty fine Consider the Club of Madrid, composed of nearly 100 former democratic Presidents and Prime Ministers (e g Bill
 Clinton, Jimmy Carter) and funded by (among others) the cities of
 Rotterdam and Madrid, the World Bank, the IMF, the Governments of
 Belgium and Mexico and the International Development Agencies of
 Australia and Sweden The club also receives
 sponsorship fromWal Mart, Microsoft and NATO Or perhaps I can
 interest you in Kenya s Institute of Economic Affairs brought to
 you by the Canadian and Swedish International Development
 Agencies, as well as the European Union and the Center for
 Private Enterprise Past donors have included theWorld Bank, as well as the Dutch and Danish
 Embassies and the British Council Some NGO s receive more than 90 percent of their budget from a
 single government source, sometimes a foreign government This is
 particularly prevalent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia In Kyrgyzstan between 70 100 percent of the budget of a typical
 NGO is provided by foreign donors and the overwhelming
 majority of NGO officials recognized operating there that the accountability of an NGO to the donor is a top
 priority A study conducted in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine
 revealed that only one fifth of NGOs agreed that their strength
 came from their membership base The researchers concluded that the elitist nature of NGOs could be attributed to the
 fact that they received most of their funding from foreign
 sources, citing frequent NGO meetings with foreign embassies 
 These kinds of NGOs are sometimes called AstroTurf ,
 because they don t have any real support  they re merely a front
 organizations meant to pursue the agenda of whoever holds the
 checkbook, often without the full knowledge of those actually
 doing the work on the ground These aren t charities but weapons
 in the endless battle that is global politics, quite literally a
 fifth column operating behind enemy lines According to American
 politician Ron Paul, the US funneled $5 billion through NGOs
 active in Ukraine in the service of overthrowing Victor
 Yanukovich s government It is pause for thought, especially when
 one notes the ferocity with which donor nations resist the
 slightest regulation of NGO activity in foreign nations When Russia passed a law in 2012 requiring that NGOs register as
 foreign agents if they received foreign funding it was touted
 around the world as proof of Vladimir Putin s insanity How dare
 he try to get foreign NGOs to do something as demeaning as
 register, an action all real foreign people already
 have to undertake when they set up in most European countries,
 including Russia? My guess would be that one dares these things
 when foreign funded NGOs start meeting with embassies from donor
 nations That s the kind of activity that rings alarm bells There are, of course, real grassroots NGOs out there, somewhere
 beyond the circle of limelight that encloses the gala dinners and
 fancy trophies There are people who do good work, providing
 relief or a hand up for those most in need, but Blair s Global
 Legacy Award shows just how much all of their efforts have been
 hijacked by the fraud that global charity has become,
 an empty shell all too happy to glad hand those at the top while
 kicking those at the bottom Some of the statistics in this article taken from: Anara

 terrorist group formerly known as ISIS (or ISIL) has over the
 past weeks dominated much of the world s news coverage Their
 brutal occupation of territories formally part of Syria and Iraq
 (thereby realizing the effective Balkanization of the Middle
 East) followed by their equally brutal persecution of, first, a
 Yazidi community forced to flee up a mountain near Sinjar and,
 now, the Shi ite Turkmen town of Amerli (in fact, already under
 siege for the past 2 months), and particularly their recent
 internet broadcast execution of American journalist James Foley
 have carved the group into the global audience s consciousness
 and beyond Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who likes to call himself Caliph
 Ibrahim , as leader of the IS with apparently unlimited
 ambitions, has taken over the position vacated by bin Laden in
 the wee hours of 2 May 2011, when he was killed by twenty three
 Navy SEALs from Team Six in the Pakistani town carrying the
 unlikely name of Abbottabad Personalizing the enemy makes it
 easier to explain goals and objectives to the wider public US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel did not hesitate to do just that
 some days ago (21 August 2014) Hagel literally said that Caliph
 Ibrahim and the IS constitute an imminent threat to every
 interest we [the United States] have, whether it s in Iraq or
 anywhere else ,then adding Oh, this is beyond anything
 that we ve seen So we must prepare for everything  The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Martin
 Dempsey , also present at the briefing, went on to describe the
 IS as an organization that has an apocalyptic, end of days
 strategic vision and which will eventually have to be
 defeated Dempsey explained that this defeat has to be
 realized on both sides of what is essentially at this point
 a non existent border of Syria and Iraq, referring to
 territories that are now, for all intents and purposes, the lands
 actually ruled by Caliph Ibrahim and subject to the idiosyncratic
 interpretation of Islam and the Shariah that make up the ideology
 of the Islamic State And in this way, the West has now finally
 acquired its new bogeyman, able to attract and focus all kinds of
 intelligence and military attention In the face of this new threat, President Obama once again
 followed his predecessor s lead and started assembling his own coalition of the willing, starting a diplomatic
 campaign behind the scenes to enlist not just regional allies and
 neighbors, but a wider alliance comprising also Australia and
 Britain, in addition to such local players like Turkey, Jordan,
 Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Speaking at the veterans organization the American Legion in
 Charlotte, N C on Tuesday (26 August), the President assured his
 audience that [r]ooting out a cancer like ISIL [, still
 using the now familiar acronymization instead of the arguably
 somewhat more intimidating phrase Islamic State or simply IS]
 won t be easy, and it won t be quick, in spite of the US s
 awesome military might In a rhetorical turn reminiscent of Bush,
 Jr in the aftermath of 9/11, Obama vowed to take the fight
 to these barbaric terrorists, to faraway shores and fields
 at a more than safe distance from American soil, adding that the
 caliphal forces would be no match for a united
 international community under the banner of Obama s very own
 coalition of the willing  Previously, President Obama had authorized air strikes aimed at
 IS positions in aid of the KRG s Peshmerga forces defensive
 military operations In this context, it seems no coincidence
 that the name Kurdistan pops up in regular news casts nowadays in
 reference to northern Iraq s KRG a tacit acknowledgement of USapprovalof Iraq s division into three
 separate units These US missiles, supporting the Iraqi Kurds in their bid to
 remain a sovereign entity, ostensibly led to the much publicized
 beheading of Foley, the photojournalist who had travelled to
 Syria from Libya, where he had been kept by soldiers loyal to
 Muammar Gaddafi during a 44 day captivity in a bunch of
 prisons (2011), only to be captured by unidentified
 kidnappers in Syria nearly two years ago The unexpected suspect James Foley s video taped execution was released under the title
 A Message to America on 19 August In the video, Foley appears to
 relay a previously scripted monologue on the culpability of US
 foreign policy prior to being beheaded by a veiled figure using
 an apparently rather blunt knife This ghastly internet sensation
 caused global outrage, leading to his sister Kelly Foley to tweet Don t watch the video Don t share it That s not how life
 should be  The killer or executioner immediately became notorious for his
 own oration in a decidedly British accent: Any attempt by
 you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety
 under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your
 people His identity was soon discovered, as four days
 later, British Ambassador to the US, Sir Peter Westmacott, told
 CNN that he can t say more than this but I know from my
 colleagues at home that we are close, intimating the use of sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so
 on for the purpose of identifying and naming James Foley s
 alleged murderer It now turns out that the key suspect is an individual called
 Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, a 23 year old British former rapper
 (known also as L Jinny), who up and left his parental home in
 Maida Vale, West London in 2013 to join the jihad in Syria To
 his mind the young man appeared to have had a good reason to join
 the fight, as a well placed source [in US intelligence] told
 Fox News that Bary s Egyptian born father was extradited from
 London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to
 Osama bin Laden and the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Africa So, Bary allegedly beheading Foley could be a personal act of
 retribution for the young rapper turned beheader Using his blunt
 knife Abdel Bary interacted directly with three US Presidents 
 with Obama for having been in office at the time of his father s
 extradition (2012); with Bush, Jr for having taken the fight to
 Osama bin Laden, and thereby implicating his father who was known
 to have been one of the latter s top lieutenants (2002); and with
 Bill Clinton for having been in charge during the bombings of US
 Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and having subsequently
 identified Bin Laden as the main culprit (1998) Media in the West have since been filled with numerous voices
 expressing utter consternation at the considerable number of
 European (as well as American) volunteers who have apparently
 joined the ranks of the IS the BBC at the end of last year
 estimated their total troop numbers to consist of 3,000 to 5,000
 fighters Earlier this month, the lone man that is the Syrian
 Observatory for Human Rightsreportedthat another 6,300 men willing to fight had
 joined the Jihadi outfit in July While, just the other day, Colin Clarke, an associate political
 scientist at the Rand Corporation, came out claiming that that
 the total number of IS fighters is estimated to be about 10,000 
 Inside this main bulk of eager troops, the generally held
 consensus is that approximately 2,000 individuals hail from
 Europe, with a quarter of these young men Talking heads on television as well as the regular man and woman
 on the street seem perplexed and fail to understand why young
 men, born and bred in comfortable and arguably peaceful
 surroundings would abandon their easy lives to join a bloody
 fight in a remote location Dr Joshua Landis, an Associate
 Professor at the University of Oklahoma, reasons that the appeal
 of the IS (which has a very tech savvy social media propaganda
 apparatus at hand) is somewhat comparable to the allure the
 Spanish Civil War exerted on leftists of all stripe and color in
 the late thirties While it does seem reasonable to assume that
 joining the Jihad in Syria and Iraq has considerable romantic
 appeal for disenfranchised Muslim youths living in Europe, it
 seems to me that the underlying reason for this current minor
 people s migration to the east should be looked for in the actual
 conditions faced by these apparently fervent individuals Nearly four years ago, I argued elsewhere that current
 generations of Muslim migrants children and grandchildren daily
 face prejudice and intolerance Originally,
 these youngsters parents and grandparents were met with blatant
 racism and xenophobia, facing discrimination based upon
 their status as foreigners, foreigners from the backward East,
 speaking a different language and practicing a different
 religion  Nowadays in this post 9/11 world we live in, the vocabulary has
 changed yet the sentiments have remained the same As, commentators and politicians alike tend to forget national
 or ethnic identifiers, instead opting for religious markers, and
 thus speaking about the Muslims other present in  Europe 
 the Muslim other whose presence and actions are incompatible with
 Western civilization and alien to the Judeo Christian tradition
 which provides the framework for much, if not all, of Europe s
 culture and identity  The professor of sociology, scholar and expert in Islamic
 matters, Stefano Allievi rightly remarks that the immigrant
  has progressively become Muslim, both in his/her perception
 by the host societies and in his/her self perception And
 as a result, Europeans nowadays express their dislike of the other in religious and/or cultural terms, leading to
 the creation of a new term that is oftentimes not even
 associated with racist sentiments and/or reflexes: Islamophobia 
 But we should be clear about this: Islamophobia is nothing but a
 new name given to the age old reflex of racism  Children of Muslim parentage living in Western Europe as thus
 faced with Islamophobia or xenophobic racism on a daily basis; a
 circumstance which arguably leads to less than successful
 educational careers (oftentimes steered towards vocational or
 technical training), in turn followed by bleak job prospects and
 a culture of dependency (on either family or state provided
 assistance) Coupled to this less than rosy outlook is the fact that these
 young men more often than not succumb to sheer and utter boredom,
 arguably relieving their tedium with bouts of playing violent
 video games offering a temporary escape while boosting crumbled
 egos Societal pressure thus pushes these youngsters in the
 direction of Islam and, given parental and family background,
 these young men frequently embark on a journey of self discovery
 leading them to recognizing Jihad as their true cause making
 their empty lives full and meaningful But, the dead weight of
 the boredom faced by these young men does not always lead to a
 journey of religious self discovery, as attested by the recent

"4 Jul, 2014","Ukraine, the country no one cared about","Ukraine is the land where time has stood still and the consequences of what has been sown are now being reaped as anarchy is unleashed upon its rotting corpse Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Just over a year ago, in rather more peaceful times, I was on a
 train from Kharkov to Simferopol, sharing a cabin with two
 Russian gents from the Far Eastern outpost of Nakhodka and,
 breaking the monotony of long distance rail commutation, we were
 musing about the differences between Ukraine and Russia My travelling companions were journeying to visit close family
 who they hadn t met before unusual to European ears but
 understandable when the distance between their home and Crimea is
 about the same as that between Paris and Chicago The two Russians spoke effervescently about the kinship between
 the nations and the fraternal ties but they did notice how
 decrepit and haggard the country looked by comparison with their
 homeland What have these guys being doing for twenty years?
 Even the escalator stairs in Kharkov train station was broken, I
 asked the woman at the station and she said it stopped working in
 1995 but they never bothered to fix it, the older of the
 two, Sasha, told me I had noticed the ornamental escalator myself but as
 I d been in Ukraine many times before I was able to explain to my
 companions that the same bedraggled appearance and function was
 general all over the nation, so it hadn t surprised me Russia in the 90 s, they both exclaimed I had heard
 this before Ukraine is a place where time has stood still since
 1991 and basic services have been allowed to rot and decay while
 neighboring lands have made attempts to modernize In my view, this is the central reason that inspired the violent
 overthrow of the previous Ukrainian government at Maidan earlier
 this year It wasn t about the EU, the USA, Russia or NATO, it
 was prompted by frustration at 20 years of misrule by successive
 Ukrainian governments and by the Ukrainian people themselves who
 allowed it to happen As Bill Clinton s Presidential campaign
 mantra ed in the 90 s It s the economy, stupid  Now, sadly, as a consequence of Maidan, the economic situation
 has disintegrated to an even more calamitous level and Ukraine
 has over taken Moldova to gain the dubious honor of
 being Europe s poorest state when measured in average monthly
 incomes This is due to the almost complete breakdown of civil
 society and the collapse of the hryvnia currency following the revolution which has wiped out what little wealth
 households held According to Kiev s own figures, the average monthly net wage is
 now a paltry 173 a month This is almost four times less than in
 neighboring Poland and nine times lower than in Moscow 
 Meanwhile, the richest Ukrainian, Rinat Akhmetov has a personal
 fortune of $12 6 billion according to Forbes and the new
 President Petro Poroshenko sits on $1 3 billion Is it any wonder
 a large section of the public have had enough? Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; Mere anarchy is
 loosed upon the world, the blood dimmed tide is loosed, and
 everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned; the best lack
 all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate
 intensity, so wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats in
 1919 in his seminal The Second Coming Basically, bungling ineptitude, graft across all sectors of
 Ukrainian society and a general we don t care attitude
 has reduced Ukrainians to penury while adjoining states have
 improved their living standards since Communism fell over twenty
 years ago some faster than others Of course, not all
 Ukrainians are poor, a small upper class has prospered since
 independence and continued to drive ever better cars on ever more
 battered roads and flaunt more expensive watches opposite
 worsening and grinding poverty This broken down Ukraine is visible all over the fractured
 nation If one enters via Lviv, the Western fulcrum of
 nationalism, you can see the horrendous sight of elderly people
 eating from rubbish bins all around the beautiful city center and
 power outages are a regular occurrence In the industrial
 heartland of Krivoy Rog, the city is so badly lit at night, due
 to either lack of money or will, that you need a torch to walk
 the central streets In the southern port city of Odessa, the
 pulchritudinous Russian built center is literally crumbling
 either because of indifference or a shortage of cash to maintain
 the myriad exquisite architectural marvels What most would charitably call roads are non existent in places
 and even the artery from Lviv to the Polish border at Medyka
 (which is a major trading route) is in such disrepair that a 90km
 journey takes about two hours Internal routes are in such a
 sorry state that many have the appearance that asteroids have hit
 them, but in reality are just afflicted by gigantic potholes that
 nobody has bothered to repair Corruption is widespread in Eastern Europe but Ukraine seems to
 be unique in that it permeates down to even the lowest levels of
 society It is present everywhere, from the usual suspects like
 traffic police and city officials right down to schools and
 pension rights even the child of Chernobyl cards
 were being bought and sold some years back to enable holders to
 benefit from freebies Driving licenses are mostly bought, not
 earned and it is practically impossible to graduate school or
 university without greasing a teacher s palm Considering students in Ukraine, generally, buy their Degrees and
 Diplomas, rather than earn them, it is doubtful that those who
 protested at Maidan were actually aware of what they are
 protesting for, and I am not joking Most seemed unable to
 distinguish a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (the
 association deal), from an offer for EU membership which is
 another matter entirely Many of the protestors (especially the
 students) were under a misconceived fantasy that they would
 suddenly be allowed to emigrate to or at least travel freely to
 the more prosperous West This is not the case and was never on
 the cards In fact, the only country that appears to be opening
 its borders to Ukrainians fleeing the current Civil War is Russia
 the EU frontier remains slammed shut Contrast Ukraine s decay with Russia s resurgence Since the
 arrival of President Putin for his first term in 1999, and
 through the Medvedev years, and into Putin s second
 coming Russian GNI per capita has increased more than
 tenfold, from $1,272 to $13,711 and Russia s share ofEurope s GNI has jumped from 1 9% to 9 8% (Source 
 Kushnirs, for the record) Meanwhile, in the first 21 years of Ukrainian independence
 (1991 2012, their GNI fell from 10 1% of theEastern
 Europeantotal to 5 3% and real incomes have been static or
 even declined The situation is certainly even worse now,
 post Maidan With this in mind, is it any wonder that Crimeans
 are so overjoyed to have been re united with Russia and that a
 large percentage of the citizenry of South Eastern Ukraine envy
 them and would also wish to join the Russian Federation? During my frequent travels to Ukraine in recent years, I have
 built up a network of friends and acquaintances across the
 troubled territory and all of them have complained to me
 copiously about the economic damage wrought by Maidan Even some
 Western Ukrainians, who enthusiastically supported the movement
 at first, have grown weary as reality bites and they realize that
 things have gotten worse and not better and that the EU is not
 going to allow them free movement in the foreseeable future Of
 course, many of them believe it is a price worth paying for what
 they perceive to be progress but even they are
 frightened of what IMF enforced austerity will bring Concurrently, the mood in the South and East is rather less
 optimistic most of them did not approve of the initial protests
 and even those who did have had enough as the upheaval passes the
 three quarter of a year mark Tatyana from Nikolaev, who I first met in Kiev in 2010, left the
 capital after her company folded and returned to her home city in
 the spring She is currently pondering whether to join the
 110,000 Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Russia this year 
 not because her life is in danger but because she foresees a
 better future in Russia and sees the current state of chaos as an
 opportunity to move I spoke with her on Skype and she told me
 her reasons It s sad for me to realize this, but Ukraine doesn t exist
 anymore The rulers of our country, they stuffed their pockets
 with money, when they were in power all of them! That s all
 they ever did and nothing more They looted and sold out the
 whole country and now they have split and quarreled and are
 playing their games on the people, the ordinary people like me
 and I have had enough, she told me My Mother has told
 me to run to Russia but I do not have family there I do not know
 what to do I am scared At the other side of the country in Lviv, my friend Nikola is
 also scared But for a different reason he s been called up to
 the military and is awaiting deployment Recently, he messaged me
 frequently asking for help to relocate to Ireland he s an
 extremely talented computer programmer and they are in huge
 demand in Dublin On a personal level, I owe Nik a favor as he
 was inordinately helpful to me in Lviv a few years back I told
 him I was writing this piece and he agreed to answer a few
 questions I am a Ukrainian, I love this country and I love the
 language and I love the culture My whole root is Western Ukraine
 and Lviv is my heart I stood on Maidan last year and I loved the
 movement but it has been hijacked Now I see that the Americans
 were playing us all along and that this was never about Europe
 and Europe was my dream To bring it here, to be a part of it, to
 be a European  I am scared I am not a soldier and I don t want to fight I
 don t want to die for these politicians and I want to go back to
 my old work or escape I can be sent to the East to fight any day
 now and this is how I live in fear, he explained Nik added with genuine pain: The people in Donbas and
 Luhansk, they are Ukrainians like me and I don t want to kill
 them and I don t want to be killed by them either I want this to
 stop, to end Another acquaintance, Julia, from Odessa is out of work and
 barely scraping by she previous earned $700 a month as a
 translator for Marriage Tours (a not insignificant
 industry in the region) However, the hordes of (primarily)
 middle aged Americans and Brits have ceased coming due to the
 violence and the aspirant brides are lonely There is no
 work now at all I even tried the hotels, but they say foreign
 tourism to Odessa is gone this year and even the schools aren t
 hiring because nobody has money for English lessons most people
 can barely feed themselves, let alone work on their English
 vocabulary So many people are out of work What are they doing
 instead I ask? Many of them move to Russia and seek
 employment there, a small few went to Turkey to work without
 documents and the rest are just sitting on their sofas waiting
 for this madness to end When the delirious insanity does conclude and some measure of
 peace is restored to Ukraine and whether the South Eastern region
 eventually returns to Kiev s control or not, the scars will take
 years or even decades to heal There are the pockmarks of war, of
 course but the economic scabs will be harder to ameliorate once
 it s morning again in Ukraine and they awake from this
 long, dark night of the collective soul Ukraine has never been one nation in the way that
 other European states are, the fault lines have always been
 transparent But now that they have been opened and ruptured,
 it s doubtful they will readily repair In the economic sense, it is hard to see a great future for
 Ukraine The EU trade deal is only worth 490 million per annum 
 by contrast, trade with Russia and Belarus is valued at 16
 billion annually  and it is doubtful that Ukrainian goods will
 be able to compete on European markets in the first place Throw
 in the war damage to the already creaking infrastructure and the
 portents look very gloomy, not to mention the weariness of the
 population after the whole tumult What Ukraine needs now is not an EU association deal or an IMF
 austerity program; it s a Marshall Plan style aid package The EU
 is too preoccupied with troubled existing members like Greece to
 even contemplate such a move and the US, for all its big talk and
 promises, hasn t even so much as suggested such a move The only
 entity that might be willing and able to rescue Ukraine s economy is Russia (perhaps in partnership with China)
 but after the events of this year it s doubtful whether even
 their Slavic brothers would be prepared to take such a gamble now
 given the fractured state of relations I have no idea how Ukraine s turmoil will end exactly, but I m
 pretty certain it won t be good and that is a terrible shame It
 really is time to pray for Ukraine, not in the sense that the
 phrase was commandeered by Maidan supporters on social media, but
 for the populace who are suffering so much To paraphrase Yeats, who I quoted earlier, Romantic Ukraine

"3 Jul, 2014",âReal âBattle of Iraqâ is only beginning,"Ideology or religion, nationalism, self determination, and independence appear lofty notions and goals, but in reality, it is always about the oil, stupid! to paraphrase Professor Schwartz paraphrasing Bill Clinton Dr Can Erimtan is an independent scholar residing in Ä°stanbul, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East He attended the VUB in Brussels and did his graduate work at the universities of Essex and Oxford In Oxford, Erimtan was a member of Lady Margaret Hall and he obtained his doctorate in Modern History in 2002 His publications include the book Ottomans Looking West?  as well as numerous scholarly articles In the period 2010 11, he wrote op eds for Today s Zaman and in the further course of 2011 he also published a number of pieces in HÃ¼rriyet Daily News In 2013, he was the Turkey Editor of the Ä°stanbul Gazette He is on Twitter at@theerimtanangle Dr Can Erimtan is an independent scholar residing in Ä°stanbul, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East He attended the VUB in Brussels and did his graduate work at the universities of Essex and Oxford In Oxford, Erimtan was a member of Lady Margaret Hall and he obtained his doctorate in Modern History in 2002 His publications include the book Ottomans Looking West?  as well as numerous scholarly articles In the period 2010 11, he wrote op eds for Today s Zaman and in the further course of 2011 he also published a number of pieces in HÃ¼rriyet Daily News In 2013, he was the Turkey Editor of the Ä°stanbul Gazette He is on Twitter at@theerimtanangle The news cycles in the first decade of the 21st century were
 dominated by the military events in Iraq Following 9/11 the US
 government quickly decided that the time had finally come to
 invade Iraq (and reap its commercial benefits), even though the
 initial response was directed at Afghanistan As eloquently
 illustrated by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward, the real goal
 had always been the invasion of Iraq, with President George W 
 Bush meeting repeatedly with Army Gen Tommy R Franks and his
 war cabinet from December 2001 to plan the US attack on Iraq At the time, the US administration even allocated between $100
 and $200 million for covert operations in Iraq (compared to
 merely $70 million spent by the CIA in Afghanistan for similar
 purposes) Finally, Bush unleashed his campaign of Shock
 & Awe on 19 March 2003 and the subsequent invasion of
 the lands of Mesopotamia was completed on May, 1, when the US
 President announced that the mission had been completed It s
 hard to forget the iconic image of Bush, Jr , standing in front
 of a large banner displaying the words Mission
 Accomplished aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham
 Lincoln off the California coast Unashamed and full of bluster,
 from the podium Bush, Jr proclaimed that [m]ajor combat
 operations in Iraq have ended , adding that [i]n the
 Battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have
 prevailed  In truth, the real Battle of Iraq was only to start
 following the USS Abraham Lincoln announcement, ushering in a
 veritable civil war and the division of Iraq along ethnic and
 religious lines In 2006 the fragmentation of Iraq even led then Senator and now
 Vice President Joseph Biden (D Del) to pen a rather prescient
 op ed in the New York Times, in conjunction with co author Leslie
 H Gelb, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations 
 The piece proposed the idea to maintain a united Iraq by
 decentralizing it, giving each ethno religious group room to
 run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in
 charge of common interests, as a federal state consisting
 of a strong center and equally strong components Biden s piece
 effectively suggested the establishment of three largely
 autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad 
 The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible
 for their own domestic laws, administration and internal
 security The central government would control border
 defense  A first step in that direction had already been taken by the
 establishment of a no fly zone in northern Iraq following the
 completion of Operation Desert Storm (1991) Following the 2003
 invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the no fly zone
 ceased to exist and became officially known as the KRG or the
 Kurdistan Regional Government This de facto independent Kurdish
 state in northern Iraq has since then been at pains to establish
 good relations with its northern neighbor While Turkey, for its
 part, appears to have been equally willing to treat the KRG on
 equal terms, given Turkey s own restive Kurdish population (and
 the ongoing conflict with the terrorist PKK) and the KRG s
 hydrocarbon reserves that constitute an attractive incentive for
 maintaining friendly relations and good business partnerships With the advent of Ramadan this year, the ISIS, simultaneously
 active in Syria and Iraq, officially announced the arguably
 partial achievement of their goal even holding a parade in
 Syria s northern Raqqa province to celebrate their declaration of
 an Islamic caliphate after the group captured territory in
 neighboring Iraq, as reported by Reuters The ISIS is said
 to have renamed itself into the Islamic State Even though the
 report explains that Baghdadi has now been elevated to the
 position of head of the state , the use of the term Caliph really implies much wider aspirations The
 Arabic term Khalifah (transcribed into English as
 Caliph) literally denotes deputy or successor , and in the context of a Khilafat or Caliphate (as transcribed into English) refers to the
 succession of the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam and the
 first ruler of the Ummah or Community of Believers 
 Hence, the hardline Sunni Muslim group formerly known
 as ISIS in the West has now performed a cunning public relations
 exercise that at the same time is a threat to the legitimacy of
 the rulers of any state containing a Muslim population as well as
 an open invitation to anyone claiming to be a Muslim, as any
 believer should feel compelled to serve the Caliph ,
 who is the Leader of the Believers as the Shadow
 of God on Earth And, in a very post modern twist, Abu Bakr
 al Baghdadi even assumed his own caliphal name as the Caliph
 Ibrahim The Islamic State has now
 released yet another online video, posted on the Twitter
 account of the group s al I tisaam Media Foundation, called This is the Promise of Allah , and the recording
 shows the group s official spokesman Abu Muhammad al Adnani
 proclaiming: I say to the Islamic Ummah: Now we are in
 Iraq Allah, glorified and exalted smashed these borders,
 the borders of Sykes Picot, and now the Muslim can enter Iraq
 without a passport, as transcribed by the SITE
 Intelligence Group which keeps tracks on all dimensions of
 extremism in the 21st century  As a result, Iraq has now been divided into three parts, with the
 Sunni section being linked to parts of Syrian territory The
 Islamic State has now declared that nearly a century after the
 end of the Great War (better known as World War I, 1914 18) and
 the application of the Sykes Picot agreement (1916), dividing the
 territories of the erstwhile Ottoman Empire among the victors, a
 new world order has been established, or rather re established 
 The Islamic State seems bent on unmaking the results of the
 Sykes Picot agreement and redraw the map of the Middle East The
 group has apparently even posted a map of their ambitions online
 purportedly showing their plans for the next five years and
 this map shows vast swathes of Africa, the Middle East, and even
 Europe shaded in black, as indicative of territories the Caliph Ibrahim wants to rule The dismantling of Iraq into three separate entities would create
 a precedent that could very well also engulf the populations of
 the region The Islamic State s recent appearance on the Iraqi
 scene directly endangers the KRG, as a quasi autonomous Kurdish
 entity on Turkey s borders Even though, the KRG has been able to
 profit from the recent turmoil, adding more ground to its
 territory, but given that military gains and losses are seldom
 set in stone, the eventual outcome of the Islamic State s
 onslaught is still open to drastic and dramatic changes,
 reversals, setbacks and victories At the moment, for instance,
 the Islamic State is battling its erstwhile Syrian ally the Nusra
 Front for control of the city of Abu Kamal on Syria s eastern
 border with Iraq The Coventry based one man Syrian Observatory
 for Human Rights reports that the fighting has been escalating
 now for nearly a week The border town is located in the Syrian
 province of Deir ez Zor, which happens to be a region rich in
 oil, and thus one can see that even terrorist groups do not shy
 away from engaging in resource wars The Middle East is proverbial for its underground hydrocarbon
 wealth and Iraq is a land that swims on a sea of oil ,
 to use then US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz now
 infamous 2003 words With 140 billion barrels estimated, Iraq has
 the world s fifth largest proven oil reserves According to the US Energy
 Information Administration (EIA), Iraq has five
 super giant fields (over 5 billion barrels) in the south that
 account for 60 percent of the country s proven oil reserves An
 estimated 17 percent of oil reserves are in the north of Iraq,
 near Kirkuk, Mosul, and Khanaqin The International Energy
 Agency (IEA) estimated that the Kurdistan Regional Government
 (KRG) area contained 4 billion barrels of proven reserves 
 KRG stated that this region could contain 45 billion barrels of
 unproven oil resources As a result, the Islamic State s assault did not fortuitously
 start in Mosul, just beyond the so called Sunni Triangle (areas
 north and west if Baghdad which are not very rich in oil
 resources) But, according to Stony Brook Professor Michael
 Schwartz, the Sunni Triangle has almost the entire length of
 the only substantial pipeline that exits the country (to Turkey),
 a significant refinery in Haditha, and the Baiji petroleum
 complex, which contains an electrical power plant serving the
 northern provinces and a 310,000 barrel per day oil refinery
 producing a third of the country s refined petroleum , in
 addition to a number of small oil fields In other words, the Islamic State planned its attack in order to
 maximize the oil reserves held by Sunnis The sectarian Maliki
 government restricted the Sunni share of Iraq s oil revenue
 following the final departure of the US led occupation And now,
 Sunni extremist belonging to the terrorist group formerly known
 as ISIS, aided by erstwhile Saddam loyalist and members of Sunni
 militias known as Sahwa, originally recruited by the US to fight Al Qaeda but now abandoned by the Maliki government,
 as well as huge numbers of foreign fighters steaming in to join
 the Jihad in this live front in the intra Islamic Cold War, have
 forcibly taken hold of various oil assets Their possession is
 hotly contested and intensely fought over In the end, however
 bloody the fighting and however fierce the ideological opposition
 between Sunnis and Shi ites, [i]t has always been about the
 oil, stupid! according to Professor Schwartz paraphrasing
 Bill Clinton s speech writer James Carville Turkey, the direct successor to the Ottoman Empire in the region,
 is famously the one local without any substantial oil fields in
 its possession The fact that the Ottoman province of Mosul
 (originally part of Baghdad province, the area was given
 provincial status in 1878) was excluded from the territories held
 by Ankara in the Lausanne Treaty and assigned to the British
 Protectorate of Iraq has always been a source of great
 frustration on the Turkish side But now, the AKP led Turkish
 government has been establishing friendly ties with the KRG in
 northern Iraq, as a way of accessing oil wells beyond its
 borders The oil trade between Ankara and Erbil has been going
 strong now for a while, much to the chagrin of the central
 government in Baghdad however As such, Turkey has used its
 business relationship with the KRG to construct its own section
 of Pipelineistan in western Asia Now that ISIS in cooperation with erstwhile Saddam loyalists,
 Sunni militias, and innumerable foreign fighters from across the
 world, is in the process of effectively Balkanizing the state of
 Iraq, the ties between Turkey and the KRG appear as crucial as
 ever Particularly now that the Islamic State has gotten hold of
 Syrian territory actually bordering Turkey, in the Syrian town of
 Tal Abyad, facing the Turkish AkÃ§akale in the province of Urfa Even though the Islamic State has now brought the intra Islamic
 Cold War between Sunni and Shi a Islam to the forefront of global
 attention, underneath this ideological rhetoric and behind the
 bloody fighting resides the true prize of the vast hydrocarbon
 wealth hidden underneath the sand of the Middle East The sudden appearance of ISIS has also disrupted the recently
 revived and augmented oil trade between Ankara and Erbil This messy Iraqi Kurdistan/Turkey energy love affair had
 just started to bear fruits when Mosul fell Now that the ISIS in cooperation with erstwhile Saddam loyalists,
 Sunni militias, and innumerable foreign fighters from across the
 world, is in the process of effectively Balkanizing the state of
 Iraq, the ties between Turkey and the KRG appear as crucial as
 ever Quite apart from the messy Iraqi Kurdistan/Turkey energy
 love affair and global oil traders still having faith in
 the continued oil production in Iraq s South, another player also
 seems willing to intervene and in doing so, possibly upset the
 political tranquillity enjoyed by Turkey Recently, Israeli Prime
 Minister Binyamin Netanyahu declared that the Kurds are a
 nation of fighters and have proved political commitment and are
 worthy of independence In fact, a few days prior to Bibi s
 pronouncement, the Israeli FM Avigdor Lieberman had already told
 US Secretary of State John Kerry that the appearance of an
 independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq is all but a foregone conclusion In Turkey, a shaky Kurdish peace process has been underway for
 some years, initiated by ErdoÄan s overtly Islamic AKP Now that
 the likelihood of a full fledged Kurdish state, in lieu of a
 quasi autonomous KRG, on Turkey s borders appears like a real
 possibility, Turkey s authorities must feel a certain amount of
 apprehension A few days prior to Bibi s really rather unexpected endorsement
 of Kurdish statehood, the KRG s PM Nechirvan Barzani visited
 Turkey, where he met with the wily Foreign Minister Ahmet
 DavutoÄlu, the Energy Minister Taner YÄ±ldÄ±z, the National
 Intelligence Organization (MÄ°T) Undersecretary Hakan Fidan as
 well as Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirli, before
 getting together with Turkey s PM After all, Turkey is not just
 concerned over any possible oil deals with Iraq and the KRG, but
 at the same time the issue of the Turkish hostages held by the
 now Islamic State has not been resolved either As such, Barzani
 and ErdoÄan jointly called for the formation of a unity
 government in Iraq, an inclusive administration that will include
 all segments of Iraqi society Thus, the Israeli Netanyahu has now really thrown a considerable
 spanner in the works, an obstacle that could not just undermine
 Iraqi integrity but also jeopardize Turkey s Kurdish peace
 process But in reality, Bibi s remarks did not really fall from
 the sky It has been some years now that the state of Israel
 established an Israel Kurd Institute based in Iraqi Kurdistan as
 a think tank to foster relations between the Jewish state and the
 KRG In other words, Israel appears to have been harboring its own
 designs on the KRG s oil wealth for quite some time On Monday 23
 June, the Kurdish tanker SCF Altai unloaded its cargo at the
 Israeli oil port of Ashkelon The Israeli journalist Ksenia
 Svetlova explains that those who monitor Kurdish Israeli
 relations were not surprised The ties between Israel and the
 Kurds began in the early 1960s, when Israeli intelligence agents
 operated in Iraqi Kurdistan and helped local authorities The
 level of cooperation increased significantly after the fall of
 Saddam Hussein, with Israeli contractors and companies entering
 Iraqi Kurdistan and routine reports in Iraqi media about Israeli
 commandos training the Kurdish peshmerga These close links
 were however never officially acknowledged, and Svetlova
 recognizes that Israel is neither the closest nor the most
 important ally for any future Kurdish state, mentioning
 Turkey and Iran With the emergence of the Islamic State (or the
 terrorist group formerly known as ISIS) a number of previously
 quite hidden relationships have come out in the open Turkey,
 Syria, Iraq, and Iran are all inter linked due to their local
 Kurdish populations, and in combination with the hydrocarbon
 wealth wielded by some, Israel has been insinuating itself as
 well into that geographical fix as well The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/170204-real-iraq-battle-beginning/

 march on the capital With balaclavas pulled over their faces and
 on horseback their protest was primarily symbolic yet they
 inspired a new cycle of global protest against the unjust trade
 policies come to known as globalization  and free
 trade  At the time, the Zapatistas ideas appeared outlandish A free
 trade zone stretching from the Mexican Guatemalan border to the
 Canadian North Pole would bring growth, prosperity and jobs for
 all Twenty years later, it is safe to say that history has
 proven the Zapatistas right Poverty is rampant in Mexico More
 than 20 million Mexicanslivein food poverty , and 2 million
 farmers have beenforced to leavetheir land As a consequence
 nearly half a million Mexicans take the deadlyriskto migrate into the USA every year 
 North of the border an estimated 700,000 jobs have been lost in
 the US Five years later, the Zapatistas were no longer the only ones
 campaigning against free trade  On November 30, 1999,
 a powerful coalition of trade unionists and environmental
 activists Teamsters and Turtles brought inner city Seattle to
 a standstill so to shut down the World Trade Organization (WTO)negotiations In the years to follow, G20
 states such as Brazil and negotiators from poorer nations of the
 Global South joined in protest No longer was free
 trade  seen as a benevolent force by the majority of the
 world s population It is no surprise then that the Doha Round of
 the WTO has been indeadlock Though states have successfully
 circumvented this impasse Instead of pursuing multilateral trade
 agreements, states and free trading blocs such as the European
 Union (EU), states have moved toward bilateral trade agreements 
 For example, the EU has ratified 18 bilateral free tradeagreementssince 2001 For multinationals and bureaucratic elites on both sides of the
 Atlantic, TTIP appears to be a remedy against their prolonged
 economic woes Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the
 Unites States average 2 percent in annual economic growth are
 leaving itbehindthe BRICS It appears that the housing
 bubble, once the nation s engine of growth, has burst once and
 for all Today,pricesremain 15 percent below their peak
 value US capital is forced to find new areas of growth and
 expansion In the EU, member countries productivity rates cannot
 catch up with those of its economic powerhouseGermany, hence leading to unsustainable trade
 imbalances within the eurozone In countries like Spain and
 Greece, youth unemployment amounts to more than 55 percent At first sight, TTIP would boost exports from 14 US industrialsectors Yet, at a closer look these figures
 mean little given the high levels of export/import between the US
 and EU According to the Centre for Economic Policy Research
 which has the most optimistic calculations theestablishmentof this free zone 
 will lead to a 0 5 percent increase in growth in the EU and 0 4
 percent in the US respectively when fully implemented by 2027 
 This is an awfully high price to pay for such a miserable
 outcome It is a sick joke! While previous free trade 
 deals promised growth, jobs and prosperity, TTIP s only aim is to
 remain globally competitive against rising economic powers such
 as China, India and Brazil According to WTOestimates, customs duties average 3 5 percent
 in the US, and 5 2 percent in the EU To introduce free
 trade tackles the wrong problem Ulrike Herrman argues that
 the far bigger problem is currency speculation whichraises pricesof imports/exports: Up to
 USD 5 3 trillion are in use every day around the world to
 speculate on currencies By contrast, the entire world trade was
 only USD 18 4 trillion in 2012 that is, in a year Daily
 currency speculation has long since been disconnected from trade
 flows  In light of this, what is TTIP really about? Supposedly, it is
 about harmonization so that German or US
 car manufacturers no longer will need to produce both a European
 and American model Supposedly, it is about moving toward anew eraof innovation in manufacturing In
 reality, it is about a further redistribution of wealth in the
 interest of multinationals, finance capital and other capital
 fractions, popularly referred to as the one percent The fact that TTIP supporters on both sides of the Atlantic no
 longer make any grand claims, reveals that this deal is more
 about keeping the ideology of free trade alive than
 creating jobs, growth and prosperity The worries that the crisis
 would lead states to rediscover protectionism has beenunfounded The daily amount of products and services
 worth roughly 1 8 billion euros will continue to be exchanged
 between the US and Europe regardless whetherTTIPis enacted or not And it seems that opponents are on a good path of blocking TTIP s
 enactment despite the level of secrecy surrounding it So far,
 more than 700,000 citizens across the two continents have signed
 thepetitionagainst the plan At the beginning
 of the fifth round of negotiations, protesters assembled in
 Bruxelles Now civil society organizations, trade unions,
 environmental and religious groups are organizing toward a day ofactionon July 12 With the Doha Round of the WTO in deadlock, the
 Anti Counterfeiting and Copyright Agreement (ACTA) on ice, the
 odds are stacked against TTIP Unfortunately, opponents in the EU
 concentrate on the import of chlorine chicken from the US This
 misses the point that trade negotiators on both sides have made
 exemptions in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
 Only if opponents are willing to break up with these free
 trade deals once and for all can TTIP be defeated And if I
 have ever learnt anything from my ex girlfriend: The more
 promises broken, the easier the break up RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/167880-free-trade-eu-ttip/
"14 Jun, 2014",Cohen on Ukraine civil war: âLincoln didnât call Confederates terroristsâ,"Historical analogies may be inaccurate, but Americans may need to look at their own civil war and compare it to what is happening in Ukraine now Today the US supports a murderous criminal adventure that has little to do with unifying the country This assessment came
 from Professor Stephen Cohen, prominent US scholar of Russian
 studies and author, who advised George H W Bush in the late
 1980s Hespoke to RTabout the mistakes of the
 consecutive American administrations in their Russia policies,
 the worst crisis in decades that they led to and the
 deterioration of political discourse in America that prevents
 things from changing in Washington Cohen challenged the narrative of the Ukrainian events dominating
 in the US, calling the military crackdown by the government an unwise, reckless, murderous, inhuman campaign that Kiev is
 conduction against what are admittedly rebel provinces  Lincoln never called the Confederacy terrorists, the
 scholar pointed out He always [called them], no matter how
 bad the civil war was, fellow citizens he wanted to come back to
 the union Why is Kiev calling its own citizens terrorists? They
 are rebels They are protesters They have a political agenda 
 Why isn t Kiev sending a delegation there to negotiate with
 them? Their demands are not unreasonable They want to elect their
 own governors we elect our own governors They want a say on
 where their taxes go no taxation without representation We
 know what that is, Cohen said There are extremists
 among them, but there are also people who simply want to live in
 a Ukraine that is for everybody And instead the Kiev army, with
 the full support of the United States, is conducting this
 assault  What the US doing with Ukraine now is alienating arguably the
 best potential ally it has now, Cohen said I am convinced that the most essential partner for the
 American national security in all of these areas from Iran to
 Syria, Afghanistan and beyond is the Kremlin, currently occupied
 by Putin And the way the United States has treated Putin I
 would call it a betrayal of American national interest  Russia helped the Obama administration save its face in Syria,
 where the president was pushed into bombing the country over
 chemical weapons It helped make bridges with the new leadership
 of Iran to start the first serious negotiations in decades Obama had within his grasp at last because it was a failed
 foreign policy presidency for Obama two achievements that would
 have been in American national interest And they have slipped
 away almost in proportion to the degree that Obama pushed Putin
 away Pushed Putin away so far that over Ukraine we [the US]
 could be on the verge of war with Russia  Cohen blames the US, particularly the Clinton administration for
 setting the world on a path that led it to the current
 confrontation between the West and Russia This is the playing out of American policy of expanding NATO
 to Russia s borders for whatever reasons It began with
 Clinton, was continued under the second George Bush, has been
 pushed by Obama And that is the rooster that has come home to
 roost  Some people in the 1990s warned that this was going to
 happen Now it has, and the people would not take responsibility
 for it, he said They would not say OK, we were
 wrong, we have to rethink policy Instead they say to people
 such as myself, You are an apologist for Putin You are serving
 the Kremlin, you are not a patriot  This lack of ability to change policies is evident in the current
 administration, the scholar believes I had lunch with two men much older than me, who had served
 many presidents and who ve known them personally And they were
 agreed that this president more than anyone in their lifetime
 isolated himself on foreign policy  One anecdotal example Cohen cited is Obama s refusal to talk to
 former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger I have heard whether it s true or not I don t know that
 President Obama has declined to meet privately with Henry
 Kissinger, who sees Putin twice a year Kissinger probably knows
 Putin better than any American statesmen alive today and who has
 been consulted by so many presidents Think what we might about
 Kissinger s past, but he has already declared his criticism of
 American policy towards Russia And Obama wouldn t want to spend
 an hour with him, asking Are we doing something wrong? Are we
 misperceiving the situation?  It s no surprise that a leader, who doesn t take into account
 various viewpoint on a problem cannot take a rational decision on
 tackling it, Cohen said I ask for a president to be a person, who solicits the best
 and most diverse learned views involving an existing crisis,
 that s all A president has to bring in people with conflicting
 views whose legitimacy is based on their knowledge, their
 learning A president who doesn t do that is going to get us into
 a crisis that Obama and Clinton got us into  Unfortunately for America, it s not only the White house that
 discourages debate now, but also American society in general, the
 professor said There is no debate or public opposition in this country
 about this, unlike the situation 20 25 years ago, when we had
 real debates and public fights, he said I don t know
 if they [the mainstream media RT] know the truth and therefore
 are not telling the truth, or that they are just caught up in the
 myths that had been attached to Russia since the end of the
 Soviet Union  An orthodoxy about Russia has formed in this country over 20
 years, he added And it s not only wrong, it s
 reckless It led us to this crisis in Ukraine The only way you
 can break orthodoxy is with heresy Some of the things I say are
 regarded as heretical, treasonous, unpatriotic But heresy is a
 good thing, when it s needed  This situation is a sharp contrast to what happens in some other
 democracies, which don t hush a public debate on foreign policy
 issues and don t try to push opinions not liked by the political
 establishment into the fringe press Germany, a relatively new democracy with a past as bad as
 Russia s, could develop a democracy, where people can speak
 openly and freely without fear of failing to get a promotion or
 getting on an op ed page Two or three former German chancellors
 have blamed Europe for the crisis in Ukraine not Russia  Where are our former presidents? We know why President
 Clinton wouldn t speak out, because he began that policy But
 where is President Carter? Where are the former secretaries of
 state who pursued other policies? Why the silence? We ve
 developed, I fear, a political culture within the establishment
 that is conformist Even though the penalty of dissent in our
 country is cheap, unlike in many other countries  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/165932-lincoln-confederates-terrorists-ukraine/
"5 Jun, 2014","Putin speaks out on Ukraine, Crimea and US relations with French media","Russian President Vladimir Putin has given a major interview to French media on pressing international issues Ukraine, Crimea, US relations and Russia s future policies on the eve of attending the 70th anniversary D Day celebrations in France Putin voiced his stance on many issues that have been in the
 center of international attention for the past months in an
 exclusive interview to Radio Europe 1 and TF1 TV at his Sochi
 residence They included Russia s stance on Ukraine s sovereignty
 and the ongoing crisis, and on Crimea, its referendum and its
 historical ties to Russia Putin also discussed the political
 tensions between Moscow and Washington, Syria and its recent
 presidential elections, Russia and its domestic policies Question:Good afternoon Mr
 President Good afternoon, President Putin Thank you very much
 for agreeing to give this exclusive interview to Radio Europe 1
 and the TF1 TV channel at your Sochi residence On Thursday
 evening you will meet with President Francois Hollande in the
 Elysee Palace, and the next day you will attend the D Day 70th
 Anniversary Commemoration This will be your first trip to the
 beaches of Normandy, and you will be the first Russian President
 to attend the ceremony What do you as a Russian citizen think
 about being invited to this exceptional ceremony? Vladimir Putin:This will be an important event
 for Europe and the rest of the world We will pay tribute to
 those who prevented Nazism from enslaving Europe, and I believe
 that Russia s attendance is a momentous event The thing is that
 Russia and the anti Hitler coalition countries, including France,
 were allies in that struggle for freedom, and my country played a
 vital and maybe even the decisive role in defeating Nazism But
 we ll never forget the French Resistance fighters and the French
 soldiers who fought side by side with us on the Soviet German
 front, which is also called the Eastern front I believe that
 this should not only remind us about our history, but also help
 to promote our relations now and in the future Q:Of course, you and Russia will take your
 rightful place on the beaches of Normandy You lived in the
 Soviet Union until you were 40, you saw its collapse, and now you
 are actively contributing to Russia s revival What would you
 like to see happen now? What are your goals? Is Russia s strategy
 a path of dialogue or expansion and conquest? VP:Well, a policy of expansionism and conquest
 has no future in the modern world We re confident that Russia
 can and should be a partner with its traditional allies, in the
 broad sense, now and also in the future This is what we want, and this is what we will keep working
 towards We see no other way to develop relations with our
 neighbours and all other countries Q:Do you want to defend the Russian nation
 or to become the symbol of Russian nationalism and the Russian
 Empire? We remember what you said about the Soviet Union s
 dissolution You said that it was the worst geopolitical disaster
 of the 20th century You also said that those who do not regret
 the collapse of the Soviet Union have no heart, and those who
 want to restore it have no brains You have brains What do you
 propose: Russian nationalism, or the restoration of the Russian
 Empire to its previous borders? VP:We will not promote Russian nationalism, and
 we do not intend to revive the Russian Empire What did I mean
 when I said that the Soviet Union s collapse was one of the
 largest humanitarian above all humanitarian disasters of the
 20th century? I meant that all the citizens of the Soviet Union
 lived in a union state irrespective of their ethnicity, and after
 its collapse 25 million Russians suddenly became foreign
 citizens It was a huge humanitarian disaster Not a political or
 ideological disaster, but a purely humanitarian upheaval 
 Families were divided; people lost their jobs and means of
 subsistence, and had no means to communicate with each other
 normally This was the problem Q:And what about the future?Do
 you want to restore the empire within the former borders or do
 you want to continue developing your country within your own
 borders? VP:We want to develop our country within our
 own borders, of course But and this is very important like
 other countries in other parts of the world, we want to use
 modern policies to improve our competitive advantage, including
 economic integration This is what we are doing in the
 post Soviet space within the Customs Union and now also within
 the Eurasian Union Q:Mr Putin, we are now talking about why a
 neighbouring country, Ukraine, is being torn apart by war There
 is no other word for it Now pro Russian forces want to breach
 Ukraine s borders Who can stop them and what is your
 policy? VP:I wouldn t call them either pro Russian or
 pro Ukrainian They are people who have certain rights,
 political, humanitarian rights, and they must have a chance to
 exercise those rights For example, in Ukraine governors are still appointed by Kiev 
 After the anti constitutional coup in Kiev last February, the
 first thing the new authorities tried to do was deprive the
 ethnic minorities of the right to use their native language This
 caused great concern among the people living in eastern Ukraine Q:You did not let this happen but are you
 saying that we are on the verge of another Cold War? VP:I hope we are not on the verge of any war 
 Second, I insist that people wherever they live have their
 rights and they must be able to fight for them That s the point Q:Is there any risk of a war? Now, as we
 see tanks on their way from Kiev, many people in France are
 asking this question Were you tempted to send troops to eastern
 Ukraine? VP:This is an interview, which implies short
 questions and short answers But if you have patience and give me
 a minute, I will tell you how we see it Here s our position 
 What actually happened there? There was a conflict and that
 conflict arose because the former Ukrainian president refused to
 sign an association agreement with the EU Russia had a certain
 stance on this issue We believed it was indeed unreasonable to
 sign that agreement because it would have a grave impact on the
 economy, including the Russian economy We have 390 economic
 agreements with Ukraine and Ukraine is a member of the free trade
 zone within the CIS And we wouldn t be able to continue this
 economic relationship with Ukraine as a member of the free trade
 zone We discussed this with our European partners Instead of
 continuing the debates by legitimate and diplomatic means, our
 European friends and our friends from the United States supported
 the anti constitutional armed coup This is what happened We did
 not cause this crisis to happen We were against this course of
 events but after the anti constitutional coup let s face it,
 after all Q:But now we see so much tension in
 politics Yet despite this, you will be in Normandy speaking
 about peace while Barack Obama keeps urging Europe to arm
 itself VP:Well, we must always talk about peace but we
 should understand the causes and nature of the crisis The point
 is no one should be brought to power through an armed
 anti constitutional coup, and this is especially true of the
 post Soviet space where government institutions are not fully
 mature When it happened some people accepted this regime and
 were happy about it while other people, say, in eastern and
 southern Ukraine just won t accept it And it is vital to talk
 with those people who didn t accept this change of power instead
 of sending tanks there, as you said yourself, instead of firing
 missiles at civilians from the air and bombing non military
 targets Q:But, Mr President, the United States and
 the White House claim they have evidence that Russia intervened
 in the conflict, sent its troops and supplied weapons They claim
 they have proof Do you believe that? VP:Proof? Why don t they show it? The entire
 world remembers the US Secretary of State demonstrating the
 evidence of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction, waving around
 some test tube with washing powder in the UN Security Council 
 Eventually, the US troops invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein was hanged
 and later it turned out there had never been any weapons of mass
 destruction in Iraq You know, it s one thing to say things and
 another to actually have evidence I will tell you again:no
 Russian troops Q: Are you saying the US is lying? VP:There are no armed forces, no Russian
 instructors in southeastern Ukraine And there never were any Q: So you do not want to annex Ukraine and
 you never tried to destabilise the situation there? VP:We never did that The Ukrainian government
 must now sit down and talk with their own people instead of using
 weapons, tanks, planes and helicopters They must start the
 negotiating process Q: The new Ukrainian president was elected
 on May 25 through a democratic vote Do you recognise Mr
 Poroshenko as a legitimate president? VP:I ve already told you and will say it again:
 we will respect the choice of the Ukrainian people and we will
 cooperate with Ukrainian authorities Q:In other words, if you meet him on 6 June
 on the beaches of Normandy, and if President Hollande helps to
 make this meeting possible, will you shake hands with him? Will
 you talk with him? VP:You know, I don t plan to evade anyone 
 President Hollande kindly invited me as the representative of
 Russia to attend this commemoration, even though the event it
 will commemorate was tragic I was pleased to accept his
 invitation, and I m grateful to the President for inviting me 
 There will be other guests, and I m not going to avoid any of
 them I will talk with all of them Q:But will you meet with Poroshenko? You
 said you would only work with him on the condition that he would
 not totally yield to US influence VP:I didn t say that he shouldn t yield to US
 influence He is free to accept any influence he wants 
 Ukrainians voted for him, and he is free to develop a policy If
 he chooses to accept anyone s strong influence, let him But I
 wouldn t Q:Do you recognize Ukraine s sovereignty
 and its neutral stance with respect to relations between Russia
 and the West? VP:Yes, we recognize its sovereignty Moreover,
 we d like Ukraine to act as a sovereign state Joining any
 military bloc or any other rigid integration alliance amounts to
 a partial loss of sovereignty But if a country opts for this and
 wants to cede part of its sovereignty, it s free to do so 
 Regarding Ukraine and military blocs, this is what worries us,
 because if Ukraine joins, say, NATO, NATO s infrastructure will
 move directly towards the Russian border, which cannot leave us
 indifferent Q:Mr President, Russian troops annexed
 Crimea recently Will you ever give it back? VP:It s a delusion that Russian troops annexed
 Crimea Russian troops did nothing of the kind Frankly Q:But Crimea has been included on the map
 of Russia, the kind of maps we used in school It s part of
 Russia now What was it, annexation or reunification? Which word
 should we use? VP:If you ll let me finish, I think you ll see
 what I mean Russian troops were in Crimea under the international treaty on
 the deployment of the Russian military base It s true that
 Russian troops helped Crimeans hold a referendum on their (a)
 independence and (b) desire to join the Russian Federation No
 one can prevent these people from exercising a right that is
 stipulated in Article 1 of the UN Charter, the right of nations
 to self determination Q:In other words, you will not return
 Crimea [to Ukraine]?Crimea is Russia, is that it? VP:In accordance with the expression of the
 will of people who live there, Crimea is part of the Russian
 Federation and its constituent entity I want everyone to understand this clearly We conducted an
 exclusively diplomatic and peaceful dialogue I want to stress
 this with our partners in Europe and the United States In
 response to our attempts to hold such a dialogue and to negotiate
 an acceptable solution, they supported the anti constitutional
 state coup in Ukraine, and following that we could not be sure
 that Ukraine would not become part of the North Atlantic military
 bloc In that situation, we could not allow a historical part of
 the Russian territory with a predominantly ethnic Russian
 population to be incorporated into an international military
 alliance, especially because Crimeans wanted to be part of
 Russia I am sorry, but we couldn t act differently Q:So, Francois Hollande has invited you to
 France, to Paris and Normandy You know him very well Can you
 move further forward, and can you describe your relations as
 confidential? VP:Yes, I think so Q:Do you think so, or are you sure? VP:I ve always thought so I see no reasons to
 think otherwise We have very good interstate relations, but we
 have much to do yet to promote our economic ties But our personal relations have always been trust based, which
 helps in work as well I hope it will stay this way Q: You are talking about trust based
 relations both in defense and the economy You have paid over a
 billion euros for two Mistral class amphibious assault ships, and
 Russian naval officials are to visit Saint Nazaire in a few days 
 Have you given them special permission to go to France? VP:I believe we are living in a civilized world
 and we will all continue to fulfill our obligations and
 contractual commitments I ve heard a lot of talk about these
 ships going to Russia and some people believe that Russia
 shouldn t get them You know, here in Russia we had a lot of
 opposition to this contract France is entitled to decide against
 selling the ships, but in that case we should get out money back 
 This would mean that out countries won t have an opportunity to
 develop ties in the defense sector but overall we are ready to
 expand our cooperation and even to place new orders, if our
 French partners are interested Q: Despite external pressure, you have asked
 France to supply these assault ships and if France does it you
 may place other orders as well, right? VP:We expect our French partners to fulfill
 their contractual obligations, and if everything goes as we
 agreed, we will not rule out the possibility of further orders 
 and not necessarily in naval shipbuilding; they may concern other
 sectors as well Overall, our relations in this area are
 developing well, and we would like to continue strengthening them
 in aviation, shipbuilding, and other sectors We have
 successful cooperation experience in space exploration, at the
 Guiana Space Centre near Kourou Q: Do you think France is a sovereign and
 independent state whose opinion is respected? What do you think
 of Germany? You speak with Angela Merkel in both Russian and
 German, while FranÃ§ois Hollande doesn t speak Russian and you
 don t speak French Do you have a common language of
 communication? VP:The fact that I don t speak French and Mr
 Hollande doesn t speak Russian is not a barrier for us It does
 not prevent us from speaking a common language, and we understand
 each other well even via an interpreter Speaking of the level of sovereignty, I will say it again any
 country that becomes a member of a military alliance gives away
 some of its sovereignty to a supranational body For Russia, this
 would be unacceptable As for other countries, it has nothing to
 do with us They have to decide such matters for themselves In
 this regard, I think of the Gaullist tradition and General
 Charles de Gaulle, who protected France s sovereignty I think
 this deserves respect And there s another example: FranÃ§ois
 Mitterrand, who spoke of European confederation, with Russia as
 its member I think this opportunity still exists and we will
 have it in the future Q: My next question concerns the United
 States You will meet with Barack Obama in a few days, you will
 sit a few metres away from him But he doesn t seem to be willing
 to speak to you What will this meeting be like and how will
 relations develop between the world s richest country and its
 largest country? How can you avoid speaking to each other when
 there s a real need for this since the war is not too far
 off? VP:Well, you re exaggerating about the war
 being not far off You seem to be feeling aggressive Whatever
 gave you this idea, and why are you determined to frighten us
 all? As for Q: Because Ukraine is near Russia VP:So what? Q: And this is where the war is going on 
 When he mentioned the war, he said it is not far off VP:There is a punitive operation launched by
 Kiev s government against the country s own citizens It is not a
 war between states, it is something entirely different As for Q: Do you think it should be stopped
 immediately? VP:I think Mr Poroshenko, who has no blood on
 his hands so far, has a unique chance to halt this punitive
 operation now and start a dialogue with people in southeastern
 Ukraine As for my relations with Barack Obama, I have no reason
 whatsoever to believe he is not willing to talk to the President
 of Russia But ultimately, it is his choice I am always ready
 for dialogue, and I think that dialogue is the best way to bridge
 any gaps We have been in contact until now, we have talked on
 the telephone regularly Q: Russia and the United States are
 experiencing some problems Are these problems between two powers
 or between two people, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin? VP:Problems between countries always exist,
 especially between such big countries as Russia and the United
 States There have always been some issues, but I don t think we
 should go to extremes At any rate, it wouldn t be our choice 
 I m always willing to talk to any of my partners, including
 President Obama Q: So you are willing to talk and you regret
 what is happening? But don t you think the United States is
 trying to surround Russia, to make you weaker as a leader and
 perhaps isolate you from the world? You are being very diplomatic
 now but you know the facts VP:Facts? You ve said it yourself: Russia is
 the biggest country in the world It would be very difficult to
 surround it, and the world is changing so fast that it would
 basically be impossible, even in theory Of course, we can see attempts by the United States to pressure
 their allies by employing their obvious leadership in the Western
 community, in order to influence Russia s policy Russia s policy is based solely on its national interests Of
 course, we take the opinions of our partners into account but we
 are guided by the interests of the Russian people Q: Mr President, it is very convenient that
 you are meeting with Mr Obama on June 6 Perhaps, it would be
 worse if you were meeting with Hillary Clinton Only a few days
 ago, she said that what Russia is doing in Eastern Europe
 resembles what Hitler was doing in the 1930s VP:It s better not to argue with women But Ms
 Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements Still, we
 always met afterwards and had cordial conversations at various
 international events I think even in this case we could reach an
 agreement When people push boundaries too far, it s not because
 they are strong but because they are weak But maybe weakness is
 not the worst quality for a woman Q: Women must be respected, of course, and
 I m sure you respect them Do you think she went too far? There
 is a lot of mockery and cartoons in the media including those
 showing you What was your first reaction? Were you angry? Did
 you want to get back at her or laugh? We have never seen you
 laugh VP:Someday I will indulge myself and we will
 laugh together at some good joke But when I hear such extreme
 statements, to me it only means that they don t have any valid
 arguments Speaking of US policy, it s clear that the United
 States is pursuing the most aggressive and toughest policy to
 defend their own interests at least, this is how the American
 leaders see it and they do it persistently There are basically no Russian troops abroad while US troops are
 everywhere There are US military bases everywhere around the
 world and they are always involved in the fates of other
 countries even though they are thousands of kilometres away from
 US borders So it is ironic that our US partners accuse us of
 breaching some of these rules Q:But you have taken some decisions
 regarding your defense budget Are you as President taking any
 special decisions on security and defense now, because the
 general environment is more risky? VP:Regarding the defense budget I d like to
 say, for reference sake, because only the analysts know this,
 that the defence budget of the United States, which we talked
 about only yesterday, is larger than the combined military
 budgets of every country in the world every country combined 
 So who s pursuing an aggressive policy? As for our [defense] budget, it has hardly grown in terms of
 percent of GDP, barely by one tenth of a percent But we want to
 rearm our army and navy based on modern, advanced technology, by
 reducing quantity and improving quality We have a relevant
 rearmament programme, and it was not adopted yesterday or in
 response to the Ukrainian crisis It has been our policy, which
 we will continue to implement Q:Mr President, Syrian leader Bashar Assad
 has been re elected president without much effort Can you
 influence him? Can you ask him to order his army to stop its
 atrocities, to stop fighting their own people? VP:All sides are guilty of atrocities there,
 but primarily the extremist organizations that are thriving in
 Syria We are mostly worried about Q:Religious, Islamic [organizations] VP: those organizations that are directly
 connected with Al Qaeda There are many of them there, which no
 one tries to deny any longer It s a general fact But we are
 mostly worried that the wrong action could turn Syria into
 another Afghanistan, a completely uncontrollable spawning ground
 for the terrorist threat, including for European countries All
 the terrorists who are operating there now would eventually move
 to other countries, including in Europe Q:We don t quite understand why you,
 Vladimir Putin, the man who wants to modernize Russia, support a
 person who is killing his own people, who is covered in their
 blood How can this be? VP:I ll explain very simply and clearly, and I
 hope that the majority of the French people who are watching and
 listening to this interview will understand me We very much fear
 that Syria will fall apart like Sudan We very much fear that
 Syria will follow in the footsteps of Iraq or Afghanistan This
 is why we would like the legal authority to remain in power in
 Syria, so that Russia can cooperate with Syria and with ours
 partners in Europe and the United States to consider possible
 methods to change Syrian society, to modernize the regime and
 make it more viable and humane Q:I d like to ask you about your country,
 Russia How would you describe its current political regime? Some
 describe it as a democracy, while others argue that Russia is so
 huge that it needs an iron hand How does Vladimir Putin define
 the Putin regime? VP:The current regime is not connected to any
 particular person, including the incumbent President We have
 common democratic state institutions, although they reflect
 Russia s needs What are they? The overwhelming majority of
 Russian citizens tend to rely on their traditions, their history
 and, if I may say so, their traditional values I see this as the
 foundation and a factor of stability in the Russian state, but
 none of this is associated with the President as an individual 
 Moreover, it should be remembered that we only started
 introducing standard democratic institutions recently They are
 still in the process of evolving Q:Can a person stand in opposition to the
 authorities in Russia without fear of losing his ties and
 reputation, without being punished? VP:We have many opposition parties, and we have
 recently liberalized the procedure for registering political
 parties We have dozens of parties that participate in municipal
 and regional elections Q: But is it possible to be a personal
 opponent of Vladimir Putin without exposing oneself to
 risks? VP:If you listen to some of our radio stations
 and watch some TV shows, I assure you, you are unlikely to find
 anything similar to this kind of opposition in France Q: There have always been periods of strict
 order and authoritarian power in Russia But in the age of the
 Internet, can a country develop by restricting freedoms? VP:It is impossible and we are not restricting
 the Internet We have certain You know, whatever we do, someone
 tries to find something that goes against democratic principles,
 including the Internet Are there any restrictions in Russia? I
 don t believe so Some of our opponents say there are
 unacceptable restrictions What kind of restrictions do we have?
 For example, we have banned the promotion of suicide, drugs and
 pedophilia These are our restrictions What s wrong with that? Q: And homosexuality It is not pedophilia,
 it s a different story VP:That s not true, we did not ban
 homosexuality We banned the promotion of homosexuality among
 minors You see, these are two different things In the United
 States, since we talked about it, homosexuality is illegal in
 some states We impose no criminal liability whatsoever We
 banned only promoting homosexuality among minors It is our right
 to protect our children and we will do it Q: We would like to talk about the end of
 your term in 2018 We would like to talk about labor camps We
 find such things surprising in the West For example, Pussy Riot
 were sentenced to a term in labor camps, and it wasn t just an
 ordinary prison Will you close those camps by the end of your
 term? VP:These are not camps These are places where
 the inmates freedom is limited but they can live a more or less
 normal life These are not prisons where people are not allowed
 to work Prisons where people can t even work is the worst punishment you
 can think of And I don t think we should put all convicts in
 such facilities where people are deprived of their freedom I
 think it is much worse than what you are describing Q: Who convinced you that you are carrying
 out a special mission for Russia? VP:Why do you think that I believe I m carrying
 out a special mission? I have the trust of my voters Over 63% of
 Russian citizens voted for me I believe I hold a national
 mandate to carry out domestic and foreign policy, and I will
 fulfill my obligations under this mandate Q: Do you have a role model in the Russian
 history? Are you guided by Soviet or Russian politics? VP:I have great love and respect for Russian
 history and culture But the world is changing and Russia is too 
 Russia is part of the modern world, not the world of the past but
 the modern world And I believe it has an even greater future
 than some other countries that can t take care of their young
 people, of the new generations, of their children, and believe
 that they can just let things slide Q: And the last question, Mr President In
 2013, Forbes rated you as the most powerful person in the world 
 Were you flattered by this title? VP:You know, I m an adult and I know what power
 means in the modern world In the modern world, power is mainly
 defined by such factors as the economy, defense and cultural
 influence I believe that in terms of defense, Russia is without
 any doubt one of the leaders because we are a nuclear power and
 our nuclear weapons are perhaps the best in the world With regard to cultural influence, we are proud of the Russian
 culture literature, the arts and so on As for the economy, we are aware that we still have a lot to do
 before we reach the top Although lately, we have made major
 strides forward and are now the fifth largest economy in the
 world It is a success but we can do more Q: We don t know yet how Vladimir Putin s
 era will go down in history What would you like to be remembered
 for? And would you like to be seen as a democrat or an
 authoritarian leader? VP:I would like to be remembered as a person
 who did his best for the happiness and prosperity of his country
 and his people Q: Thank you very much Have a good trip to
 France, Mr President Good bye VP:Thank you RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/official-word/163912-putin-interview-french-media/
"17 Mar, 2014",Westward march of Chinese Dragon in Eurasia,"As the US militarily pivots into the Asia Pacific, the Chinese steadily march westward simply through trade oriented construction and economic projects The Chinese have finished the construction of a major tunnel that
 is part of a mountain transport corridor from Turpan to Kurla
 that is linked to Pakistan The corridor is part of the extension
 of the Karakoram Highway that is part of a project to
 re integrate the westernmost portion of the People s Republic of
 China with the areas of Eurasia to its west Beijing has been setting up its own transportation infrastructure
 and energy pipelines in Eurasia, and the infrastructure being
 built will be the engine of an economic renaissance that is
 unfolding The Chinese now have a presence all around the old
 Silk Road and the ancient maritime trade routes in the Indian
 Ocean that sold spices and precious metals China has been busy building deep sea ports, holding bays,
 railroads, highways, tunnels, and transportation hubs throughout
 these regions Despite US pressure and attempts to militarize and control the
 Indian Ocean s shipping lanes, the Chinese have been busy setting
 up an infrastructure network stretching all the way to Gwadar,
 close to the Persian Gulf, in Pakistan and Hambantota in Sri
 Lanka from Chittagong in Bangladesh and Kyaukphyu in Myanmar While the US watches with displeasure from the sidelines, these
 Chinese projects are weaving the fabrics of Eurasian integration The US has tried and is continuing to try to weaken China 
 Washington s attempts at weakening China have included exploiting
 the ethnic tensions and cleavages between the Han Chinese, which
 compose the majority of the Chinese population, and China s
 non Han citizens This includes stoking tensions in East
 Turkestan between the Han and the predominantly Muslim
 Turkic speaking Uyghur indigenous population in the autonomous
 region of Xinjiang The US has also continuously pushed for protests and secession in
 Tibet Although the Dalai Lama and his government in exile claim
 that the unrest was the result of discontent with Beijing, US
 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) teams, US planning and CIA
 training were all involved in sparking and manipulating the
 Tibetan unrest that erupted in Lhasa on the eve of the 2008
 Beijing Summer Olympics The Han and predominately Muslim Hui, an
 ethnic group comprised essentially of Hans that have mixed with
 Silk Road travelers and traders over the millennia, were targeted
 and killed during this wave of anti Beijing unrest During the American Anthropological Association s 110th Annual
 Meeting in 2011 (running from November 16 to November 20 in
 MontrÃ©al), one anthropologist even admitted that for research
 purposes that they were given privileged access to the CIA s
 training program that ignited the 2008 unrest in Tibet The CIA even has training camps for Tibetan guerillas on American
 soil, away from public eyes in the Rocky Mountains Despite Washington s rejections, there is also a body of
 literature that candidly discusses Washington s covert Tibet
 operations The Tibetan activist Jamyang Norbu wrote a chapter in
 a book published in 1994 and edited by Columbia University
 professor and Tibet specialist Robert Barnett, Resistance and
 Reform in Tibet, openly detailing the CIA s role in Tibet against
 the Chinese government The Tibetan Resistance Movement and the
 Role of the CIA is the title of Norbu s particular chapter More
 recent literature includes the University Press of Kansas book by
 Kenneth Conboy and former CIA agent James Morrison that was
 published in 2002, The CIA s Secret War in Tibet These authors
 all openly reveal how the US has waged a covert war against China
 by encouraging Tibetan secession and controlling the heart of the
 Tibetan guerilla movement fighting against Beijing Washington has been pushing for trouble between China and the
 countries bordering China in the South China and East China Seas US officials dream of rebooting the Southeast Asian Treaty
 Organization (SEATO) too SEATO is the defunct NATO of East Asia that was supposed to
 expand in parallel with the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations (ASEAN), just as NATO and the European Union have
 expanded hand in glove over in Europe on the western portion of
 Eurasia There is also the Asiatic segment of the global missile shield
 project that the Pentagon is building next to China s heavily
 populated eastern borders This is part of a Eurasian strategy of
 encirclement that targets both China and Russia alike This brings us to the so called Asian Pivot that Hillary
 Clinton announced in 2011 when she claimed that the US was
 pivoting towards the Asia Pacific region and away from the Middle
 East and NATO garrisoned Afghanistan Beijing did not buy any of it China knows better The US has no
 intentions of leaving the Middle East or the Pentagon s military
 playland in Afghanistan Instead the Chinese are continuing with their project of slowly
 developing a trade based infrastructure network that moves
 westward towards the Caspian and Mediterranean shores of the
 Middle East Foreign Policy, the magazine founded by Samuel Clash of
 Civilizations Huntington, was even given a taste of what is the
 obvious in China by the Stimson Center s East Asia fellow Yun Sun
 in 2013: As America pivots east, China marches in the other
 direction, she explained to readers The US has not stopped skimming to halt the Chinese in their
 tracks The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is yet another US
 scheme to do this The aim of the TPP is to isolate the Chinese
 by imposing trade restrictions between Beijing and the rest of
 the Asia Pacific region Beijing, however, has other plans China is going ahead with its projects, because it is not
 susceptible to Washington s ongoing pressure and destabilization
 operations The shadow that the American Eagle has been casting from the sky
 over Eurasia is waning and shrinking as it steadily declines The Silk Road is being rebuilt in Eurasia by the Chinese Dragon
 and its friends It is Marco Polo in reverse The Dragon and its friends, including the Russian Bear and the
 Iranian Lion, have different ideas about the management of their
 part of the world Management in Eurasia they have declared will
 be local and not American This is the basis for the blooming of
 an alphabetical hodgepodge of different regional organizations
 ranging from the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the
 Eurasian Union to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) This is merely the tip of the iceberg The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
 (SWIFT), which cut Iran off from the international banking system
 in 2012 under Uncle Sam s orders, reported at the end of 2013
 that China s national currency supplanted the European Union s
 euro as the second most widely used global currency after the US
 dollar 8 66 percent of global trade was taking place in the
 Chinese yuan This is just the beginning The use of the yuan will increase in
 international transactions Despite US attempts to curb Beijing globally, Chinese influence
 in Africa and Latin America is increasing too The US divided Sudan, attacked the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and
 created US Africa Command (AFRICOM), while their French poodles
 begun to re impose themselves militarily across Africa under
 Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of the attempt to drive the Chinese out
 of Africa The results, however, have done little and Chinese
 influence has continued to grow in Africa Across Latin America there is talk about increasing trade with
 China The Chinese are preparing to start building a mega canal
 in Nicaragua to meet the increased demands for trade from Latin
 America too At the same time, the Bolivarian Alliance for the
 Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and the Community of Latin American
 and Caribbean States (CELAC) are also reorienting Latin America
 away from the US towards China and its Eurasian partners The Chinese presence is additionally felt in both the North Pole
 and South Pole Beijing is eagerly waiting for the opening of an
 Arctic Silk Road or sorts and for exploration projects in
 Antarctica Beijing, in addition, a permanent observer at the Arctic Council
 and China has invested heavily in the research, Arctic
 development projects, and exploration of the countries bordering
 the North Pole Beijing s ultimate aim is to develop an Arctic
 transport network and access Arctic energy reserves The Pentagon sees China as the biggest threat to the United
 States The threat, however, is not one of a military nature; it
 is economic Chinese soft power is outflanking US hard power Unlike
 Washington and its Western European friends, Chinese capitalism
 is not sustained by military force While Washington continues to
 wage war and siphon the wealth of vanquished nations, the Chinese
 just continue to do business across the world as they steadily
 continue their westward march in Eurasia towards the banks of the
 Caspian and Mediterranean In other words, China works while

"24 Feb, 2014",American fits over Putin,"I have for a long time wanted to write about how the Western media, and especially the American media, portrays events happening in Russia and Russian foreign policy to Americans and American expert circles who do not read Russian and unfortunately, there are many Americans considered experts
 on Russia who neither read nor speak Russian Now, as the Sochi Olympics turned the Western media s attention
 to Russian affairs one more time, the unlimited bias displayed in
 the US media has forced me to speak out on this topic again It is plainly obvious that the Western and especially the
 American mass media never aspired to give objective coverage to
 events unfolding in Russia after the fall of the USSR, and what s
 more, never aspired to give an unbiased account of the motives of
 Russia s domestic and foreign policy There is therefore little
 surprise that they did not change their strategy for the
 Olympics It is no coincidence that both before and after the
 openings of the games, the main themes one could read in the US
 media were not sports events or athletes, but rather the
 impending horror of potential terrorist attacks on both Sochi and
 all of Russia; looming criminal persecutions of Russian LGBT
 citizens, as well as of tourists and foreign LGBT athletes; the
 overblown disorganization of the Russian government in
 constructing the infrastructure for the Games; the endless talk
 of monstrous corruption and wastefulness of billions of dollars
 in the construction process; illusory Russian threats to its
 neighbors born in the minds of Western media and experts ; and
 the alleged anti Western dÃ©marches of Russia s diplomats The media stoked unprecedented hysteria to remind Western
 audiences that the Sochi Olympics were scheduled to take place in
 a country akin to fascist Germany during the 1936 Olympics held
 in Berlin De facto, the Western media prepared the crowds all
 over the world for the total failure of the Olympics, which was
 to personify the failure of Putin himself and of Russia Western
 journalists brought this task as baggage with them to the
 Olympics Now, however, we can state unequivocally that the only
 losers this entire process produced were the Western journalists
 themselves, together with the so called experts  on Russia, who
 never stopped forecasting all sorts of apocalyptic events for the
 Sochi Olympics Sadly, even without the Olympics, Russians and citizens of many
 other countries have tended to distrust Western media in the past
 few years But the coverage of the Olympics, their preparation,
 opening, and conduct, convinced even the most naÃ¯ve of audiences
 and those vehemently anti government in Russia that the Western
 media hardly deserved any trust For a very long time as they
 demonized Putin s image, the media were not ready to admit that
 he and his country could create something grandiose; something
 magnificent; something to captivate Russians and foreigners
 alike In their desperate eagerness to deprive Putin of his
 triumph, they tried to paint dark everything about today s
 Russia Russian society responded as expected Russians did not see the
 media attacks as attacks on Putin, but rather as assails on their
 country on the part of the Western media, which tried to
 humiliate and deprive them, their society, and their country of
 dignity, and to cast doubt on the abilities of the Russian people
 and state to tackle problems nowadays easily tackled by weaker
 countries After all, the Olympics have been held in all sorts of
 places We need only remember the games in Sarajevo We can have no doubt that, with their anti Russian, anti Putin,
 and anti Olympic campaign, the Western media actually helped
 Putin s triumph, Russia s triumph, and the success of the Sochi
 Olympics, as the Russian people at large began to see the
 American media and American propaganda as the equivalent of the
 Soviet propaganda of the time of Suslov Agitprop (the head of
 Communist Party ideology under Brezhnev), which used to portray
 America as a caricature of itself a place of lynching of
 Blacks, of mass unemployment, of homelessness and hunger, which
 was about to collapse any day under the weight of its unsolved
 social and economic problems and bring victory to the people
 united under Marxist Leninist slogans and led by the US Communist
 Party Unfortunately, the process has come full circle Russian
 society in its attitude towards US media has turned from utter
 adoration and unquestioned trust to complete mistrust and
 rejection Even some Western journalists at the Olympics began writing that
 average Russians have started to feel insulted upon learning how
 Russia and the Sochi games were portrayed and what the Western
 commentary was on what happened in the country And what has in fact happened in the country is that it has
 mostly recovered its lost positions economically and politically
 on the international stage, and become one of the chief actors in
 world politics Since the mid 2000s, the Russian leadership,
 elite, and society have largely overcome the inferiority complex
 of the 1990s, become more confident and self sufficient, and
 turned their concern from who loved or hated their country to who
 understood them and their policy Today, Putin could easily repeat the words that Reagan said at
 the pinnacle of the Iranian crisis when he ran for president 
 Reagan said that he didn t care who loved or hated America, but
 he would make them respect it However, unfortunately, there
 isn t even an elementary understanding among the Western media
 and alleged experts in the coverage of both Russia s political
 regime and of the domestic and foreign policy followed by the
 Putin administration And without the understanding of what is
 happening in one of the key global players without whose
 constructive participation it is impossible to solve even one
 international problem or conflict, it is also futile to expect
 any sort of good policy towards this country The myriad
 misunderstandings in US Russian relations are not coincidental The most surprising fact about the coverage of Vladimir Putin s
 activity is not that it is vehemently negatively perceived among
 American neocons and liberal interventionists who expect the
 leadership of any country on the planet to bow to America s
 dictates Ideologists and strategists in these political circles
 hold the political regimes at any spot on the globe to standards
 set by Washington Thus any smidgen of independence on the part
 of foreign regimes is perceived to be an act hostile to democracy
 and progress, a violation of international norms among the
 civilized world that are set by this very same clique, while the
 leaders of those other countries daring to oppose Washington are
 painted as ignorant of the true interests and aims of their own
 people, known of course only to the neocons and interventionists
 in Washington It is furthermore surprising to find in the ranks of Putin s
 critics such famous conservative commentators who, in their
 criticisms of Putin s political course, abandon central
 conservative tenets, which can be ascribed either to ignorance of
 the pillars of conservatism or to complete lack of understanding
 of what is happening in Russia and what Putin s policies are
 about We need only cite here the reaction of a number of
 conservative figures to the recently published article inThe
 Nationby Stephen Cohen of NYU, who, Bill O Reilly,
 apparently due to his senile memory, still cited as a professor
 at Princeton Stephen Cohen in his article only wrote the obvious, namely that
 US mass media gives a hugely biased report of Russian events,
 which in itself is a horrible slide in the standards of American
 journalism, once highly respected because it represented various
 points of view on all issues of the day and aspired to provide
 objective information and carefully balanced political analysis What was only obvious to any specialist provoked a storm among
 the so called journalists and analysts who began to protest
 vehemently, claiming that they regularly took just and balanced
 positions on all issues both inside and outside American borders 
 The famous anchorman O Reilly, making his negative opinion known,
 criticized not the content of Cohen s piece, but the fact that it
 was published in the left leaningNation This provoked
 another analyst, Charles Krauthammer, who, just like O Reilly,
 has only a very foggy knowledge of what is happening in modern
 Russia, to state authoritatively that the authors and very agenda
 of the journal are endless apologists first to the Soviet Union,
 and now to Russia Further on, he emphasized that if we can
 understand why in the past, leftists would feel compelled to
 defend and apologize to the Soviet Union, as it represented an
 alternative to Western capitalism, it is mind boggling why
 leftists would defend Putin, especially considering they think he
 believes in nothing, created a personalistic regime, and governs
 a dictatorship Krauthammer s comments were awfully primitive,
 full of all the bromides found in Western media, spiced with
 stereotypes from the arsenal of Russian radical liberals that
 reside on the margins of the political spectrum Stephen Cohen traditionally criticizes American policy towards
 Russia under the presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama His
 criticisms are very similar to those of famous conservative Pat
 Buchanan who also believes that a series of unilateral actions by
 US administrations failing to account for Russian interests have
 created and continue to create tension between the two countries,
 and that the Russian side was neither the initiator nor the
 reason for all the numerous conflicts in relations, and that the
 responsibility for them lies with the American administrations 
 The question isn t whether Cohen is on the left and Buchanan on
 the right The question is, how objective are they in their
 analyses? One can have any opinion of Stephen Cohen, and I myself disagree
 with him on many issues, such as his evaluation of Gorbachev s
 role, but no one can argue that Stephen Cohen is a great scholar
 and a brilliant expert on Russian and Soviet history, and that
 when he writes on Russia, despite having his own ideological and
 political preferences, he attempts to be objective in his
 analysis and understanding of the processes in both the USSR and
 now Russia In the same way, the conservative positions of
 Buchanan do not cloud his objectivity because, at the end of the
 day, American readers do not need analysts to proclaim their love
 or loathing of the object of analysis, but first and foremost
 they need understanding of what is happening in Russia and what
 aims and interests the US should pursue in dealing with this very
 important country To demonstrate, we must say that Charles Krauthammer has not the
 vaguest understanding of Russian realities and simply parrots all
 the nonsense, stereotypes, and clichÃ©s in constant circulation in
 various media multiplied by the efforts of Russian marginal
 politicians and journalists of far left convictions It is
 baffling that it is American conservatives who repeat all this,
 and even more baffling that Krauthammer thinks that if Putin
 isn t a staunch communist considering the collapse of the USSR,
 then he lacks all convictions This all comes at the backdrop of what is obvious to many, even
 some American researchers, among whom the above mentioned
 Buchanan, namely, that if there is one politician in the world
 who isn t afraid to express his respect for religion, tradition,
 and traditional and family values, who openly calls for the
 protection of traditional European mores and speaks against
 non traditional values gaining ground unchallenged by the ilk of
 politically correct European and American politicians, this is
 Putin Many years ago, I read with pleasure the book 'Statecraft as
 Soulcraft' by well known American intellectual George F Will, in
 which he identified himself as a conservative in the Burkian
 tradition According to many of his publicly stated convictions,
 Putin is such a Burkian conservative as well I recall reading
 that Krauthammer is a friend of Will s If O Reilly and
 Krauthammer have failed to read Burke, they know who to ask to
 define Burkian conservatism for them Without going into detail
 of the immortal ideas outlined in Burke s Reflections on the
 Revolution In France,  I will only say that Putin takes great
 care of the state and protects it from its weaknesses, just as
 Burke advises a leader should do treat the state s frailties as
 a weakness in one s own father Vladimir Putin also understands
 that society and the state are living organisms, not mechanisms
 that one can adjust to fit abstract molds dreamed up by dreamers,
 which is why he is cautious of social and political reform Putin cannot afford to forget that, in the past century,
 half baked reforms twice led to state collapse in Russia and
 claimed countless victims and losses This politician, instead of
 being offered support in conservative circles, is instead
 constantly subjected to unjustified critique Such pathetic types
 as O Reilly and his colleague Dennis Miller of Fox News at times
 even try to mock Putin and Putin s Russia, knowing not even what
 they are talking about or what sort of country Putin is leading;
 they have as limited knowledge of modern Russia as does Senator
 McCain, who still believes the paperPravdais the main
 print outlet of the Russian government It is not an accident that Krauthammer still believes Putin has
 abolished gubernatorial elections at the same time as dozens of
 new governors are being elected as per new laws in various
 regions of the Federation In addition, the likes of O Reilly and
 Krauthammer have zero understanding of what is happening in
 Ukraine or what Russia s policy there is, but all the same
 attempt to explain everything that takes place in Kiev as
 Russia s misdeeds or to paint the legitimately elected Ukrainian
 government as Putin s puppet They also consider it perfectly
 normal to pursue a coup to depose of a legitimate president, just
 as Washington looked the other way when in Egypt the military
 deposed the legally elected President Morsi, and when, with
 Obama s and the Pentagon s blessing, that same military got rid
 of American long term ally and friend Mubarak We get the impression that conservative circles in America are
 undergoing a major crisis They simply lack understanding of what
 they support and oppose At the very least, this is what is
 happening with them with regard to Putin and modern Russia They
 are obviously still living in the Cold War era and cannot escape
 the stereotypes and clichÃ©s around which they comfortably built
 their worldviews, and through which they saw the Soviet Union,
 and now Russia Lacking adequate expertise on the subject, being
 ignorant of the language, and having no alternative sources of
 information, they simply recycle the entire media waste and
 garbage exported in large amounts by Russian radicals and
 circulated in the media ad nauseam There are several reasons for this First, it is hard for those politicians and commentators to get
 used to the thought that after the victory in the Cold War and
 the de facto liquidation of Russia in the 1990s, Russia all of a
 sudden became an important factor in world politics, while a new
 Russian leader strong, confident, and charismatic is
 demanding the deserved spot for his country on the world stage as
 well as respect for it in international circles, actively acting
 and, as a rule, being right in his actions This was so when he
 proclaimed his opposition, in unison with the Germans and the
 French, to the US adventures in Iraq Today it is no secret for anyone that Libya too was a grave
 mistake perpetrated by the American administration, while the
 Russian leader warned that aggression against Gaddafi was not
 based on any democratic awakening in the country, and that it
 would lead to the collapse of the state, which eventually
 happened Putin staunchly held his position against arbitrary
 regime change around the world when nobody knew what regimes
 would sprout to take the place of the old ones, and he still
 maintains this position with regard to Syria Second, the actions of the Russian leadership sit badly with a
 substantial part of the Washington establishment midwifed in the
 1990s and nurtured on ideas of American unilateral global
 domination This part of the establishment finds it hard to
 accept that someone might stand in the way of such domination Third, this same part of the establishment also finds it
 unpalatable to agree with the famous assertion of Lord Acton that
 power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 They cannot see that the saying holds true not just inside a
 country, but also internationally This is why frequently, when
 Russia goes against the US on the international arena, it does so
 not out of spite, but in the goodwill pursuit to prevent grave
 mistakes by their partners, of which the past 20 years abound As
 my friend Dimitri Simes puts it very succinctly, the US has
 acquired a democracy promotion complex  that is as
 noxious and dangerous for American foreign policy as the military
 industrial complex, of which Eisenhower famously warned New
 realities need new approaches, which in turn need paradigmatic
 changes in the worldviews in America and the world; something
 that not everyone in Washington is prepared to make, be it in
 analytical, political, or journalistic circles The absence of
 such a paradigmatic change is a serious obstacle to objective and
 sober evaluations of what is happening in the world, and
 especially in Russia In addition, I think there is another psychological factor that I
 would like to discuss, especially in view of the fact that often,
 when O Reilly turns to Krauthammer for comments, he does so
 invoking Krauthammer s psychology background Krauthammer, for
 all his education, rarely has any idea of the psychology of other
 people that dictates their actions, but nonetheless I can make
 some inferences about his own psychology, as well as that of
 O Reilly, Senator McCain, Dennis Miller, and a number of others
 who, at the very mention of Putin s name, erupt in hysteria I
 will take the risk to suggest that this is provoked in no small
 part by their own psychological troubles It looks to me as if they subconsciously adore Putin,
 understanding that he personifies the type of leader which they
 desire for their own country, and who reminds them of Ronald
 Reagan who America considers to be the personification of the
 ideal leader, is admired among Republicans and Democrats alike,
 and considered to be one of America s strongest presidents after
 World War II Putin is the same type of great communicator  that
 Reagan was; the type who connects directly with the people and
 easily explains complex issues of domestic and foreign policy 
 This is what accounts for his perpetually high rating and the
 high level of trust that the electorate has in him It is no
 accident that Putin is respected by people who have worked with
 Nixon and Reagan We can enumerate among them Kissinger,
 Buchanan, and Rohrabacher Vladimir Putin is charismatic, strong, autonomous, confident,
 decisive, and effective, and has demonstrated all of these
 qualities with his actions, not his words These qualities he has
 showcased in domestic and especially in foreign policy He
 exhibited them in his opposition to the Iraq and Libya
 interventions He rescued President Obama from a similar fiasco
 in Syria Putin further stated his attitude towards the Arab
 Spring, and has been constructive in his handling of the problem
 with the Iranian nuclear program We can continue the list ad
 infinitum Thus, venerating Putin and desiring the selfsame
 leader for America, these people are threatened by the very
 thought that they are obsessed with him, and try their hardest to
 remove any suspicion of harboring such feelings; and the more
 they think about it, the harder they try to rid themselves of the
 idea, resorting to spewing all sorts of dirt and villainy in the
 public discourse so no one would accuse them of admiring this
 politician This is a form of sadomasochism, a love hate situation from which
 they cannot escape I cannot otherwise explain the phenomenon of
 them constantly vilifying and attacking the person who is
 ideologically closest to them Without trying to understand their
 subconscious, there is no way to make sense of their behavior
 towards Putin At the end of the 1990s, William Safire in hisNew York
 Timescolumn turned to Madeleine Albright and Evgeny
 Primakov and said, Do not be ashamed to say that you are
 Jews  I would like to turn to O Reilly, Krauthammer,
 Senator McCain, Dennis Miller, and others who try to conceal
 their fondness for Putin with their foul attacks I would like to
 appeal to them paraphrasing Safire: Gentlemen, do not be
 afraid to say that you love Putin, that you dream of such a
 leader for the US  I am confident that this will remove the
 heavy psychological split in which you exist It will ease your
 neurosis and you will cease to poison the atmosphere of
 Russian American relations Andranik Migranyan

"30 Jan, 2014","US, EU meddling in Ukraine battle","In the heat of recent exchanges and deaths of protesters in Ukraine, many have lost sight of the insidious role key players in Washington and certain EU countries are playing William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com Their agenda seems to be to force an immediate end to the elected
 Yanukovich government in Kiev and lock Ukraine into the EU and,
 ultimately, NATO Washington s agenda has little to do with democracy and freedom , and a lot to do with
 destabilizing Putin s Russia On Sunday, January 19, the eight week long series of protests and
 demonstrations against the government of President Viktor
 Yanukovich in Kiev escalated to a new level of violence Bands of
 right wing militants called Pravy Sektor (Right Sector), attacked
 Ukrainian police guarding government buildings and attempting to
 contain the protesters Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at riot police from the top
 of the Dynamo Kiev football stadium in central Kiev beginning
 January 19 Police responded by using stun grenades and tear gas
 against the mobs Vehicles were torched by the hooligans from the
 neo Nazi Pravy Sektor More than 60 police were hospitalized from
 barrages of rocks, stones and Molotov cocktails The core of Pravy sektor is made of the activists of radical
 groups, including Trizub , Patriot of Ukraine ,as
 well as UNA UNSO and the Svoboda (Freedom) ultra right
 party, which won nearly 10 percent of votes at the last
 parliamentary election in Ukraine They are pro EU The far right violent radicals told Radio Free Europe, a US
 Government media agency tied to the CIA and State Department,
 that they were preparing full bloody guerrilla war against the
 government Andrey Tarasenko, Pravy Sektor s coordinator warned, If they attack and try to carry out a bloody crackdown, I
 think there will be a massacre Guerrilla warfare will begin in
 Ukraine Tarasenko stated that their demands are to oust the
 current government and build a nation state in
 Ukraine What kind of nation state we must imagine They also
 demand that Yanukovich step down, but, generously enough, add
 that they would give him and his family 24 hours to leave
 the country safely  On their VKontakte (In Contact) social network website, the
 organization calls for donations of items such as slingshots,
 steel balls, gasoline, laser pointers, glass bottles, chains, and
 pyrotechnics Their published manifesto is nothing short of bizarre: All
 those who at this point would try to tame the revolutionary
 energy of the masses should be proclaimed traitors and punished
 in the most severe way The time of peaceful singing and dancing
 at Maidan [Independence Square] is over This is a waste of time 
 There can be no negotiations, no compromise with the ruling gang 
 We will carry high the fire of national revolution  Curious is the fact that in the beginning of the protests, Pravy
 Sektor members were calling themselves the Maidan
 self defense force They had been designated by the main
 opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk and Oleg
 Tyagnibok to provide security for peaceful protesters Now they
 clearly have split from the peaceful protests Even more bizarre is the fact that in recent days ambassadors of
 several EU member states, as well as the US and Canada have gone
 to Maidan to meet Pravy Sektor activists and learn how the
 headquarters of national resistance operates Instead of unequivocally condemning the rise of violent Ukrainian
 nationalism, which could turn Ukraine into another Yugoslavia or
 Libya, the West is only threatening President Yanukovich with
 sanctions, while turning a blind eye to the real Pravy Sektor
 danger The Tarasenko demands are virtually the same as ex boxer turned
 right wing politician, Vitaly Klitschko, the pro EU apparent
 favorite of Germany s Merkel government Klitschko has lived in
 Germany for the past several years The nominal reason for the latest explosive protests in Ukraine
 was passage of a series of emergency laws to control the civil
 disorder by the Parliament on January 16 which, among other
 things, restrict the right to protest, constrain independent
 media, and inhibit the operation of NGOs Evidence suggests that key players in the Ukraine protest
 movement are being steered and orchestrated by Washington funded
 NGO s like the National Endowment for Democracy, the German
 Marshall Fund in The United States (a Washington think tank
 financed by a donation from the German Parliament), and certain
 key neo conservative Bush Cheney leftovers in senior positions at
 the State Department Already on October 11, 2011, the German Marshall Fund hosted
 Vitaly Klitschko, then WBC Heavyweight Boxing Champion just
 entering Ukraine s political boxing ring, at a Washington meeting
 to discuss Ukraine s European perspective Again in 2012 during the October Ukraine elections The German
 Marshall Fund in the United States hosted a top level group of
 UK, French and German journalists to visit Ukraine, where they
 also met Klitschko The Marshall Fund journalists were told by
 the US Embassy officials in Kiev that, Ukrainian oligarchs
 would like to see a strong opposition to the Party of Regions in
 the new parliament in order to temper the enrichment of President
 Yanukovich s family  That strong opposition is today headed by three very
 different political parties One which won a shocking 10 percent
 in the last elections and sits in parliament is Svoboda, a
 neo fascist nationalist party led by Oleg Tyagnibok Tyagnibok
 backed the US financed 2004 Orange Revolution He is openly
 anti Semitic and anti Russian, once claiming that Ukraine was
 ruled by a Moscow Jewish mafia The second largest
 opposition party, jailed opposition figure, Yulia Tymoshenko s Fatherland , led by Arseny Yatsenyuk, has signed an
 agreement to work with the neo fascist Svoboda The opposition figure most attractive to the West is ex boxer
 Klitschko, head of UDAR (strike), the smallest opposition party,
 who has spent the last years living in Germany In order to have
 a chance at a Parliamentary majority in 2015, Klitschko will be
 forced to make a coalition with Svoboda and its policies, even
 though he is trying a delicate tightrope act of claiming to
 distance from Svoboda s anti Semitic ultra nationalism In an Op Ed in the London Financial Times, Klitschko wrote, the official halt in Ukraine s European integration unmasks
 the true face of the Yanukovich regime  a cartel of
 commercial self interests that has captured public office and
 believes that political longevity can be bought by selling
 Ukraine s interests Ukrainians, he warned, would not allow
 Yanukovich and his cronies to steal their future and
 if their views were not taken into account, more protests
 are yet to come  A central role in encouraging the Ukraine protesters is being
 played by the US State Department, and especially Victoria
 Nulland A review of the official statements from Nulland, who met
 personally with opposition leader Klitschko in early December, is
 instructive of the open interference of Washington in the
 internal affairs of Ukraine Nulland a Hillary Clinton
 appointee who now is assistant secretary of the Bureau of
 European and Eurasian Affairs in the State Department did not
 respect a sovereign decision by Ukraine s government in November
 2013 not to accept the dismal terms offered by Brussels for a
 Ukrainian EU Association status The EU offer would have forced Ukraine to open its
 economy to free market rules in return for little 
 When Yanukovich told the EU of his government s decision in
 November, Nulland s spokesperson issued the following statement: We continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian
 people to achieve a prosperous European democracy European
 integration is the surest course to economic growth and
 strengthening Ukraine s democracy That was an undiplomatic
 intervention on the side of the protesters designed to embolden
 the opposition It did indeed Then on December 5 in Kiev, after her meeting with Vitaly
 Klitschko, Nulland declared, There should be no doubt about
 where the United States stands on this We stand with the people
 of Ukraine who see their future in Europe ¦  She followed her speech with a high profile bizarre media
 photo op where she carried a single plastic bag of food to give
 to the opposition demonstrators Nulland s partisan pro EU
 comments were followed by a brazen appearance from Republican
 war hawk Senator John McCain a few days later, siding with the
 opposition in December McCain is chairman of the Board of
 National Endowment for Democracy s International Republican
 Institute, which has been in the middle of all US Color
 Revolution destabilizations since 2000 Most recently, on January 15, after attacking Russia for granting
 a vital $15 billion bond purchase to help stabilize Ukraine,
 Nulland all but outlined the standard US government template for
 election tampering that has been done in countless color
 revolutions since the NED s 2000 coup against Yugoslavia s
 Milosevic She told the US Senate, the use of violence and acts of
 repression carried out by government security forces and their
 surrogates have compelled us to make clear publicly and privately
 to the government of Ukraine that we will consider a broad range
 of tools at our disposal if those in positions of authority in
 Ukraine employ or encourage violence against their own
 citizens  Nulland then issued a direct order to President Yanukovich: We call on him to make it credible through concrete actions
 to restore government accountability, rule of law and engagement
 with Europe and the IMF Then, referencing planned 2015
 national Ukraine elections, she added, US pre election
 assistance to Ukraine likely will include programs to support
 citizen oversight of the campaign environment and the conduct of
 the elections, independent media coverage and informed civic
 awareness and participation And finally, The State
 Department and USAID are reviewing how best to support Ukrainian
 civil society and media  USAID is widely cited as a cover for CIA operations in foreign
 countries Victoria Nulland herself is a former assistant to Vice President
 Dick Cheney, and married to neo conservative guru, Robert Kagan 
 She was under fire when caught recently lying to the American
 people when she was Hillary Clinton s State Department
 spokesperson Nulland pushed her superiors then to completely
 delete numerous references of extremists linked to Al Qaeda in
 Benghazi and eastern Libya after the assassination of the US
 Ambassador She also persuaded more senior officials to delete
 information on at least five other attacks against foreign
 interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants Washington is clearly out to destabilize the new Ukraine Russia
 economic cooperation by hook or crook On January 22, after
 severe Pravy Sektor violence, the American Embassy in Kiev
 announced it was revoking the visas of several unnamed Ukraine
 Government officials responsible for actions taken against
 protesters in November and December The latest negotiations between the Yanukovich government and the
 three main opposition party leaders Klitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk
 and Oleg Tyagnibok have led to the resignation of Yanukovich s
 Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov and his cabinet, and changes in the
 emergency laws proposed 10 days earlier Nine out of 12
 anti protest laws passed January 16 were repealed At this point, whatever agenda Victoria Nulland s State
 Department may have had in trying to woo Ukraine away from
 Moscow, the internal forces of instability, egged on by vocal
 support from the West, have made the outcome incalculable That
 is certainly not in the true interest of the EU, having a
 critical Central European nation of 45 million ungovernable, and
 a rising nationalist fascist Svoboda led party calling the shots 
 That would prove too much even for the legendary boxing talent of
 Klitschko The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-eu-interference-in-ukraine-402/

 acknowledged in his lifetime as the embodiment of magnanimity and
 reconciliation as Nelson Mandela was He set aside the bitterness of enduring 27 years in apartheid
 prisons and the weight of centuries of colonial division,
 subjugation and repression to personify the spirit and practice
 of ubuntu He perfectly understood that people are dependent on
 other people in order for individuals and society to
 prosper That was his dream for South Africa, and the hope that he
 represented the world over If it was possible in South Africa,
 it was possible in Ireland, it was possible in Bosnia and Rwanda,
 it was possible in Colombia, it is possible in Israel and
 Palestine Of course, in the spirit of ubuntu, Madiba was quick to point
 out that he alone could not take credit for the many accolades
 that came his way; that he was surrounded by people of integrity
 who were brighter and more youthful than himself That is only partially true The truth is that the 27 years Madiba spent in the belly of
 the apartheid beast deepened his compassion and capacity to
 empathize with others On top of the lessons about leadership and
 culture to which he was exposed growing up, and his developing a
 voice for young people in anti apartheid politics, prison seemed
 to add an understanding of the human condition Like a most precious diamond honed deep beneath the surface
 of the earth, the Madiba who emerged from prison in January 1990

"11 Oct, 2013",Assange: âSnowden safe but journalists dealing with him at riskâ (FULL VIDEO),"Edward Snowden is safe in Russia, but the fates of journalists who helped him and published his leaks are now of more concern for WikiLeaks, Julian Assange said in an exclusive interview with RT Spanish Behind the News host Eva Golinger Assange also shared his views on the NSA scandal in Latin America
 and the future of freedom of information He criticized the US and the White House for abusing its power
 more than any other administration in history, stressing that
 President Obama has prosecuted twice as many journalists under
 the espionage act as all previous US presidents combined since
 1917 Eva Gollinger:We re at the Ecuadorian embassy in
 London, and with us is the founder and publisher of WikiLeaks,
 Julian Assange Issues such as cyber warfare, espionage, surveillance, you have
 analyzed and written extensively about Your organization
 WikiLeaks has exposed the way the US and its allies use these
 mechanisms to advance their power in influencing the world and
 the recent documents and revelations made public by Snowden, a
 former National Security Agency analyst, have caused a furious
 reaction throughout Latin America Documents particularly
 pointing to mass surveillance and data collection of different
 Latin American nations, but especially Latin American leaders,
 heads of states in Brazil and Mexico, the Ecuador government, in
 Venezuela and strategic interests How have you viewed the
 revelations by Snowden and the impact they have had on Latin
 America and the reaction from these Latin American governments? Julian Assange:Ninety eight percent of Latin American
 telecommunications to the rest of the world that means SMS,
 phone, email etc passes through the US That s a function of
 the geography of the Americas, and as a result the US has what
 its intelligence agencies call a home field advantage , where
 they can easily intercept these communications that pass through
 them, index them, store aspects of them forever, and therefore
 gain understanding of how Latin America is behaving, where it is
 moving, its economic transfers, the activities of its leaders and
 major players That permits the US to predict in some ways the behavior of Latin
 American leaders and interests, and it also permits them to
 blackmail Nearly every significant person in Latin America is
 blackmailable by the US, because the US has access to those
 telecommunications records that have passed through the US, as
 well as other records it has obtained within LA by planting fiber
 optic taps, surveillance equipment at embassies and DA bases 
 Even one of those revealed in Ecuador as a result of Snowden`s
 leaks So you have a situation where the US has mapped out the entire
 community structure, the relations between every individual who
 has any chance of having any influence in Latin America And is
 able to shift and play off different parties against one another 
 If you say that it is true then why did Maduro win the Venezuelan
 presidential election? Why did president Correa win with a
 significant majority in the Ecuadorean elections, given the US
 attitude towards these two states? Well it`s not a function of the US not having enough intelligence
 data about Latin America, it s a function of the US taking its
 eye for a 10 year period off Latin America, and putting its eye
 on the Middle East and to a degree on to Asia as well And during
 that period a number of Latin American states have developed an
 increased independence from the US and its activities and now
 unfortunately the US is turning its interests back to Latin
 America But unlike 10 years ago, it has a worldwide mass
 surveillance apparatus to detect nearly every single person EG:The President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff recently in
 her speech before the UN General Assembly had very harsh strong
 words for the US mass espionage program, and particularly for
 President Barack Obama, who was there in her presence when she
 gave the speech, and she not only denounced and condemned that
 espionage as a violation of sovereignty, but she also called for
 the creation of an independent internet and communications
 platform within Latin American nations, or even internationally,
 that is not subject to US control Countries like Venezuela have developed fiber optic cables with
 the Caribbean, with Cuba exclusively having also launched
 communication satellites into space to ensure their own
 communication sovereignty Is this the solution to protecting
 them against this type of US invasion and violation through
 technological sovereignty? JA:Look, just like there is no meaningful sovereignty
 without control of freedom of movement, no meaningful sovereignty
 without economic sovereignty, there is no meaningful sovereignty
 without control of your own communications It s freedom of
 movement, freedom of communication, freedom of economic
 interaction that defines a state Now the US has been
 aggressively trying to interdict economic exchange through
 interception of control over Swift, Visa, MasterCard, payments
 going through Latin America via the Bank of America But it s
 also delving in to Latin American major computer systems, operate
 important segments of government and the media and Pertobras in
 Brazil and other major economic interests and interfering with
 the sovereignty of communications That s what it is about You know, when is a person or an organization is part of one
 state or another? Well, it s part of a state if that state can
 control its movements, its economic interchange or its
 telecommunications interchange, the US is grabbing hold of
 economic interaction and telecommunications interaction and so
 what is left is some degree of control of the physical force in a
 state Even that is being eroded When we look at what happened in the Edward Snowden case when the
 US sprayed out extradition requests, Neil McBride, the same
 national security prosecutor who is prosecuting me, behind that
 sprayed out extradition requests for Edward Snowden to Venezuela,
 to Bolivia, to Hong Kong, to Iceland, to Ireland That was about
 trying to take advantage of treaty arrangements which force the
 police and judicial systems of other countries to obey the
 interests of the US government So by subordinating regulatory or policing systems in treaty
 arrangements to another government, that third component the
 control of use of force is also given away In academic theory
 about what is happening there, we call this lawfare , which is
 using international treaty arrangements and multilateral
 organizations to get the territory or gains that you would
 normally get by war instead by law When you couple that activity
 to telecommunications interception and economic interception then
 in fact you control the state without invading it And that s
 what leaders and policymakers must be aware of in Latin America 
 That there s no effective sovereignty without sovereignty in the
 most important parts economic interaction, telecommunications
 and control of police and judicial instruments EG:But is it possible knowing also what you know of
 about the US capacity in terms of its technology and its massive
 reach through surveillance that in Latin America they can develop
 sovereign technology that would be free from US control, or is it
 merely a dream? JA:Well, this idea that Dilma proposed of perhaps setting
 up an international regulatory commission for the internet There
 are some that the US is terrified of: the ITU the international
 communications union taking over regulation of key aspects of
 the internet ITU is European dominated, has been for many years 
 I don t believe that the internet should be dominated by any one
 region and to a degree it shouldn t be dominated by governments 
 I mean, the great liberty of communications for individuals and
 trade for businesses has come about because of a lack of control
 by states See, some of the proposals by Dilma being put forward are not a
 mechanism to give Brazilians greater freedom from interception,
 rather they are a mechanism to give the Brazilian government
 equal access to that intercepted information So we must be quite
 careful There s a natural tendency by states, of course, to want
 to increase their own power And they are more concerned in
 increasing their domestic power really, than they are typically
 concerned by the United States increasing its power EG:I want to talk about Google Because you ve
 criticized Google extensively and also referred to it as an
 extension of US foreign policy and power These are strong
 statements to make about a service that is used around the world 
 And for example in many Latin American countries, even the
 highest levels of government, have Gmail accounts So can you
 elaborate a little bit on why you perceive Google as such a
 danger to our society and what are the alternatives? JA:I wrote about that this year in my book Cypherpunks 
 and some recent articles reviewing the chairman of Google s book
 The New Digital Age In that book it s very clear what is
 happening Google is presenting itself to Washington as a
 geopolitical visionary who can show the US the way forward in
 Latin America, in Asia, in Europe and so on And that s quite a
 reactionary piece of work With backcover praise chosen
 pre publication by Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Tony
 Blair, [Michael] Hayden, the former head of the National Security
 Agency, the NSA The primary acknowledgement is to Henry
 Kissinger So where s that coming from? That is coming from Google that
 started out in California as part of grad student culture in
 Stanford University, pretty nice, naÃ¯ve, wanting to build
 services that the world would use But as Google got big it got
 close to government As it tried to enter into foreign markets it
 became reliant on the State Department to the degree where the
 head of Google ideas is now immediately a former advisor of
 Hillary Clinton and Rice from the State Department This close nexus and interaction between Google and the State
 Department is something that we ve documented on WikiLeaks in
 releases and also in cables meetings between key State
 Department advisors and execs of Google It wasn t much of a
 surprise when we learnt that as far back as 2009 Google had
 paired up with the National Security Agency to enter into the
 PRISM program So we can see that Google is now part of Family America It
 spends more money now on lobbying in Washington than Lockheed
 Martin In the Google book it even states that what Lockheed
 Martin was to the 20th century, hi tech companies will be to the
 21st It s a really quite strong form of neo imperialism And I
 don t want to use that phrase as some sort of hackneyed Marxist
 expression, but that s what it s about jacking in the entire
 world into the US economic and informational system EG:Your organization WikiLeaks has published hundreds
 of thousands of documents, many of them from the US government,
 classified documents You ve come under heavy fire, the
 organization has come under attack And yet you continue to
 publish documents Is that going to go on, how is WikiLeaks
 functioning and are the attacks also continuing? JA:The attacks are continuing Let s go back to 2010 
 Pentagon gave a 40 minute public press conference During that
 press conference they made a demand to us, the organization, to
 me personally âYou must destroy everything that we had published
 in relation to the US government â Destroy everything we were
 going to publish And cease stealing with [the help of] US
 military whistleblowers or else we will be compelled to do so As
 a result we said no, we were not going to do so We re a
 publisher, we made a promise to our sources and the public to
 publish fearlessly and frankly The US government then engaged in a three year long war against
 WikiLeaks, which continues to this day It started up a whole
 government investigation, including over 12 different agencies
 including the CIA, publicly declaring the grand jury into
 WikiLeaks, that investigation the Department of Justice admits as
 recently as August 23 continues The position that we re in is that our important source of
 WikiLeaks, Private Manning, has been sentenced to 35 years A
 tactical victory, believe it or not, for his defense team,
 because the US was demanding life imprisonment without parole 
 And probably as a result of our intervention in the Edward
 Snowden matter, we know it for a fact that the sentiment in
 Washington against WikiLeaks as a result of the Edward Snowden
 matter is increasingly adverse But the organization continues to publish, continues to fight in
 courts where we ve intervened in multiple times In the Bradley
 Manning case we ve had a series of victorious court cases against
 the banking blockade Interestingly all court cases that
 WikiLeaks has been involved and that have come to a judgment, it
 has won There have been significant victories in the European
 Parliament where we ve managed to push forward legislation which
 outlaws this sort of banking blockade that is against us, the
 blockade that s similar to that blockade that s happening against
 Cuba Interestingly in relation to financial blockades and the freedom
 of economic interaction, that sovereign right for states to
 interact within states, to interact economically The internet
 has meant that economic interaction and communication are now
 merged together So when the US wants to intercept and surveil
 [sic] the economic interactions between people and companies, it
 just intercepts the internet and it gets both of these at the
 same time Similarly if it wants to block off economic
 interaction with some bank, say in Iran, well it can just block
 off telecommunications with that bank EG:You mentioned Private Manning's case And in that
 case, now known as Chelsea Manning, she was accused of espionage
 for passing documents to a media organization Classified
 documents But not to the so called traditional enemies So this
 treatment now of media organizations or journalists as an enemy 
 is that dangerous in terms of whistleblowers for one? But also
 the media outlets? And do you think that this forms part of what
 President Barak Obama referred to in his speech before the UN
 recently as the exceptionalism of the US This kind of
 persecution, treatment of media and whistleblowers as
 terrorists JA:Look, whenever you see a president talk about
 exceptionalism, what he's trying to say is the rules of civil
 behaviour doesn't apply to him Whether that's in invading
 another country or whether that s abuse of laws at home In
 relation to Barack Obama's use of the espionage act against
 alleged journalistic sources and journalists, that s something
 new So it s very important that people understand that this is
 not just a bit more of the same, it s a radical change Barack Obama has prosecuted more people under the espionage act,
 more journalistic sources under the espionage act than all
 previous presidents combined, going back to 1917 In fact he s
 prosecuted double the number So this is a deliberate conscious
 decision by the White House to create a chilling effect, using
 the espionage act as opposed to some other mechanism In the case
 of Bradley [now Chelsea] Manning there s no allegation, has never
 been an allegation that he has passed information on to another
 country, that he has sold information, that he was intending to
 harm the United States or its people in any manner whatsoever So
 that's just a linguistic abuse to call speaking to the media
 espionage Similarly it's a linguistic abuse to say that
 WikiLeaks as a publisher, when it publishes, is conducting
 espionage EG:I want to talk about your case a little bit We're
 here in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where you ve been for
 over a year, close to a year and a half And as of now there has
 been no resolution to the situation You've been given asylum by
 Ecuador, but you can't get to Ecuador because the British
 government would detain you if you set foot outside these doors 
 Recently the foreign minister of Ecuador, Ricardo Patino, has
 confirmed the fact that they have been working aggressively with
 the UK government trying to reach a solution They've been
 unsuccessful and now they're considering taking a case to a
 foreign international court: violation of sovereignty as well as
 the right to asylum amongst other rights that have been violated 
 How do you see the resolution to this situation? And is there
 one? JA:It's a political, diplomatic, legal mix I think in a
 reasonably short time frame year, year and a half actually,
 there are some good signs that there will be a resolution That
 time is on my side in this situation, because as times goes by,
 more of the facts of the situation are coming out We've been
 filing criminal cases in Sweden, in Germany, in relation to
 intelligence activity against the organisation there So I think
 the position of the some of the players involved is becoming
 aggressively more untenable as time goes by And we have seen
 even the Conservative Lord Mayor of London Boris Johnson denounce
 the expenditure of the police outside this embassy spying on me 
 He said that now this money amount to $10 million and should be
 spent on frontline policing, what police are meant to do, not
 ringing this embassy EG:And both you and Edward Snowden have received
 asylum in Latin American nations You in Ecuador and he's been
 offered asylum in Venezuela and Bolivia and also in Nicaragua He
 is in Russia with temporary asylum which your organization helped
 him obtain But how do you view the fact that it has been Latin
 American nations, traditionally known as less powerful and
 developing countries, that they had the courage to stand up to US
 power and support both of you JA:It's extremely interesting, isn't it? We were involved
 in filling out asylum requests for Edward Snowden formally and
 informally to around 20 different nations Some because we
 thought there was a decent chance, others because we wanted to
 show the public the refusal to generate some public debate and
 awareness about how the government is behaving But you're right,
 in terms of those nations that stepped forward, it was Latin
 America and Russia Not all of Latin America either, but
 Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador showing a keen interest What does
 that mean? These are not very powerful countries Russia we can understand,
 it has its own nuclear armaments, it s geographically fairly
 independent Whereas Latin America is not so That's really I
 think is an expression of Latin American democracy, where you
 have governments who feel the need to be responsible to their
 people, who feel the need to live up to the sort of values that
 they are preaching or they will held to account by the
 population And so I see that as a part of the democratic nature of
 Venezuela, Ecuador and perhaps now even Brazil, which hasn't yet
 made an offer, but it's starting to respond in relation to the
 surveillance matter, in protecting Glenn Greenwald it's
 starting to respond to the public pressure there EG:Also a shift in global power and the growing
 sentiment of sovereignty and independence in Latin America, but I
 want to ask about somethingâ¦ JA:You can compare in an interesting way, say
 Germany and Venezuela So in Germany privacy is a really big
 concern, it's probably of all the medium sized countries, privacy
 is the most in value in Germany, because of what happened in the
 WWII, and some other cultural aspects And in Germany we had
 Angela Merkel up for election So not only did these events about
 Edward Snowden's asylum and then spying occur in the context
 where a country is interested in privacy, but in the context of a
 country that had federal election And with reporters like Laura
 Poitras, based in Germany, working with Der Spiegel, publishing
 about German documents And yet the German government did not
 offer Snowden asylum, did not seek to transport him or assist him
 in any manner whatsoever So I think this is an example when even if the population has the
 democratic desire, population has the will, that the government
 doesn't properly reflect the will of the population Whereas we
 can see in Ecuador and Venezuela, that the government is more EG:Bolivia as wellâ¦ JA:â¦and Boliviaâ¦ that the government is more responsive 
 At least in relation to sovereignty issues, to the demands of the
 population EG:Unwilling to subordinate itself to US power I can
 only get in one last question I want to throw in a few
 things One is the issue if the future of journalism Is investigative
 journalism under extinction because of this treatment and
 prosecution of journalists who are exposing US abuses and those
 also other powerful entities around the world and are therefore
 being treated as terrorists or enemies? Snowden's possibilities
 in the future: what awaits him in terms of whistleblowers 
 treatment? Would he come under severe prosecution by the US? And
 also I want to tie into all of that a question about the film
 that's coming out Is it another attempt, the same thing in terms
 of trying to discredit and distort the work that you're doing,
 WikiLeaks is doing, Snowden is doing? Anyone, who's trying to
 expose those abuses? JA:Edward Snowden: he's now safe in Russia He has asylum
 for a one year period formally But assuming he doesn't run
 anyone over in a car, I imagine that the Russians will be happy
 to extent that indefinitely I m more concerned in terms of
 present people at risk, with our journalist Sarah Harrison, who
 was involved in getting Edward Snowden out of Hong Kong, spent 39
 days with him in the Moscow airport, protecting him filing asylum
 applications and is still in Russia Now, she's from the UK, as
 we know The Guardian newspaper was raided, Glenn Greenwald s
 partner detained for nine hours on account of terrorism charges
 here without charge A formal investigation, a formal terrorism
 investigation has started up in relation to all those
 people EG:Well the head of MI5 has also just declared that
 Edward Snowden, his documents have placed national security in
 dangerâ¦ JA:Yeah, I mean just absurd But also it's a position by
 the UK which is clearly that they're going after anyone who has
 had something to do with this matter, probably in order to show
 to the US that they feel their pain and that they are a part of
 the same club And possibly in relation to GCHQ So that's a
 concern for us, what will happen to Sarah Harrison? But I think
 if we look at the bigger picture, OK, yes, there s some
 development in the US and the UK, which is extremely serious 
 It's obvious to everyone The rule of law is gradually starting
 to collapse The mechanisms of government are lifting off from
 the population, from the judicial system The judicial processes
 are becoming more and more secret Here, introduction of a secret
 court Even the Labour Party here, Ed Miliband from the Labour Party
 pushing legislation saying that soldiers should not be able to be
 criticized, adding them to hate speech legislation This is a
 sort of proto fascism I mean, that's a strong thing to say, but
 I think that's a correct description And the US yes, that is
 making people extremely timid It has made The Guardian does
 good work here, but it has made the Guardian also very timid in
 its publications It's been holding a lot of stories back It's
 been extensively redacting, it has been holding documents back,
 same in the US From the point of view of WikiLeaks as a publisher, of course, we
 think that's great, that we we'll be the only player left in the
 field From the point of view of Julian Assange as a free speech
 activist, I think that's an abomination and extremely concerning 
 On the other hand, just because you can smell the gun powder in
 the air, you can smell the heat of the battle between those
 people, who are revealing information about the crimes of state,
 and war crimes and mass surveillance and so on And those who are
 trying to suppress it It doesn't tell you which side is winning There's a serious conflict going on between a growing national
 security system in the West and those people who are trying to
 expose what that system is doing That's for sure Which one of
 these two groups is winning is not clear We actually have some
 pretty important winds under our belt as well as saying many
 journalists are surveyed and prosecuted EG:The film? JA:OK, so the film, Fifth Estate or actually
 introduced alreadyâ¦ EG:Do you think it s an attempt to discredit you and your
 organization? JA:I don't sort of look at the things that way This film
 comes from Hollywood I know the book that it was based on The
 books were definitely an attempt to do precisely that DreamWorks
 has picked the two most discredited libellous books out of dozens
 of books available for it to pick But it's coming out of a
 particular milieu about within Hollywood and that constraints,
 it seems, what scripts can be written and what things would get
 distribution I don't know if that was the intent of the
 filmmakers It's certainly the result, but it's been doing quite
 poorly in the reviews I think the information we have published about it was pretty
 successful in knocking out any view that is inaccurate history 
 It's interesting to see that in the America's Disney, who's
 responsible for the distribution there, has been putting up
 posters of me with the word traitor emblazoned across my face 
 You know, a laughable concept cos because I'm an Australian, I
 couldn't even be a traitor, in theory, to the United States I
 mean it's a type of libel I think ultimately people are starting to become immune to those
 sorts of attacks There s been so many as time is going by And
 people who ve been watching the WikiLeaks saga have seen many of
 these attacks, having seen that they've turned out not to be
 true So I think our base is not going to be affected by the

 to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, specifically ignoring
 Obama s personal directive that Snowden should be handed over to
 the US With this measure, Putin echoes Russia s and the world s
 growing weariness with America s hegemonic carrot and stick
 strategy, and its double talk Both presidents had agreed to hold a summit in Moscow next month
 to discuss bilateral issues but, reading between the lines, one
 can clearly sense the increasing frustration the US and its key
 global allies feel towards Russia and China, the only two major
 powers that can stand up to them, bringing some measure of
 traditional balance of power to today s world; even if uneasy and
 fragile As with Julian Assange, the case involving Edward Snowden is
 well known around the world: both men were in a position to
 access credible behind the curtain information, together with the
 documentation backing it up, and they both came out boldly
 disclosing it to the public If the proof is in the pudding, then America s rage and ire, as
 well as that of its allies , are proof that these disclosures are
 in fact true, which is why such a large portion of global public
 opinion hail Snowden and Assange as true heroes and freedom
 fighters For when it comes to assessing the true motives and unconfessable
 activities and goals behind much of US, UK and Israeli foreign
 and domestic policies, millions of modern day Hamlets can smell
 that there is definitely something very rotten and not precisely
 in the State of Denmark If, as we believe, the supranational global power elites are
 embedded deep inside the public and private power structures of
 key nations notably the United States and the United
 Kingdom   then clearly their Achilles Heel is any and
 all disclosure of their crimes, their meddling in the internal
 affairs of other countries, their direct or indirect involvement
 in false flag attacks, their support of genocidal regimes when it
 serves their purpose, their murderous invasions and occupations
 in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Libya, and their obscene
 funding and support of terrorists, guerrillas and mafias in Syria
 and elsewhere, under the PsyOps cover of Arab
 Spring Now, if giving temporary asylum to a disgruntled 30 year old
 former National Security Agency (NSA) operative like Snowden has
 such impact on the US power structure so much so that it led
 the president of the United States to cancel a key summit with
 the President of Russia then one can only wonder at the fear
 and trembling they must feel when assessing potentially much more
 serious security breaches What if a really organized group of truly powerful
 insiders turned outsiders were to decide to confront Washington,
 New York, London and Tel Aviv with unquestionable evidence and
 proof of their crimes and their criminal perpetrators? What if,
 say, somebody comes up with total and undisputable proof on the
 truth behind 9/11? Or Iraq and Libya? Or Wall Street in 2008? Or
 London 7/7 ? Naturally global hegemons abhor anyone standing up to them, which
 is clearly what Russia has been doing for the past
 decade   At the UN, where Russia had been more
 accommodating to many US interests, after the US backed monstrous
 assassination of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on live TV and the
 rape of Libya in 2011, its appears Moscow got really fed
 up Assassinating global leaders to the chuckling of Hillary Clinton
 on CBS News is definitely not on Moscow s agenda A key change in Russian foreign policy can thus be clearly seen
 in the cases of Iran and, more significantly, in Syria a
 traditional Russian ally The US, UK and Israel know full well that even if they continue
 to finance the worst terrorists, mafias, murderers, arms dealers
 and Al Qaeda operatives whom they collectively dub as freedom fighters against the legitimate government of
 Bashar Assad, Russia just won t budge Putin s message is clear: the West will not have its way in
 Syria Period Many readers are probably asking, what about China? Isn t China
 supposed to be the key Pentagon target in the years to come
 because it continues to grow and grow, and its economy will soon
 surpass that of the US? Yes, but that s just the economy and, yes, China does hold almost
 $2 trillion in US Treasury Bills, which gives them the potential
 to wreak havoc on the US by just liquidating them short term in
 the major global financial markets China could, if it wanted,
 send the US Dollar crumbling down like the World Trade Center
 twin towers did in 2001 But the US knows China will not do that; not now, anyway, as they
 have much more to lose from a US financial collapse than they
 have to win   China knows that triggering the mass
 devaluation of those Treasuries would backfire and explode in
 their own face Besides, China has never had, nor has today, global hegemonic
 aims China seems quite happy to be and remain the undisputed
 power in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, something that
 is in sharp contrast with the US/UK/Israel, which together insist
 on running the whole world: politically, territorially,
 financially, even trying to impose its courts and laws In addition, China has few issues for open conflict: Tibet,
 Taiwan, a couple of disputed islands with Japan, perhaps, but
 that s basically it Their struggle lies on the economic and
 resources stage Now, compare that to the permanent conflicts the US and its
 allies stir up in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Central
 Europe etc China does not really need to be contained; it is self contained 
 The US and its allies, however, must be contained and, seeing the
 way things are going, in the long run they must be stopped Russia might have far less economic clout than the US, however
 the Kremlin has always had clear long term geopolitical
 objectives; intelligently designed and planned ever since the
 times of the tsars, later under the Bolsheviks, and today under
 its mature, coherent and consistent leadership For Russia not only has global aims, Russia understands the world
 and its multicultural complexities far better than the US On
 this, Russia is only rivaled by Britain and China So is the US now slipping back into Evil Empire ,
 Russia standing in the way of democracy ;
 Russia supporting the bad guys rhetoric? The truth is that Russia is helping to unmask American social and
 political decadence, financial weakness, and psychopathic
 imperial overdrive When Russia stands up to America, it shows strength, personality
 and self respect The world looks on and applauds On August 7, Obama appeared on Jay Leno s popular Tonight
 Show , whining and complaining about Putin, accusing Moscow
 of slipping back into Cold War mode  He listed US
 grievances against Russia: missile defense and arms control,
 trade relations, global security, human rights, civil society 
 and advising President Putin not to look at the past but to think about the future as there s no reason why we shouldn t
 be able to cooperate  Obama doesn t seem to understand that to think correctly about
 the future, requires learning from the experience of the past 
 Addressing the Snowden Affair in isolation is but another example
 of US double standards and double talk As journalist Glenn Greenwald of London s The Guardian newspaper
 reminded his readers on that same day, whilst Obama and the
 mainstream media today express so much distress over Snowden s
 Russian asylum, they seem to forget past cases where the tables
 were turned, and which did not involve a young, mild mannered
 whistleblower, but rather where the US protected the worst
 criminals and murderers For instance, the US refused to heed an extradition request from
 Italy for two CIA agents indicted in the alleged 2003 abduction
 of an Egyptian cleric in Milan (New York Times, February 28,
 2007); later, when CIA agent Robert Seldon Lady was released in
 Panama, he was flown back to the US to avert the possibility he
 might be extradited to Italy (Washington Post, July 19,
 2013) Then we have America s refusal to extradite former CIA supported
 Bolivian President Gonzalo SÃ¡nchez de Lozada who for all
 practical purposes was given US asylum so he could stand trial
 for genocide and war crimes in Bolivia (The Guardian, September
 9, 2012) Or the case of Luis Posada Carriles, whose extradition
 to Venezuela was also refused by the US, over his alleged role in
 the 1976 terror bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 people
 (El Paso Times, December 30, 2010) The list does not stop there In recent years, Argentina,
 Uruguay, Chile and Brazil filed repeated requests and legal
 summons asking the US to give up one Sir Henry A Kissinger,
 wanted for questioning over his decades long involvement with
 CIA backed military regime murders in those countries during the
 1970s, under a mass genocide strategy which later became known as Plan Condor But again, the Global Power Elite always stands behind its
 problem children like Sir Henry to the very end Spanish judge
 Baltasar GarzÃ³n went so far as to ask Interpol to arrest
 Kissinger for questioning during a visit to London but Alas! 
 to no avail And we won t even mention the repeated extradition requests filed
 by Belgian Courts against former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
 Sharon for his war crimes and crimes against humanity, filed by
 Lebanese victims of his 2001 killing sprees The list is far too long   But the double standards
 are glaringly obvious, which does not seem to unduly bother the
 Global Hegemons, for they are far too used to always having their
 way And even when they do take some risk they use their overpowering
 leverage to play their game safely, as if saying let s flip a
 coin: heads we win; tails you lose  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-russia-relations-tensions-280/
"19 Jul, 2013",'Obama can't afford a fair trial for Snowden' - Stephen Cohen,"Who s Edward Snowden more of a problem for now, Russia or the US? Has he sent US Russian relations into a tailspin or did he just reaffirm the sad state of affairs? Is the Russian Reset dead?Today we discuss the fallout from the Snowden case with Stephen Cohen, Professor of Russian Studies and History at New York University and Princeton University Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie
Shevardnadze: At this point, to whom is
Snowden more of a problem the US or Russia? Steven
Cohen:From my perspective, he is a
problem for both If we put this in historical context since the end
of the Soviet Union 22 years ago, we ve lost several opportunities
to create a meaning for cooperative relationships between Washington
and Moscow It appeared a few weeks ago that we had another
opportunity The opportunity began with a tragedy the bombings in
Boston It was later clear that there was a need for a lot of
cooperation in counter terrorism between Moscow and Washington And
then, the Syrian civil war, whatever it is, ran out of control 
it s certainly the worst crisis in the Middle East for many years 
It also appeared that Washington and Moscow were ready to do
something about it And then came Snowden Not only Snowden, but he
is clearly a setback I would say both for President Putin and
President Obama Sophie
Shevardnadze:But you say that Putin is
handling the Snowden situation wisely Steven
Cohen:What makes us really interested
is that President Putin is the man that likes to control the
environment in which he makes international and I suppose domestic
 decisions He couldn t control this Snowden came literally out
of the blue and he hadn t decided what to do So he was caught and
he remains caught between two strong countervailing factors: On the
one hand, Putin pursues in a world which I would call not an
ANTI American foreign policy, but an UN American foreign policy or a
NON American foreign policy That is, a foreign policy rather
different from the US in many areas Therefore, he could not turn in
Snowden a highly symbolic figure over to the US On the other
hand, it s absolutely clear that Putin wants some kind of
cooperative relationship with the US I think he has probably done as
good as he can do As in, the solution is to allow Snowden to remain
in Russia in some status of temporary asylum, while he sorts out how
he s going to go to a third country Venezuela or some other
place That s a legal issue He needs travel documents, and he
probably has to go to the embassy of that country in Moscow But
although it s legal, it s profoundly political In a way,
Russian American relationships hinge on that at the moment And as I
said the other day to an American who asked me, this tests the
leadership ability not only of Putin, but of Obama, to solve this
problem Sophie
Shevardnadze: You ve brought up an
interesting point saying that Putin likes to control the
situation Do you think he would have acted differently if he wasn t
confronted with the sheer fact of Snowden being in Russia? Steven
Cohen:I mean, all leaders real
leaders, state leaders try to control the environment in which they
make decisions Very often, they can t Wars come, acts of
terrorism come, and leaders change in other countries with which they
were doing business What we don t know about Snowden affair is
whether or not the Chinese, when they allowed Snowden to fly to
Moscow from Hong Kong, cleared it with the Russian end Whether the
Russians said, Okay, send him along  If that happened and we
don t know, but I would guess it did because the Chinese Russian
relationship is very important and very close at the moment I would
assume that whoever in Moscow made that decision it might not have
been President Putin; he can t make every decision before it
becomes a crisis they may have assumed that in fact Snowden was
going to do as Snowden was going to do spend maybe ten hours in
the transit section of Sheremetyevo airport and then get on a plane
to Havana, and onwards, as he thought, to Ecuador And then, a
problem rose with Ecuador and he is still in Moscow So in that
sense, we don t know if Putin said Ok, travel through Moscow, 
not knowing he was going to become a kind of resident in Moscow We
just don t know that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Another problem is that
his passport was cancelled so he couldn t really fly through Moscow
even if he wanted to But given the way things are right now, what
does Russia risk if it grants Snowden official refugee status? Steven
Cohen:As you know, there is a very
strong anti Kremlin, anti Putin, anti Russian lobby in Washington 
Its citadel is the US Congress That s why we get preposterous
legislation like the Magnitsky act Congress is prepared to do
anything to strike at Russia Yesterday, for example, one of the
senators proposed that the US boycott the Winter Olympics in Russia
in 2014 that won t happen but the mere fact that the US
senator, who is supposed to be a person of wisdom and dignity, would
propose such a preposterous thing shows you what kind of Congress we
are dealing with I predict and I think any idiot could predict 
that when, and I assume it s when  Snowden gets his temporary
asylum in Moscow, the members of Congress, members of the various
anti Russian lobbies like Freedom House in the US, and many others
will denounce the Kremlin and demand that Obama does something very
bad to Russia And then Obama will be tested we will see if he
can withstand that or not That s why I say by the way, that I
think it s is a kind of test not only of the wisdom and the
leadership of Putin but the wisdom and the leadership of Obama Let
me remind you, Obama didn t ask for this Snowden crisis Putin
didn t ask for it They just got it Sophie
Shevardnadze:The media right now is
more focused on Snowden s personal life what he eats, what he
wears, where he lives, where his girlfriend is than his
revelations and the leaks Can we expect the attention to turn back
to the NSA and PRISM, or is that issue now buried under the Snowden
narrative? Steven
Cohen:You raised what for me is the
fundamental question: What should we, the Americans, be doing now?
Ever since Snowden made these revelations, there s been a big open,
public debate about whether or not we approve of these massive,
intrusive surveillance programs by American intelligence agencies 
And of course, Europe and Russia and other countries who had been
survellied have to make that decision too But first and foremost,
this is the question for Americans: Is it compatible with our
concept of democracy? Of civil liberties? Of privacy? Or, on the
other hand, do we need these kinds of abuses of civil liberties to
protect ourselves against terrorism? There are two sides of this
issue It s a complicated issue Snowden wanted to trigger a debate
and he has failed, because as you say, the drama of the personal saga
of Edward Snowden what s going to happen to him, where he is
going to go, where his girlfriend is, he looked so young all
these personal dramas [have taken the spotlight] And I would guess
that Snowden, who seems to be a very serious and purposeful man, is
himself disappointed because his purpose, as he says, and I
believe him, in making these revelations is making a conversation in
the US about these surveillance practices, which, because of his own
drama, hasn t happened yet and it may never happen And Sophie,
let me add a matter that is absolutely never discussed in the US, but
it s profound: Obama says, the US government says, the Senators
say, the Media says, Showden should come home and stand trial 
Well, in some ways, if he could get a fair trial, if he could be out
on bail the way Daniel Elsberg was 30 years ago when he took the
Pentagon papes while he is preparing his trial, and he could tell a
story, and he could build a legal team, and he could have an
open court case with all the rights the defendants have, that means
that he could have all sorts of officials involved with this case,
right up to the vice president and the president of the US I cannot
imagine that the Obama administration or any US administration would
permit that, therefore I doubt very seriously that Obama is sincere
when he says that Showden should come home and stand trial But I
would guess that if Snowden was given these guarantees of being out
of prison and on bail and free to have an open trial he might come
home But he is not going to get those guarantees, I would guess,
because we live in a different era, here in America too Sophie
Shevardnadze: I want to talk a little
bit more about what has changed, whether the whole NSA leaks have
changed the American society Because if you talk about me and people
around me, who have a post Soviet hangover or had a Soviet
childhood these revelations weren t life changing for us, because
we suspected surveillance in some form or another Many RT viewers
are strongly against any form of surveillance, but still, I know a
lot of Americans that are around and they are not saying Hey, at
this point we re done with the government  For example,
Larry King, he told me that he is actually siding with the government
on surveillance What do you see around you are the people still
shocked, or they are digesting and accepting it in the name of the
War on Terror? Steven
Cohen: I understand what you are saying
about your Russian colleagues surveillance is a problem in Russia
too and it has been a problem for decades And there is a debate in
the Russian media whether the FSB the Russian intelligence agency 
is doing too much or too little And let s be fair, people in
Russia and in the US are afraid of terrorism If you asked me, would
I allow the US government to listen to my phone calls and read my
email if they are going to prevent my children from being killed in a
terrorist explosion in New York City where I live, I would
undoubtedly say, Yes  I ll just be a little more careful in
what I say on the phone and what I write in the email But this is a
major question, and times have changed I m old enough to remember
the Osborne case, when he took the Pentagon papers which documented
the Pentagon and White House line about the war in Vietnam, and then
the New York Times published them Then they were published very
quickly as a book, and Elsberg was on the radio, and on television as
it existed then He was out on bail and famous lawyers came to defend
him And in the end, he was exonerated in a way He won in the
courts That America doesn t exist anymore partly because of what
happened in 9/11, and partly because we fought so many wars Many
Americans are afraid and we have become more accustomed, decade by
decade, to this kind of surveillance So the question that Snowden
raised is, Should we become accustomed to it? Is this really a
trade off between our fears and our privacy that we want to make? 
But I agree with you, the polls have shown I don t remember the
last number that the polls revealed but about half of Americans or
even more were okay with what the government was doing But Sophie,
you know as well as I do that when you take a public opinion poll,
you can give the answer you want by the way you ask the question If
you say in general to Americans are you prepared to give up all
your freedoms that Americans have fought for, for 200 years, and
allow the government to do this kind of possibly illegal
surveillance, a majority would say No  But if you ask people,
 Are you prepared to permit this surveillance so that you and your
children are safe?,  the majority is going to say Yes  It s
just in how you ask the question and you can t ask the question
until you ve had a national discussion which we haven t had and
which the government doesn t want but what Snowden wanted But
again, until Snowden s personal drama ends, or at least calms down
and moves off the front page, we re not going to have that
discussion in our country And even then, we may not have it because
the government doesn t want it Sophie Shevardnadze:Welcome back to the show We re talking about Snowden and how his
Moscow detour can affect the already shaken relationship between
Russia and the US Our guest is Steven Cohen, professor of Russian
Studies and History Good to have you back, Steven So, in your
latest opinion editorials, you keep saying that Russia and the US are
at a hateful crossroads Is Snowden s case icing on the cake? Could
things get really bad after this? Steven
Cohen:I have a historical perspective 
Let me state it again, 22 years after the end of the Soviet Union We
do not have a good relationship with Russia Nobody asks why Rather,
in the US, when people are asked Why,  they will say it s the
fault of Russia Now they say it s the fault of Putin But that is
not correct and certainly not a complete answer We had several
opportunities to establish partnership with Russia in international
affairs The first came in the 1990s after the end of the Soviet
Union, and Clinton with Yeltsin war set opportunities The second
opportunity came after 9/11, when Putin called President George Bush
and said We are with you, what can we do to help the US which has
been attacked by terrorism? We re partners  That opportunity was
lost Then came Obama s so called Reset  with then President
Medvedev, and that opportunity was lost Now, the tragic bombings in
Boston and the tragic civil war in Syria have shown Washington and
Moscow that we need a cooperative relationship and that created yet
another opportunity It s not clear whether we will seize the
opportunity with Snowden the Magnitsky act and other events have
become obstacles on both sides to seizing these opportunities The
larger reason in my opinion which is a minority opinion in America
 is that my generation knew as the Cold War between the Soviet Union
and the US either didn t actually end with the Soviet Union, or
it s come alive again Because everything we ve seen between
Russia and America since the end of the Soviet Union looks, smells,
and behaves like a Cold War relationship It s just that in the US,
our leaders don t want to accept this failure that they lost an
opportunity in post Cold War Russia to create a new relationship, a
partnership with Russia And that s where we are today So it s a
long way to answer, but I think that historians will tell you in the
future and as a historian today, I would tell you that we can t
understand Snowden We can t understand Magnitsky We can t
understand these recent conflicts without putting them into
historical context of a relationship between America and post Soviet
Russia during the last 22 years This is a narrative that hasn t
stopped Sophie
Shevardnadze:You just demonstrated
that obstacles or opportunities to get two countries closer or get
them more apart arise all the time and these talks of the Cold
War have been around forever, or in the past 15 years You seem to be
pointing out that we are now at a hateful crossroads How much worse
are things are now than they were in the Bush Era? Because it seemed
like they were at the lowest then Steven
Cohen:The low point of the
relationship since the end of the Soviet Union was of course the war
with Georgia in 2008 And the reason that that was a low point is
that the US and Russia came close to hot war, not just Cold War 
Georgia began the war, no doubt about that Russia reacted by moving
into South Ossetia It began the fight with the Georgian army which
was, in effect, an American proxy army We created that army We
armed it We trained it There were American military advisors
somewhere in the Georgia, traveling with the Georgian troops There
was a discussion at the White House, led by Dick Cheney, that the US
should bomb the Russian army in South Ossetia Sophie
Shevardnadze:But no one stood up for
the Georgian army there because no one really wants to wage a war
with Russia That s another example of how America and Russia would
never actually go to war Steven
Cohen:I don t know about that,
Sophie Where is that written, that we would never go to war? We were
extremely close in the Cuban Missile crisis, we were extremely close
in Berlin on a number of occasions There were probably occasions
that we haven t been told about, and in my judgment we were close
in Georgia in 2008 No fault of Russia but how many times can we
avoid these dangerous possibilities? My point is, it s the duty of
leadership American leadership and Russian leadership to create
a relationship where these dangers don t appear And we haven t
done that yet And I will say as an American patriot, the primary
fault not the entire fault but the primary fault is in
Washington Until American policy toward Russia changes, things will
not get better And American policy toward Russia hasn t changed on
one fundamental issue: Washington believes in what it calls
 selective cooperation,  which means Russia should make
concessions but Washington does not have to make concessions in
return Until that policy changes, nothing else will change I am
absolutely sure about that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Does that mean that they
don t want a better relationship with Russia? They simply don t
care enough to ameliorate their relationship with Russia? Things are
good as they are? Steven
Cohen:The American political policy
media establishment wants a good relationship with Russia once it s
on America s own terms And it s very clear what that means,
because it has meant the same thing since the Soviet Union Russia
should be a junior and subservient partner to American interests 
Whatever is in the American interest, Russia should help promote So,
if America decides to expand NATO to Russia s borders, Russia
should accept this as a very good idea to its own security If
America decides to build missile installations in Europe or on ships
that threaten Russia s nuclear security, Russia should understand
that that s really against North Korea or Iran, and it doesn t
affect Russia If the US believes that the overthrow of Assad in
Syria will bring peace to the Middle East, Russia should agree The
problem is, Russia doesn t agree Russia is a different
civilization, but the bad precedent was set I don t like to
criticize your leaders because it s your problems by Yeltsin, who
agreed almost on everything And so Washington got into a habit of
getting what it wanted But even ambassador McFaul has said on a
several occasions during the reset  which he claims he invented,
 We re going to negotiate with Moscow, and see what they can do
to promote our national interests  Fine but that s one hand
clapping A real negotiation, real diplomacy, is not that It is
that we go to Moscow and say Here are our interests, will you help
us?  And then Moscow says, We might Here are our interests 
Will you help us?  And then they do something for each other 
Washington doesn t do anything I would defy anybody who thinks I m
being unpatriotic just tell me one major concession that Moscow
has received from Washington since the end of the Soviet Union? Just
one? And when I ask this question, at all just, leading places of
the American establishment, I do get one answer: We gave them
financial loans in the 1990s  Yeah, they were onerous loans which
only Putin, because of high oil prices, could finally pay back 
Although Washington forgave Poland s communist era debt, it never
forgave any of Moscow s debts We have never given Russia
anything By the way, Putin says that over and over and over again,
and Washington says, Why is he so anti American? He is not
anti American, he just made a very simple point that any major leader
would make that a relationship is a two way relationship: We give
something to you, you give something to us, and we go forward and
solve problems We don t have that relationship and we haven t
had it since the Soviet Union ended We had it with the Soviet Union,
but that s another story Sophie
Shevardnadze:The Reset  idea 
is it all forgotten and dead now? Steven
Cohen:In America, it s something
that Obama s enemies use to show how unwise he is and say it
failed The reality is that Obama got what he wanted from the Reset 
 he got Russian help in supplying NATO forces in Afghanistan He
got tougher sanctions against Iran He got Moscow s cancellation of
the C 300 defense system, I think The problem is, once again what
did Moscow get in return? Nothing They wanted a compromise on
missile defense They wanted the end of NATO expansion and an end to
American democracy promotion in Russia But Washington refused So
the Reset  failed, Washington got what it wanted, and now we are
starting all over again The new dÃ©tente we used to call it
 dÃ©tente  during the Cold War is going to fail unless
American policy changes It s a sad story, but it s a true story RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/snowden-case-us-russia-307/
"25 Jun, 2013","NSA surveillance programs approved by two presidents, Congress, courts and will go forward â ex-NSA head","NSA programs revealed by Edward Snowden will continue as they are lawful, appropriate, and effective  and the US people s representatives voted in favor of them, former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said on RT s SophieCo RT:In your opinion, is Snowden a hero or a
 traitor? Michael Hayden:Well, he certainly is not a hero I don t
 think he meets the legal definition of being a traitor 
 according to our Constitution But he certainly has done a very,
 very bad thing and I think he is also a very troubled young man 
 So perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes
 you ve pointed out RT:Do you think he could be a Chinese spy agent? Dick
 Cheney seems to think so? MH:I don t have evidence of it It s a curious thing Why
 would he go to Hong Kong for his refuge while other places are
 available that he could have chosen, and given the state of the
 Sino American relations, particularly when it comes to things
 about the cyber domain, it s really was a curious choice But
 again, no evidence to date I tell you how I would handle it
 while still in government I would make this one of my working
 hypotheses one, not all of my working hypotheses and then try
 to seek out evidence that proves or disproves the
 hypothesis RT:You were the head of NSA and CIA What happens when
 a young colleague of yours, a talented good guy, walks into your
 office and tells you Boss, I think we have the problem with
 PRISM  What do you say to that? MH:Actually, that is a great question What makes all of
 this so troubling is that Mr Snowden didn t do that If he wants
 to be a true whistleblower, you need to go to a supervisor, the
 supervisor s boss or the General Counsel inside the organization
 or the Inspector General or even to members of Congress to
 express his complaints There is a clear structure within the US
 Government to do that Now look I ll be the first to admit that requires great courage
 and human beings being human beings there might be some of them
 who would attempt to take retribution against an officer who
 attempted to do that But that s the right way to do these
 things When somebody comes to you with a concern, certainly,
 it s the truth for me You ve got to take those concerns very
 seriously This is somebody acting out of conscience and you need
 to sit down and talk with that individual and if necessary follow
 up to see if the concerns actually have real merit RT:I remember back in 2007 there were also cases of
 whistleblowing when you were the head of NSA Did these men
 address you with their concerns before they went public with
 their information? MH:I had actually left NSA by 2005 and so those events of
 2007 and 2008 came after I d left I ve no knowledge of that
 other than complaining about some technological decisions that
 were made inside NSA, I ve no knowledge that anything akin to an
 appropriate whistleblower process had begun at the agency RT:General Hayden, with a secrecy breach like this, a
 disaster basically, what s going on inside the NSA and CIA right
 now? You should know as somebody who s being responsible for
 this What are you going to do when the major crisis exposes
 you? MH:What you re looking for is responsibility, not
 necessarily guilt You want people to be open to you, you want a
 clear description with regard to what has happened until you ve
 got the individuals to learn, to create lessons that allow you to
 prevent or at least reduce the possibilities that these kinds of
 things could happen in the future And so you re doing a lot of
 forensics to the system, you re talking to people who knew this
 young man What kind of things did his action suggest about him?
 You re talking to a supervisor What did you suspect about him?
 Did this surprise you? Did you see any kind of indicators? And
 then you are also doing a damage assessment Let me list for you three different lanes in which damages almost
 certainly occurred Number one it tells our adversaries our
 capabilities It tells them what we can do and also tells them
 what we won t do and that can be very damaging Secondly, this
 will punish American firms who have cooperated with NSA Punish
 them, even though all they have ever done is simply obey American
 law and help defend the United States Then finally, if there is
 anyone else out there in the world, another government or
 potential source who might want to have cooperated with the
 United States, why would they trust us when we promise that we
 can keep a secret So all those things are damaging RT:You brought up firms From your own experience have
 social media companies any choice other than to obey NSA
 orders? MH:Again, I m not a part of NSA for a long time now But
 my understanding of the program is that these companies, these
 private concerns were responding to specific court orders and
 under US law they can fight those orders in court, some have done
 that I don t know the results of any of these contentious cases,
 but my suspicion is they won some and they lose some RT:But if they re doing everything that is legal, why
 are you saying they ll be punished? MH:Because these are international firms And although
 acting very consistently with the American law, there ll be
 others in the world who ll look at them with suspicion And
 certainly, from my point of view, unwanted suspicion That s
 what s going to happen RT:What s happening to the programs like the ones
 Snowden made public, this PRISM data collecting tool? Are they
 being wrapped up right now or is the NSA going to go ahead with
 it, in your opinion? MH:I would see no reason why either of the programs that
 he revealed, the metadata program or the PRISM program, why they
 would be stopped They re lawful, they re appropriate, they re
 effective But the effectiveness may be the element that is most
 harmed by these revelations Again, adversaries now know what we
 can do and also know what we won t do the boundaries of
 American law and policy And that gives them a higher probability
 that they ll be able to protect their communications from United
 States agencies trying to intercept them RT:Though the PRISM is huge and it has turned America
 into a database platform for all its access to Facebook, Google,
 Yahoo, Microsoft, I mean it missed Tsarnaevs [the brothers who
 allegedly organized two explosions at the Boston Marathon] online
 activity prior to the Boston bombing Are you maybe casting a net
 too wide? MH:Actually the Tsarnaevs were not detected by any
 program like this because PRISM isn t suitable for detecting the
 kind of communication that Tsarnaev brothers had prior to the
 Boston bombing I mean PRISM is about foreigners It requires a
 belief on the part of the National Security Agency that those
 people we want to monitor are foreigners and have foreign
 intelligence value We ve got to prove in broad terms to an
 American court before we can insist that one of these companies
 assist us in their effort RT:President Obama has claimed surveillance programs
 have stopped 50 attacks But since these programs began operating
 shortly after 9/11 how many terrorist attacks were prevented
 solely by information gathered from these PRISM like programs
 that could not be gained through any other source? MH:Right That s a great question and I don t want to be
 indirect with my answer, but I m going to be indirect I don t
 know whether it is a correct answer to your question how many
 have been prevented only to the efforts of these two programs In
 actuality, I cannot point to any program very often that is the
 sole reason that we have the intelligence success One of the
 great achievements of the American intelligence in the past dozen
 years is that we ve been able to blend multiple streams of
 information with a little bit sub data here and a little bit
 sub data there That we ve been able to combine into a meaningful
 picture In other words we ve been able to pick up shards of
 glass that individually have no meaning, but because we have a
 collectively large number of shards, we can actually combine them
 into a very meaningful mosaic RT:I ve got another quote from Snowden: The consent
 of the governed is not consent if it s not informed  I think
 it s frank to say that a lot of people feel uncomfortable after
 these leaks, because it s seems like you break into my home, you
 listen to my phone calls, you interceptÂ  my emails, my
 private SMSs without telling me you re doing it And you re
 labeling all that as war on terror  I mean, can you really not
 fight war on terror and protect privacy, my privacy? MH:Well, I think the president was right when he said the
 responsible government has to make choices You can t have
 absolute privacy and absolute security, there always has to be a
 balance between the two The balance, frankly, is based upon the
 totality of its circumstances: what is the nature of the threat?
 How real is that threat? How imminent is that threat? How
 effective is this tool in detecting that threat? I think I agree
 with the president This is the suitable balance Now I should
 point out that some of the things you ve said Americans are
 saying, are simply errors of fact We aren t doing many of those
 things Unfortunately, here in the US, when these kinds of stories get
 out into the public domain, I am fond of saying, they are rushed
 into the darkest corner of the room as rapidly as possible So
 what is the important thing is to make sure that the American
 people exactly understand what we re doing Now to go back to
 Snowden s quote about the concern of the governed this is not
 ancient Athens This isn t a direct democracy where we allow the
 entire population to vote on every proposition We are
 representative democracy The people s representatives were
 informed of these programs and they voted in favor of them 
 They ve been approved by two presidents, they ve been approved by
 the American court system In the American system, at the
 executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch
 lying out, it doesn t get any better than that in terms of
 concern of the governed RT:I mean, the security is not really state religion
 that cannot be questioned, and if you question it, than you re
 not loyal Now you re saying that that the PRISM hasn t spied on
 Americans?It hasn t gone into private emails? MH:No The predicate for PRISM is that the target of the
 surveillance is a foreigner and what s happened is that story has
 been confused with the metadata story, which is indeed about
 Americans, but it s about American phone records, not American
 conversations or communications RT:What exactly does it tell you about your system
 when your own people blow the whistle on you? Because it s not
 the first time MH:No, it s not I mentioned before that I believe Mr 
 Snowden was not a hero, he had committed a crime But he was also
 a troubled young man, let me phrase it for you this way: What
 kind of moral arrogance is required to believe your personal
 moral judgment trumps that of two presidents, two houses of our
 Congress, the American courts and over 30,000 of your coworkers 
 I would admit in American society, as in Russian society, we have
 a generation of young folks whose kind of absolute commitment to
 transparency which is well beyond anything of my generation and
 even my children s generation We re now, like the Russian
 security services or any security service throughout the world,
 recruiting from populations whose views toward secrecy and
 openness are a bit different than those that have been
 traditionally held by the people we have recruited in a former
 age So you ve got Mr Snowden, you ve got Private Manning, both
 of whom have an almost romantic attachment to revealing secrets 
 But in both cases this commitment to absolute transparency has
 created great harm to the security of people around the world RT:If not whistleblowers, who else can stop you in
 case you push it too far? There must be checks and balances
 everywhere, right? MH:You re right There is a tactical point for you A
 whistleblower has to point out unlawful activity Even Snowden
 admits this wasn t unlawful He claims that it was unwise, it was
 inconsistent with his personal value system, but no one claims it
 was unlawful, it was consistent with law It was done under the
 record order with the knowledge of the Congress And it s hard
 for me to imagine that anyone would afford him whistleblower
 status, at least in the technical, legal definition of the term 
 Now, where do you get debate? You get debate in our
 Representative Government You get debate from a judge who pushes
 back saying he is uncomfortable with the outlines of the court
 order we want him to sign You get debate in the American
 Congress, where members, particularly at the intelligence
 oversight committees, get a chance to look at these programs and
 to pass on their merits of the as to whether or not they would
 authorized them or appropriate funds for them RT:Are you really saying that giving all the details
 of my private life to a government agency is the new normal, a
 new patriotic norm? MH:No, no, not at all And again what you re saying,
 that s a reflection as to how badly reported this story has been 
 The details of your private life are not being shared with the
 government These two programs that the government gets is a
 macro database of phone calls that just fact of call, nothing
 more With regard to the PRISM program, as I ve already said, it
 focuses on foreign communications of intelligence value to the
 United States That s what the National Security Agency might
 add, what the FSB [Russia s security agency] is all about RT:The whole thing is that may be if the Security
 State was a little more transparent like Obama promised before
 he was elected president, then maybe the American public and the
 foreigners would be more comfortable with programs like
 PRISM MH:You bring up a wonderful point Somebody with my
 background, coming from the security services we re reluctant
 to say much about anything We actually think we re more
 operationally effective the less our adversaries know about what
 it is we re doing But we also realize we work in a democracy 
 I m now fond of saying that in the American democracy the
 president probably gets to do anything one off, one time based
 upon his presidential authority and a narrow definition that it s
 simply lawful But in our system the president doesn t get to do
 anything over a long period of time without generalized popular
 support, and you re right, you don t get generalized popular
 support unless the American people, and especially their
 representatives, have some sense of broad knowledge, maybe not
 detailed, but broad knowledge about what their government is
 doing on their behalf I now have to admit, even as a security professional, that we may
 have to make these things more public  things that actually
 might make us a little less effective, so that we can make the
 American population more comfortable about what it is we re
 doing Otherwise the American population, the American democracy,
 will tell us to stop doing all of what we re doing We re going
 to have to have these tradeoffs  transparency, popular
 acceptance and operational effectiveness RT:General Hayden, you ve brought up your security
 background, but you ve also come from a long line of Republicans 
 What is the Republican point of view on all of this, I mean, how
 does the less government idea sit in with all of this? MH:I think your view is very interesting and dynamic here
 in the United States I mean, let me first of all challenge the
 assessment that I was Republican and I was selected to be the
 head of the CIA by a Republican President, but I was selected to
 be the head of NSA by a Democratic President [Bill] Clinton But
 your question is about the Republican Party It s quite interesting here in the American political system that
 the extreme right of the Republican Party and the extreme left of
 the Democrat Party seem to be coming together with regard to the
 coming concern about some of the things that the center is doing
 to keep Americans safe and free So you do actually have some
 Republicans criticizing this program on civil liberties less
 government is better government  grounds, rather than addressing
 the program on what is frankly more traditional Republican ground
 on the grounds of national security RT:At the end of the day the fact is that the
 PRISM gate has damaged Obama s reputation personally He has also
 undermined the reputation of his office, of the American
 presidency in the eyes of the world We saw how he was in front
 of [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel in Germany and he had to
 justify himself, he had to justify PRISM for the whole world Do
 you think this scandal, these leaks, will actually make him push
 to security state back even if he doesn t want to do that? Do you
 think he can challenge the whole thing? MH:I think there is a bit of fear going on in this, with
 all due respect to the leading figures in Germany or the United
 States, alright? Let s all admit very candidly that all nations
 conduct espionage All of them do We ve focused on the US now
 because we actually are more transparent about espionage than any
 other country on Earth That s really what the issue is here 
 That s why this is a publicly discussable item But it s not
 because what America s doing is unique RT:How can ranking officials be an exception? Because
 leaks say foreign officials were bagged more than once, for
 example at the G20 summit in London How does spying over
 then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev s calls help fight the War
 on Terror? MH:I have no views on any actual operation activity of
 American intelligence services and I would also in view that all
 nations on this planet have legitimate foreign intelligence
 concerns beyond the War on Terror This is just not about
 terrorism, it s about foreign intelligence I repeat, all nations
 conduct foreign intelligence RT:Just to wrap it up, given what we ve discussed, do
 you for see a rollback on the surveillance state in general, a
 cut back on it, or is it going to go with the same pace? MH:What I foresee is these two programs, the very light
 touch on the American privacy created by the metadata phone
 program and the PRISM program, my personal judgment  they both
 go forward They ve already had wide bipartisan support They
 will continue But what we ve been talking about here today, what
 my country [and] many people around the world have been talking
 about for the past two weeks, that will generate a global
 discussion about what is the meaning of privacy in the internet
 era, what are the true rules, what are the legitimate
 expectations of privacy in the world in which everyone is
 connected I had an advisory board at CIA and I would give them tough
 problems One of the tough problems I gave them was this question
 of security and transparency Here I frame the question, I said
 will the US be able to conduct espionage in the future inside a
 broader political culture, but every day demand more transparency
 and more public accountability from every aspect of the national
 life?  They studied the problem and came back to me and their
 final answer was We re not sure  This episode onSophieCo programm s page RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/security-transparency-popular-support-director-193/

global intelligence corporations like Stratfor and its foreign
offshoot CANVAS worked hard over the past decade (aided and abetted
by US Government agencies) in a failed attempt to overthrow
Venezuela s democratically elected president Hugo Chavez The US corporate over world has always worked closely with the
CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon promoting the overthrow
 known as regime change in rogue states  of governments
that do not automatically align to US interests; or, better said,
of governments that do not automatically align with the interests
of the supra national global power elite that is deeply embedded
inside private and public power structures in the US This has been especially true throughout Latin America,
traditionally America s geopolitical and economic backyard, from
Mexico to Tierra del Fuego For example, September 11th of this year (of all dates!) marks
the 40th anniversary of the CIA backed, financed and orchestrated
overthrow and assassination of Chile s democratically elected
president, Salvador Allende Allende was replaced by a pro US and pro UK military junta
headed by General Augusto Pinochet   At the time, private
corporations like ITT worked hand in hand with CIA operatives
promoting strikes, social turmoil and waging psychological warfare
through the local media   Then it was Chile; now it s
Venezuela In fact, the 1970s and 1980s saw the Kissinger designed and
executed Condor Plan finance and diplomatically support
various military coups and regimes not only in Chile but in
Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay and other countries in the
region Such US UK support for authoritarian and criminal regimes would
only stop when some Latin American general like Argentina s General
Leopoldo Galtieri went too far by doing something really stupid,
like Argentina s 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands Barring that, all those US backed coups used local military
strongmen trained in the US Military s School of the Americas in
Panama to do as they pleased in their local countries, as long as:
(a) they kept those countries aligned to US geopolitical
imperatives which during the Cold War meant being staunchly
anti Communist; (b) accepted Chicago Boys style financial
dependency and artificially created public debts; (c) kept local
populations in permanent fear and thus disciplined and
orderly Since the fall of the former Soviet Union, however, these
tactics changed dramatically   Now US control over Latin
American countries is centred on promoting democracy Well, actually, the kind of democracy that we want to see, as Hillary Clinton so eloquently put it when visiting Arab
Spring Egypt back in March 2011 Such money controlled democracy is, of course, no democracy at
all, but rather an obscene money sloshing and media clownery system
that catapults their favourite candidates into local positions of
power When the US has its way as in Mexico, Colombia and Chile, and
their candidates win local elections, then it s all business as
usual But when growing political awareness among the local populace
elects presidents into power who prioritize the local national
interest as in Ecuador (who just re elected their fine president
Rafael Correa), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and, most notably, Venezuela
with Hugo Chavez, then the regime change mega juggernaut comes
into full action In America, you never know whether it s the White House and
Congress running the country and the corporate over world, or if
it s the other way around: The corporate over world runs the White
House, Congress and the country Recent WikiLeaks documents released on Venezuela describes
Stratfor as a company that fronts as an intelligencepublisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to
large corporations such as Bhopal s Dow Chemical Co , Lockheed
Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies,
including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines
and the US Defence Intelligence Agency  The emails, WikiLeaks goes on to explain, show
Stratfor s web of informers, pay off structure, payment laundering
techniques and psychological methods  The filtered emails cover a wide range of issues on the energy
sector, especially oil; political change and the state of
right wing forces inside Venezuela; and the state of the country s
armed forces They also refer to Venezuela s relations with Cuba,
China, Russia and Iran, and provide bleak projections for the
economy and the financial sector The Serbian based and US supported Center for Applied
Non Violent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) is yet another such
 global intelligence front of what, in practice, are organizations
specializing in engineering social turmoil even civil war as
countries like Serbia, Libya, Afghanistan and Syria have painfully
learned The leaked emails from CANVAS had them explaining their
recommended strategy for toppling governments, as in one revealing
message to Stratfor: When somebody asks us for help, as in Vene (sic!) case, we
usually ask them the question and how would you do it? That
means that the first thing is to create a situational analysis (the
word doc I sent you) and after that comes Mission Statement 
(still left to be done) and then Operational Concept , which is
the plan for campaign For this case we have three campaigns:
Unification of opposition, campaign for [September 2010
parliamentary elections] and parallel with that a get out and
vote campaign  Very straightforward! Stratfor s founder and chairman is one George Friedman, who is
regularly interviewed in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC and CNN and
is advisor to JPMorganChase, CitiGroup and Ernst & Young  
Stratfor s president & CEO is Shea Morenz, who for many years
was a senior officer at Goldman Sachs   Not exactly
corporations and megabanks bent on promoting the common good of the
people of Venezuela, or of any other country in Latin America or
elsewhere Clearly, there are no sharp lines separating these private
intelligence publishers and analysts, think tanks like the Council
on Foreign Relations, RAND Corporation, National Endowment for
Democracy and major corporations, from public US Government
agencies like the CIA, NSA, USAID and the State
Department In fact, throughout Latin America, lucid political observers
will always keep an eye on what La Embajada is up to La Embajada is Spanish for The Embassy  
not just any embassy, of course, but the local Embassy of the
United States No surprise then to learn that this batch of WikiLeaks documents
reveals US based firms working to overthrow Hugo Chavez by
assisting and financing opposition candidates like Henrique
Capriles Radonsky, who was Chavez s main opposition candidate,
coming in second place in last year s presidential elections Capriles Radonsky is strongly backed by US, European and
Israeli   interests, thanks to his notable alignment to those
countries objectives in Venezuela and the region   Of Jewish
background in a country with a very tiny Jewish community 
Radonsky promises to steer Venezuela away from the close ties
forged by Chavez with Iran, Cuba, Russia, China and (until it was
overrun and destroyed by NATO) also Libya Due to President Chavez s ailing health, this public private US
initiative is again hard at work promoting all opposition forces
inside Venezuela, whilst they eagerly await good news (for them)
about president Chavez s condition, hoping that he may have to
relinquish the presidency he won late last year, which would mean
new elections in a Venezuela without Chavez That would spell real tragedy for that country, as the US
public private initiative would again go into full lets get our boy into the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas Mode A tragedy not just for Venezuela but for the entire region as
well, where the US continues holding full sway in countries like
Colombia whose president Juan Manuel Santos is a member of the
Rockefeller funded, New York based Americas Society that promotes
in roads into Latin America for the powerful Council on Foreign
Relations, whose head office is just across the street from them on
Park Avenue at 57th Street And Mexico recently elected pro US
rich boy Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto as president Two countries where it s
business as usual In advising on how to engineer destabilisation, CANVAS told
Stratfor, that We only give them the tools to use Referring to the 2010 parliamentary elections, they wrote, This
year we are definitely ramping up activity in Venezuela ¦ they have
elections in September and we are in close connection with
activists from there and people trying to help them (please keep
this to yourself for now, no publication) The first phase of our
preparation is under way  So, this is the kind of democracy the US wants to see Or, as Don Corleone in The Godfather would recommend to
agents and operatives if he sat in the State Department or the CIA: Make it look like a democratic election  Maybe Corleone s best disciples are actually running the show

"1 Mar, 2013",US help might see Syrian rebels form alternate govt,"The long term US funding of anti government programs in Syria has raised questions about the types of groups being supported, and the benefits and arms supplied to militant groups; establishing political stability requires considered dialogue It appears that the US State Department under John Kerry will
soon shift its focus to helping the rebels establish a full fledged
alternative government on Syrian territory and recognize it as the
legal government of Syria Such a move would legitimize the
transfer of heavy weaponry and would allow the US to directly
employ air strikes or Patriot anti missile batteries against
Assad s forces Some would argue that these moves could help to marginalize the
notable al Qaeda presence among rebel forces Pumping more arms and
heavier weapons into Syria is unconscionable at this point, and
continuing to do so will inevitably bolster the muscle and reach of
jihadi and Salafist fighters The argument that the US and its
allies have only armed the moderate  rebels is a deeply flawed
one; weapons are in high demand by all rebel factions and there is
little means to effectively prevent arms from gravitating toward
hardcore Al Qaeda fighters In his famous 1962 description of irregular warfare operations,
US President John F Kennedy alluded to another type of
warfare, one that is new in its intensity, ancient in its
origin war by guerrillas, subversives, insurgents, assassins; war
by ambush instead of by combat, by infiltration instead of
aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy
instead of engaging him It preys on unrest  After two harrowing years of division, senseless killing and
civil war, the scared Syrian nation and its people are well
acquainted with these unconventional methods of warfare denounced
over 50 years ago Yet Western and Gulf states have proven their double standards
by enabling radicals elsewhere lest we forget the presence of
Libyan military commander Abdulhakim Belhadj, former leader of the
militant Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (officially designated as a
terrorist organization by the US State Department), who was sent to
Syria to aid the Free Syrian Army on orders of the entity formerly
known as the Libyan National Transition Council (NTC) The track
record of allied Western and Gulf states shows that they are more
interested in enabling terrorism for their own purposes rather than
preventing it Since the eruption of violence in March 2011, Syria has endured
targeted assassination campaigns, ceaseless suicide bombings and
shelling, and massacres where infants have had their throats slit
to the spine the time has come for the opposition to engage the
Assad government in dialogue and finally bring about a ceasefire
and the total cessation of violence and insurgency From the reports of third party sniper fire targeting both
protesters and security personnel in the southern city of Daraa at
the very onset of the conflict, to the horrendous attacks on the
students of Aleppo University in January 2013 those who have
critically monitored the situation from the beginning are under no
illusions the influx of armament and mercenary elements from
abroad into Syria has brought the situation to where it is today 
Western capitals have provided logistics, coordination, political
support, and non lethal aid, Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and
Qatar have openly provided weapons and monthly salaries for rebel
fighters, and Turkey has allowed rebel fighters to receive training
and arms from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the
southeastern part of the country, allowing militants to pass into
Syria freely There are those who say that Syria is the subject of an internal
revolution that is brutally repressed by a malicious dictator, and
those who say instead that Syria is being attacked by foreign
powers who have deployed mercenaries and extremist fighters from
abroad to engage in the destruction of infrastructure and conduct
targeted assassinations to bring about an end to the Assad
regime   Despite Washington s concerns of heavy weapons
falling into the hands of Al Qaeda linked militants, the US backed
campaign to coax regime change in Damascus has from the very onset
enabled militants who justify their acts of terror in the name of a
perverted interpretation of Islam Reports in the Washington Post
indicate that US support for anti government groups in Syria began
in 2005, transcending two presidential administrations: The article describes how Washington funnelled about $12 million
to anti government programs in Syria between 2005 and 2010 to
recipients affiliated with the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood Israel,
which is now illegally conducting exploratory drilling in the
occupied Golan Heights, and the US view the toppling of Damascus as
a means of extinguishing the critical conduit between Iran and
Hezbollah, the political and militant Shi a organization centered
in Southern Lebanon, in addition to helping isolate the Palestinian
resistance Both the incumbent Syrian authorities and the opposition must
find strength to come to a mutually acceptable compromise These
parties have no other option than to search for a solution, lay
down an agreeable constitutional basis for elections, and face each
other in international monitored polls once the situation
stabilizes The Syrian people must not have democracy imposed on
them, and the victor of this war should not be decided on the
battlefield, but by the ballot box To gain the confidence of the electorate, election observers from
the US, Qatar, Russia, and Iran could be sent to monitor the
transition process if the people of Syria want Assad to remain in
power, then the rule of majority must be honored Militant groups
comprised of mostly hard line foreign fighters such as Jabhat
al Nusra and the Islamist Ahrar al Sham cannot be expected to
participate in a ceasefire, so the true test of a short term
alliance between Assad and the SNC would be in its ability to
cooperate in quelling radical militants and restoring stability 
such is a perquisite for any kind of transition Former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton once threatened Russia
and China that they would pay a price  for their position on the
Syrian issue It should be noted that these powers maintained a
balanced approach throughout and advocated dialogue from the start,
in addition to stringently adhering to former UN Envoy Kofi Annan s
six point peace plan Iran should also be given due credit for
hosting an International Consultative Conference in August 2012,
which brought together representatives of thirty nations to call
for ending the flow of foreign arms into terrorist hands inside
Syria, proposals to broker a meaningful ceasefire, the coordination
of humanitarian aid, and support for Syrian people s right to
reform without foreign interference Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi was quoted in the
Washington Post stating, Syrian society is a beautiful mosaic
of ethnicities, faiths and cultures, and it will be smashed to
pieces should President Bashar Assad abruptly fall The idea that,
in that event, there would be an orderly transition of power is an
illusion Abrupt political change without a roadmap for managed
political transition will lead only to a precarious situation that
would destabilize one of the world s most sensitive regions It is clear that the Assad government is more stable than many
Western states anticipated, and it continues to enjoy popular
support Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah recently warned against
sectarian infighting in Lebanon related to the Syrian civil war,
arguing that outsiders are pushing Lebanon toward civil and
religious strife, and specifically Sunni Shia strife Iraqi PM
Nouri al Maliki also warned that a victory for rebels would create a new extremist haven and destabilize the wider Middle
East The Syrian regime will not imminently collapse but if it
is brought down by military intervention, the consequences could
lead to a highly unpredictable situation where match and tinder can
meet at any moment with debilitating consequences for the region 
It is time for both parties to convene It is time to end this
war Reports published in 2007 in the New Yorker by veteran
journalist Seymour Hersh detail how the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia
supported a regional network of extremist fighters and terrorists
affiliated with al Qaeda with the aim of stomping out Hezbollah and
Syria s Assad in a bid to isolate Iran, who is viewed as an
existential threat to the US and its allies in the region A
principal component of this policy shift was the bolstering of
Sunni extremist groups, hence the ever deepening sectarian nature
of the Syrian conflict: While the CIA has purportedly claimed to distribute arms only to secular and moderate rebel forces, Washington
insiders from various academic and think tank circles have openly
endorsed bizarre positions in favor of integrating terrorists into
Syria s rebel forces Al Qaeda s Specter in Syria,  penned by
Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Ed Husain, argues in
favor of Al Qaeda terrorists and their inclusion in the Free Syrian
Army, stating, The influx of jihadis brings discipline,
religious fervour, battle experience from Iraq, funding from Sunni
sympathizers in the Gulf, and most importantly, deadly results In
short, the FSA needs al Qaeda now Foreign Policy s, Two
Cheers for Syrian Islamists, penned by Gary Gambill of the heavily
neo conservative Middle East Forum, argues in favor of Al Qaeda, Islamists many of them hardened by years of fighting U S 
forces in Iraq are simply more effective fighters than their
secular counterparts Assad has had extraordinary difficulty
countering tactics perfected by his former jihadist allies,
particularly suicide bombings and roadside bombs While many Western media outlets once likened Syria s rebels to
pro democracy freedom fighters, it has become more challenging to
view them as anything other than Salafist radicals the former s
existence was amplified specifically to provide cover and
legitimacy for the violence and subversion of the latter As a
result of a foreign backed insurgency, the Assad regime resorted to
tactics of shelling and conducing air strikes on rebel strongholds,
which were mostly in densely populated urban areas It should not
be denied that these heavy handed tactics have also led to a
substantial and regrettable loss of life The Friends of Syria group recently convened in Rome, where the
US State Department has pledged $60 million to help the opposition
maintain the institutions of the state in areas under their
control, such as establishing terms of governance, the rule of law,
and police forces Reports have also claimed that the US is also
deliberating more open engagement in Syria under newly appointed US
Secretary of State John Kerry, however Washington has stopped short
of openly providing arms and military training American and
western officials have told the New York Times that Saudi Arabia
has recently financed a large purchase of infantry weapons from
Croatia and funnelled them to Syrian rebel groups Although the
United States is not credited with providing arms to rebel forces,
the New York Times has reported the presence of CIA operatives in
southern Turkey since June 2012, who are distributing weapons with
the Obama administration s blessing US spokesperson Jay Carney was
quoted as saying, We will continue to provide assistance to the
Syrian people, to the Syrian opposition, we will continue to
increase our assistance in the effort to bring about a post Assad
Syria In early March 2013, the Syrian National Council (SNC) will meet
in Istanbul to form a provisional government that would oversee
rebel held areas of the country This wouldn t be the first time
the SNC has attempted to form a government; previous attempts in
January 2013 fell apart, with many factions refusing to consider a
prime ministerial nominee SNC President Moaz al Khatib has angered
several factions for proposing his readiness to negotiate with the
Assad government, a position that many in the opposition refuse to
accept The Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashar al Jaafari has urged the
Friends of Syria states to convince the Syrian opposition to sit
down for an unconditional national dialogue, which al Khatib has
expressed his willingness to take part in One could surmise that
al Khatib s shift toward dialogue indicates that the SNC is feeling
less secure and more wary of a possible military defeat or rivalry
with radical factions Such a dialogue would undoubtedly represent
a step in the right direction Despite political differences and
two years of deep conflict, these two parties must establish a

"14 Feb, 2013",Russia will not tolerate foreign pressure â Putin,"Russian President Putin has defended the right of citizens to express their views and organize political parties, but drew the line at those that receive their funding from abroad The constitutional right of citizens to the freedom of speech is inviolable and unshakeable,  Putin declared at an expanded session of the Federal Security Service (FSB) on Thursday However, nobody has a right to sow hatred and rock society and the country, thus jeopardizing the life, wellbeing and peace of millions of our citizens The Russian leader mentioned the recent restrictions that were placed on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work on specific projects in Russia, yet receive their funding from abroad Nobody has a right to speak on behalf of the entire country, especially those groups and structures that rely on foreign funding for their existence, Putin said In September, Russia ordered the closure of USAID, which had been operating in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, after it was discovered that the organization was providing funds for NGOs that seek to influence the political process, including elections at various levels and civil society The United States denied that USAID s programs were aimed at interfering in Russia s internal affairs In July, Putin signed legislation requiring NGOs that receive funding from abroad to register as foreign agents The law requires that Russian based NGOs show how their funding from abroad is being spent in Russia However, the President noted during the meeting that individuals and groups that use such structures to express their views on social development and organize new political parties will be supported by the state President Putin, noting the direct connection between extremist and terrorist groups, also discussed the importance of preventing people, the youth from being dragged into terrorist groups and militant gangs,  and disrupting their means of disseminating their messages We should act resolutely to break up the different types of extremist structures, and thwart the attempts of extremists to use the capabilities of modern information technologies, Internet resources and social networks for their propaganda, the Russian leader stressed However, these well planned special operations  must be implemented with perfectly legal and juridical transparency, Putin said The Russian leader then drew attention to what he described as the need to develop a uniform system as promptly as possible  that will be able to detect, prevent and repel  computer attacks against Russia s information resources Putin s comments then moved to the issue of employing anti terrorism safeguards at industrial facilities, transportation and energy producing facilities This is significant, he explained, especially as Russia prepares to play host to a number of international events, including the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014  Putin then forewarned the high ranking security officers of likely outside efforts to impede the integration processes in the post Soviet space We might be faced and are being faced with attempts to slow down integration work, for which ends various instruments or pressure might be used, including the so called mechanisms of soft power, he said The Russian leader, declaring that it is the sovereign right of Russia and our partners  to build and develop integration projects, emphasized the need for close contact with Russia s partners in Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries that are participating in the integration process, recalling recent emotional rhetoric  surrounding the issue In December, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton explained Russia s efforts to promote greater integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a move to re Sovietize the region  It s not going to be called that,  Clinton said It s going to be called a customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that But let s make no mistake about it We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow it down or prevent it Close integration is an objective and general process and it cannot be stopped by any peremptory shouts or cries, Putin said He concluded his remarks by saying that Russian counterintelligence services had identified nearly 200 agents of foreign special services in 2012: Operations conducted by our counterintelligence services last year prevented activities of 34 career intelligence officers and 181 agents of foreign special services last year Twelve of them were caught red handed Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/putin-security-russia-217/
"30 Jan, 2013",âRussia is ending its dependency on the global superpowerâ â Pushkov,"Moscow announced that it has terminated an agreement with Washington to cooperate in law and drug enforcement, continuing the trend of deteriorating diplomatic relations Russia is reforming its relationship with the US We have terminated the third agreement with the U S in the last six months,  Aleksey Pushkov, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Lower House, commented on Twitter Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed an order to terminate the bilateral deal, the government said in a statement on its official website on Wednesday The agreement, formalized between Russia and the US on September 25, 2002, was declared out of touch with today s realities and has exhausted its potential,  the statement read The Russian Foreign Ministry has been instructed to notify Washington of the decision As part of the now defunct bilateral deal, the US agreed to provide financial assistance to relevant Russian entities for anti crime measures, among other activities Such philanthropy, however, has raised eyebrows in Russia and prompted questions over the real motive behind Washington s efforts It was largely due to these suspicions that Moscow informed the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in September that its services in Russia were no longer wanted or needed In a recent interview with NPR, outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented on Russia s decision to shut down the USAID office: We can take our aid money and go elsewhere and help people who welcome us Clinton s comment goes far towards explaining the rift in Russia US relations: Russia has largely escaped from the clutches of its post Soviet depression, and now has a dynamic economy with a growing middle class and huge natural resources The message from Moscow is that Russia no longer needs handouts from Washington The Foreign Ministry said that Russian civil society has become fully mature, and did not need any external direction from USAID, which was also blamed for attempting to manipulate Russia s internal political processes Is Washington, feeling a bit like a jaded partner in a tumultuous relationship, seeking to break off the honeymoon in dramatic fashion?Last year, the decision by a group of US legislators to implement the so called Magnitsky Act against specific Russian officials who the US Senators believe should be held accountable in the death of Sergey Magnitsky, an accountant with Hermitage Capital who died in prison in 2009 amidst a tax evasion investigation has triggered a diplomatic domino effect between the two countries Shortly after the passage of the Magnitsky Act, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the Dima Yakovlev bill, which bans American citizens from adopting Russian orphans In an interview with US media, Prime Minister Medvedev emphasized that Russia s decision to introduce the adoption legislation had no connection with US legislation against Russian citizens This law expresses concerns of the Russian parliament, the Russian State Duma and the Federal Council over destiny of our children Therefore, despite the fact that many saw it as targeting individual American citizens who want to adopt Russian children, that s certainly not the case,  Medvedev told CNN The US also recently said it would end its cooperation in the Russian American Bilateral Presidential Commission on Civil Society This ongoing atmosphere of animosity between the two former Cold War rivals shows that relations between Moscow and Washington have entered a cooling period It also shows that Russia is less willing to depend on the United States for services that it can afford on its own Meanwhile, Russian experts say that relations between Moscow and Washington have entered a dangerous tit for tat stage and warned against further escalation  Honorary chairman of the Foreign and Defense Policy Council, Sergey Karaganov told RIA Novosti news agency that in his view Russia and US have put themselves on a path that is very difficult to step off At the same time, the analyst noted that the so called reset had not created any solid foundation for better relations between the two countries Karaganov added that he hoped that the leaders of the two nations would be wise enough not to allow further deterioration in relations Viktor Kuvaldin of the Gorbachev Foundation also urged the leaders of Russia and the United States to put an end to the standoff as soon as possible Unfortunately, when a spiral starts unwinding it acquires its own logic People tend to forget who started what and resort to the eye for an eye tooth for a tooth policy, Kuvaldin said Russian authorities should stop the process and reach an agreement with their US partners so that they (Washington) would follow suit Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights

"25 Jan, 2013",Moscow regrets US pullout from bilateral commission on human rights,"The United States has delivered the latest setback to Russia US relations by announcing it will no longer participate in the Russian American Bilateral Presidential Commission on Civil Society We regret whenever a bilateral format is canceled without an appropriate substitute, presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov told Interfax Moscow did not receive the US announcement through official diplomatic channels, but rather via news agencies [The US announcement] has until now reached us verbally; we have not yet received any written official documents on Washington s decision to withdraw from this format of dialogue with Russia, Konstantin Dolgov, the Foreign Ministry s envoy on human rights, democracy and supremacy of law, told reporters on Friday The US decision to quit the Working Group on Civil Society of the Russian American Bilateral Presidential Commission was announced by Thomas Melia, deputy secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, in an interview with Interfax Melia said the bilateral working group is no longer an appropriate or effective forum that would facilitate the development and strengthening of civil society At the same time, he emphasized that the United States will continue to work in the field of human rights with the Russian government and civil society We remain firmly committed to working with the Russian civil society in support of its objectives, including by further strengthening the links between the civil societies of Russia and the United States, Melia said The US government is prepared to be honest and open dialogue on civil society and human rights with the Russian government and Russian civil society Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that Washington will continue cooperating with Moscow on as many areas as we can where we see interest in cooperation, whether they are bilateral issues, whether they are regional issues, or whether they are global issues  But we will also speak straight when we have disagreements, as we have, whether it was on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, whether it was on human rights, whether it was on Syria,  she added The US Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission was inaugurated on July 6, 2009 by US President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the so called reset in relations between the two former Cold War foes The declared Mission Statement of the Commission is, in part, identifying areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international security, economic well being, and the development of ties between the Russian and American people The US announcement came on the same day that the president of the Russian International Affairs Council, Igor Ivanov, said he expects US foreign policy to be more energetic and even tough during Barack Obama s second presidential term In my recent conversation with John Kerry [who is anticipated to replace Hillary Clinton as the new Secretary of State], he said that now is not the time for loud statements, but a time for specific actions, Ivanov said Aside from the group on civil society, the US Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission has a multitude of other organizations that work in various diverse fields, including agriculture, arms control, counter terrorism, military technology, health and the environment Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-us-human-rights-adoptions-746/
"26 Dec, 2012",US attempting regime change in Malaysia: Fact or fiction? (Op-Ed),"As the South East Asian nation of Malaysia prepares for general elections, distrust of the political opposition and accusations of foreign interference have been major talking points in the political frequencies emanating from Kuala Lumpur The United Malays National Organization (UMNO) leads the country s ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and has maintained power since Malaysian independence in 1957 One of Malaysia s most recognizable figures is former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been credited with ushering in large scale economic growth and overseeing the nation s transition from an exporter of palm oil, tin, and other raw materials, into an industrialized economy that manufactures automobiles and electronic goods The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who once held the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mahathir s administration, but was sacked over major disagreements on how to steer Malaysia s economy during the 1997 Asian financial crisis Today, the political climate in Malaysia is highly polarized and a sense of unpredictability looms over the nation Malaysia s current leader, Prime Minister Najib Razak, has pursued a reform minded agenda by repealing authoritarian legislation of the past and dramatically loosening controls on expression and political pluralism introduced under Mahathir s tenure Najib has rolled back Malaysia s Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detention without trial, and has liberalized rules regarding the publication of books and newspapers During Malaysia s 2008 general elections, the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition experienced its worst result in decades, with the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition winning 82 parliamentary seats For the first time, the ruling party was deprived of its two thirds parliamentary majority, which is required to pass amendments to Malaysia s Federal Constitution In the run up to elections scheduled to take place before an April 2013 deadline, figures from all sides of the political spectrum are asking questions about the opposition s links to foreign funders in Washington The question of foreign funding Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad has long captured the ire of officials from Washington and Tel Aviv, and though he s retired, he has channeled his energies into the Perdana Global Peace Foundation, which recently hosted an international conference in Kuala Lumpur calling for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 and has sought to investigate war crimes committed in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan Mahathir has been an ardent critic of Israel and organizations such as AIPAC, and has recently accused US based organizations the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) of holding a concealed intention to influence Malaysia s domestic politics through the funding of local NGOs and groups directly linked to Anwar Ibrahim s Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition In an article the former prime minister published in the New Straits Times, a leading mainstream newspaper, Mahathir accuses financier George Soros and his organization, the Open Society Institute, of promoting democracy  in Eastern Europe to pave the way for colonization by global finance capital Mahathir acknowledges how OSI pumped millions into opposition movements and independent media in Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of strengthening civil society, only to have like minded individuals nominated by Soros s own foundation come to power in those countries The former prime minister has also pointed to how Egypt (prior to Mohamad Morsi taking power) has cracked down on NGOs affiliated with NED, namely groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and Freedom House, which are all recipients of funding from the US State Department In Malaysia, high profile NGOs and media outlets have admittedly received funding from OSI and satellite organizations of NED Premesh Chandran, the CEO of the nation s most prominent alternative media outlet, Malaysiakini, is a grantee of George Soros s Open Society Foundations and launched the news organization with a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok based Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), another organization with dubious affiliations to the US State Department Malaysiakini has come under pressure from local journalists for the lack of transparency in its financial management and hesitance in revealing the value of its shares Additionally, Suaram, an NGO promoting human rights, has borne heavy criticism over its funding and organizational structure The Companies Commission of Malaysia launched investigations into Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd, a private company linked to Suaram, and found it to be a conduit for money being used to channel funds from NED Suaram has been instrumental in legitimizing allegations of a possible cover up of the murder of a Mongolian fashion model, Altantuya Shaaribuu, who was living in Malaysia in 2006 and associated with government officials that have been linked to a kickback scandal involving the government s purchase of submarines from France Senator Ezam Mohd Nor, himself a recipient of Suaram s Human Rights Award, has accused the organization of employing poor research methods and attempting to disparage the government: Malaysians have the right to feel suspicious about them They have been making personal allegations against the Prime Minister [Najib Razak] on the murder of Altantuya and many other cases without proof their motive is very questionable especially when they are more inclined towards ridiculing and belittling the ruling government The German Embassy in KL has reportedly admitted that it has provided funds to Suaram s project in 2010 Malaysia s Foreign Minister Anifah Aman followed by making strong statements to the German Ambassador and declared that Germany s actions could be viewed as interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the Open Society Institute Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton While Sreenevasan s organization claimed to be non partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations Anatomy of Malaysia s political opposition Malaysia is a multi cultural and multi religious state, and both the ruling and opposition parties attempt to represent the nation s three largest ethnic groups Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysians are either ethnic Malay or other indigenous groups and are mostly listed as Muslim, while another 25 per cent are ethnic Chinese who are predominantly Buddhist, with 7 per cent mostly Hindu Indian Malaysians The United Malays National Organization, the Malaysian Chinese Association, and the Malaysian Indian Congress head Barisan Nasional The opposition, Pakatan Rakyat, currently controls four state governments and is led by Anwar Ibrahim s Keadilan Rakyat, the Chinese led Democratic Action Party (DAP), and staunchly Islamist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) While a large percentage of urbanites with legitimate grievances are quick to acknowledge the government s shortcomings, many are hesitant to back Anwar Ibrahim due to his connections with neo conservative thinkers in Washington and general disunity within the opposition   Ibrahim maintains close ties with senior US officials and organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy In 2005, Ibrahim chaired the Washington based Foundation for the Future, established and funded by the US Department of State at the behest of Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of then Vice President Dick Cheney, thanks in large part to his cozy relationship with Paul Wolfowitz While Ibrahim was on trial for allegedly engaging in sodomy with a male aide (of which he was acquitted sometime later), Wolfowitz and former US Vice President Al Gore authored a joint opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in support of Ibrahim, while the Washington Post published an editorial calling for consequences that would affect Malaysia s relations with Washington if Ibrahim was to be found guilty Ibrahim enraged many when he stated that he would support policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview with the Wall Street Journal; this is particularly controversial in Malaysia, where support for Palestine is largely unanimous Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar writes: It is obvious that by acknowledging the primacy of Israeli security, Anwar was sending a clear message to the deep state and to Tel Aviv and Washington that he is someone that they could trust In contrast, the Najib government, in spite of its attempts to get closer to Washington, remains critical of Israeli aggression and intransigence Najib has described the Israeli government as a serial killer and a gangster  Members of Barisan Nasional have addressed Ibrahim s connections to the National Endowment for Democracy in the Malaysian Parliament, including his participation in NED s Democracy Award event held in Washington DC in 2007 Independent journalists have uncovered letters written by Anwar Ibrahim, two of which were sent to NED President Carl Gershman in Washington DC that discussed sending an international election observer team to Malaysia and general issues related to electoral reform A third letter was sent to George Soros, expressing interest in collaborating with an accountability firm headed by Ibrahim Pakatan Rakyat s Communications Director, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, verified the authenticity of the documents This should come as little surprise, as Ibrahim s economic policies have historically aligned with institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, in contrast to Mahathir, whose protectionist economic policies opposed international financial institutions and allowed Malaysia to navigate and largely resurface from the 1997 Asian financial crisis unscathed An issue that concerns secular and non Muslim Malaysian voters is the role of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as part of the opposition In sharp contrast to the moderate brand of Islam preached by UMNO, the organization s primary objective is the founding of an Islamic state The PAS has spoken of working within the framework of Malaysia s parliamentary democracy, but holds steadfast to implementing sharia law on a national scale, which would lead to confusing implications for Malaysia s sizable non Muslim population The debate around the implementation of Islamic hudud penal code is something that other Pakatan Rakyat coalition members, such as figures in the Chinese led Democratic Action Party, have been unable to agree on The PAS enjoys support from rural Malay Muslims in conservative states such as Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu in northern Malaysia, though they have very limited appeal to urbanites While certain individuals in PAS have raised questions about NGOs receiving foreign funding, Mahathir has insinuated that PAS s leadership has been largely complicit: They [foreign interests] want to topple the government through the demonstration and Nik Aziz [Spiritual leader of PAS] said it is permissible to bring down the government in this manner They want to make Malaysia like Egypt, Tunisia, which were brought down through riots and now Syria when the government does not fall, they [Pakatan Rakyat] can appeal to the foreign power to help and bring down, even if it means using fire power  Feasibility of regime change narrative It must be acknowledged that the current administration led by Prime Minister Najib Razak has made great strides toward improving relations with Washington At a meeting with President Barack Obama in 2010, Najib offered Malaysia s assistance to cooperate with the United States to engage the Muslim world; Najib also expressed willingness to deploy Malaysian aid personnel to Afghanistan, and allegedly agreed on the need to maintain a unified front on Iran s nuclear program Najib has employed a Washington based public relations firm, APCO, to improve Malaysia s image in the US and has seemingly embraced American economic leadership of the region through his support for the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement Some would argue that Najib is perhaps the most pro American leader Malaysia has ever had    a stark contrast to the boldness of Mahathir Despite Najib having good rapport with formal Western leaders, it is clear with whom the thank tank policy architects, Zionist lobbies, and foundation fellows have placed their loyalties Sentiment among Malaysia s youth and pro democracy  activists, who constitute a small but vocal minority, tend be entirely dismissive of the regime change narrative, viewing it as pre election diversionary rhetoric of the ruling party While bogeymen of the Zionist variety are often invoked in Malaysian political discourse, it would be negligent to ignore the effects of Washington sponsored democracy promotion in the global context, which have in recent times cloaked mercenary elements and insurgents in the colors of freedom fighting, and successfully masked geopolitical restructuring and the ushering in of neo liberal capitalism with the hip and fashionable vigor of people power coups As the United States continues to militarily increase its presence in the Pacific region in line with its strategic policy shift to East Asia, policy makers in Washington would like to see compliant heads of state who will act to further American interests in the ASEAN region Let s not ignore the elephant in the room; the real purpose of America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify the region as a counterweight against Beijing The defense ministries of Malaysia and China held a landmark defense and security consultation in September 2012, in addition to frequent bilateral state visits and enhanced economic cooperation It was the father of the current leader, Malaysia s second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, who made the landmark visit to Beijing to normalize relations in 1974, and under his son Najib, Sino Malaysian relations and cooperation have never been better Following the global economic crisis of 2008, Najib looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented economy, emphasizing increased Chinese investment into Malaysia and expanding the base of Sino Malaysian trade in areas like education and student exchange, finance, infrastructure development, science and technology, yielding lucrative and mutually beneficial results China has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures reaching US$90 billion in 2011; Malaysia is China s largest trading partner among ASEAN nations In asking the question of regime change in Malaysia, Dr Chandra Muzaffar reflects on Washington s moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the Asia Pacific region: Establishing a military base in Darwin [Australia], resurrecting the US military alliance with the Philippines, coaxing Japan to play a more overt military role in the region, instigating Vietnam to confront China over the Spratly Islands, and encouraging India to counterbalance Chinese power, are all part and parcel of the larger US agenda of encircling and containing China In pursuing this agenda, the US wants reliable allies  not just friends  in Asia In this regard, Malaysia is important because of its position as a littoral state with sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, which is one of China s most critical supply routes that transports much of the oil and other materials vital for its economic development Will the containment of China lead to a situation where the hegemon, determined to perpetuate its dominant power, seek to exercise control over the Straits in order to curb China s ascendancy? Would a trusted ally in Kuala Lumpur facilitate such control? The current Malaysian leadership does not fit the bill  Backwards and forwards Pakatan Rakyat, the main opposition coalition pitted against the ruling party, has yet to offer a fully coherent organizational program, and if the coalition ever came to power, the disunity of its component parties and their inability to agree on fundamental policies would be enough to conjure angrier, disenchanted youth back on to the streets, in larger numbers perhaps What is ticklishly ironic about reading op eds penned by the likes of Wolfowitz and Al Gore, and how they laud Malaysia as a progressive and moderate model Islamic state, is that they concurrently demonize its leadership and dismiss them authoritarian thugs Surely, the ruling coalition has its shortcomings; the politicization of race and religion, noted cases of corrupt officials squandering funds, etc  but far too few, especially those of the middle class who benefit most from energy subsidies, acknowledge the tremendous economic growth achieved under the current leadership and the success of their populist policies Najib s administration would do well to place greater emphasis on addressing the concerns of Malaysia s minorities who view affirmative action policies given to Malay ethnicities as disproportionate; income status, not ethnicity, should be a deciding factor in who receives assistance The current administration appears set to widen populist policies that make necessities affordable through subsidies and continue to assist low income earners with cash handouts Najib has acknowledged the need for broad reforms of Malaysia s state owned enterprises over concerns that crony capitalism may deter foreign investment; this should be rolled out concurrently with programs to foster more local entrepreneurship To put it bluntly, the opposition lacks confidence from the business community and foreign investors; even the likes of JP Morgan have issued statements of concern over an opposition win It should be noted that if Islamists ever wielded greater influence in Malaysia under an opposition coalition, one could imagine a sizable exodus of non Muslim minorities and a subsequent flight of foreign capital, putting the nation s economy in a fragile and fractured state And yet, the United States has poured millions into democracy promotion efforts to strengthen the influence of NGOs that distort realities and cast doubt over the government s ability to be a coherent actor Malaysia does not have the kind of instability that warrants overt external intervention; backing regime change efforts may only go so far as supporting dissidents and groups affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim No matter the result of the upcoming elections, Najib appears to have played ball enough for Washington to remain more or less neutral According to Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, Malaysia s electoral process is so restrictive that a mass movement like Bersih is required to purge the system of its backwardness These are curious statements, considering that the opposition gained control of four out of 13 states in 2008, including Selangor, a key economic state with the highest GDP and most developed infrastructure In response, Najib has adhered to Bersih s demands and has called for electoral reform, forming a parliamentary select committee comprising members from both Pakatan Rakyat and Barisan Nasional As elections loom, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenavasan is already dubbing them the dirtiest elections ever seen   unsurprising rhetoric from a woman being handed her talking points by the US embassy Nile Bowie for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-regime-change-871/

Or is it because the prosecutors could not be bothered to go through all that hassle to actually face the omnipotent financial system?KH: There re two great disappointments with President Obama One is that the banks were not held accountable for the crisis RT:And they should have been?KH: They should have been held accountable However, this piece of legislation the President Obama put forward called Dodd Frank, it s not very strong, partly because the banks lobbied against it and neutered it But that is a disappointment, the banks should have been held accountable, at least there should have been demands put on the banks However, there are prosecutors in America, e g the Attorney General of New York, who started civil suits, lawsuits against some of the big banks because of their fraud in the mortgage crisis, which is at the heart of financial crisis You know, it s crazy, because in America right now our oligarchs, our financial class, our business people, particularly Wall Street, are angry with Obama, when in fact he, like Franklin Roosevelt, saved the banks He saved them from the excesses of capitalism RT: Why are they angry with him?KH: Because once or twice he called them fat cats , because he said a few bad things about them Their feelings are hurt But I think, more than that, there s a level of greed and arrogance among Wall Street now that they don t feel that they should be touched, that they should be regulated And that s why Mitt Romney has become the candidate of Wall Street That s not to say President Obama is not getting money from Wall Street, but most of the big bankers are supporting Mitt Romney because they see him as an investment As an investment, and if they put a lot of money in him it s still a good investment on return because he will lower their taxes, deregulate and repeal Dodd Frank legislation RT:Well, I don t really get why, because inequality gap  is like a buzzword right now in the US media There are estimates showing that in the last 20 years, by the way, with Republicans and Democrats equally, the real income of the top 1 per cent has been growing nine times faster than the real income of the lower 99 per cent KH: I mean, the inequality gap, which President Obama does speak about, partly because of Occupy Wall Street and the 99 per cent movement which pushed him to speak about the greed and the recklessness of Wall Street and the inequality RT:But is it an overrated issue, the inequality gap?KH: No, and it s a terrible issue and you re right that it has grown not only just under Republicans, but under Democrats, it is a bipartisan issue Over this last 40 years worker s wages have stagnated, and in the last two years 93 per cent of the income growth has gone to the top 1 per cent This is a scandal, this is obscenity But what s also important, it is not only the revival of the middle class, which is under terrible stress, because to me it is the source of the healthy economy and country But also what s been scandalous in this election is what has not been talked about You rarely hear about the poor: 15 per cent poverty in America today, one of the richest countries in the world One in six children You don t hear about climate change or climate crisis And you don t hear about the militarization of our foreign policy RT:Well, you mentioned oligarchs who put so much money in American politics and right before that you ve mentioned the poor, who haven t really been discussed in these elections You see, for people who aren t American it s always been strange to look at how all these corporations, big companies are giving millions of dollars in donations to the presidential candidates Because it really makes you wonder, how can you after that get a president who will actually stand for the interest of the poor or even the middle class?KH: There s a great battle underway to try and get money out of politics, or to make sure that the system is such that the 99 per cent give small money and the 1 per cent is all restricted from all of this big money President Obama has received millions of dollars, but it is the case that he and his party, the Democratic Party, have now said that, if elected, they will implement reforms like overturning Citizens United or clean money , so you reduce the big money in the system, whereas the Republican Party has obstructed or blocked any reform of such kind They want to keep big money in the system So there is a difference And I would say that a recovery program that President Obama implemented had the largest share of anti poverty money since the Great Society of 1965, which was when the war on poverty in America was at its height RT:Do you think Obama was able to capitalize on the Occupy Wall Street movement?KH: I think Occupy Wall Street had a great impact on American political scene and on the President Did he capitalize on it? I think the reverse I think Occupy Wall Street pushed President Obama to speak in new ways, that he didn t before, about inequality, about fairness, about the recklessness and irresponsibility of greed in America RT:Who do you think these people will vote for?KH: Occupy?RT: Yes, because there s another survey that says 81 per cent of Americans believe the government has not done enough to stop corporate wrongdoings KH: Occupy, as you know, it was more a moral protest Many of them, in Occupy, I think will not vote RT: I want to touch a little bit on foreign policy, and I know that the candidates haven t focused on it too much That s probably because you have so many economic and domestic problems to focus on But every time an American president is elected it affects the rest of the world And let me tell you how we see it at this point: we just wonder does it really matter if it s a Republican or a Democrat, because we ve seen every single president, let s start with Clinton, let s start with Yugoslavia, go and start a war in a different region And even Obama, who got the Nobel Peace prize you know, we see Afghanistan, Iraq, is not quite finished yet, we see drones killing people on the Pakistani border Does it really make a difference for the outside world, whether a Republican or a Democrat wins? Because Libya also, a possible intervention in Iran and Syria KH: I think it makes a difference If President Obama is re elected, I wish it would make much more of a difference, I think these similarities between the two parties are major, particularly the establishment of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party Our country deserves better in terms of a different foreign policy Less militarized, more in terms of seeking political solutions to conflict But President Obama has ended the war in Iraq Mitt Romney says he would ve kept troops in Iraq President Obama is beginning to end the war in Afghanistan and I think there would be a battle around that And if Mitt Romney becomes President he may well stay there On Iran, I think Mitt Romney is much more likely to side with the right wing of his new government in terms of military strikes in the region, which would be a disaster, even according to former heads of Shin Bet and Mossad And I think in terms of Russia the relations are not good, but they would be worse under Mitt Romney, who by the way led Republicans on imposing arms control agreements, which Republicans for the last three decades have supported I think in terms of Libya [sic], I wish there was more difference, but the Republicans want to arm the rebels So I think on a whole series of issues I wish there was more difference Mitt Romney has around him a lot of advisers who took us into the disaster of Iraq, the neo conservatives He has some realists, but the neo conservatives could well win out And I think President Obama could be pushed in ways Romney could not be I think the escalation of the drone war is something the nation continues to speak out against It is very dangerous, morally wrong, destabilizing and will lead to a backlash And of course the counter terrorism policies are for the most part the continuation of the Bush policies, which is tragic Because I think President Obama wants to find a way on this war on terror, but while we re still in it, it is very tough to talk in a different way, because Americans RT: It is such an abstract war, it doesn t really seem like KH: Well, it shouldn t be a war, you know very well To fight a terror it should not be a war You cannot fight a military war against a tactic   you have to find political and other ways to deal with it And the more we fight it in military ways in America, the more we create more militants and anger and backlash against America So I think part of what s going on is also a global economic picture I think Mitt Romney would be worse, I think he would bring to America what we see in Europe His program is Austerity Light  and if it starts slashing spending and tax cuts for the rich, you could see something comparable to the disaster we see in Greece, in Spain, in Italy And that, I think, is very frightening Whereas Obama, I think, would continue to try and inject some stimulus into the American economy RT:Right, let the best one win Katrina vanden Heuvel, thank you very much for this interview RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/katrina-vanden-heuvel-interview-850/
"1 Nov, 2012",âYes we Khanâ: US applies drone diplomacy at Toronto Airport (Op-Ed),"One story, overshadowed by Hurricane Sandy, the Obama Romney race and Syria s civil war, nevertheless, tells a lot of who s who in today s world It is the story of who is setting the rules of the game and drawing the world s new divisive lines to supplement the old barricades Here it is for you It involves a living legend of Pakistani cricket, largely seen as the country s next prime minister or president, sportsman turned politician Imran Khan Khan was flying from Ottawa to New York to attend a key fundraising event after collecting money in Canada for the nearing elections in Pakistan when he was removed from the plane to be questioned by US immigration authorities last Friday You may ask, why? Well, the detention could be hardly explained by the vague language of a terse statement on the issue, made by the US State Department s Spokesperson Laura Lucas The explanation sounds confusing: We are aware that Imran Khan had been briefly delayed in Toronto before boarding the next flight to United States The issue was resolved Mr Imran is welcome in the United States  In a later statement, State Department spokesman Mark Toner denied that Khan was held and interrogated in Toronto Anyway, was it really such a bizarre form of welcome ? Or was it rather a cold shower? What is crystal clear is that Khan s abrupt offloading at Toronto Airport had nothing to do with security or other reasons which should have prompted US immigration authorities to act in such a weird way, as if catapulting a Pakistani celebrity from the plane No alleged terrorist connection or serious crime, nor any wrongdoing was reported All in all, as a result of the incident the humiliated the leader of Pakistan s Tehreek e Insaf party had to take another flight to New York and missed the fundraising lunch and subsequent events, which, in fact, were on the priority list of his four day visit to US, which ended this week What shed some light on the incident was a comment, left on Twitter by Khan himself Describing his US trip perils, the Pakistani politician confessed he was interrogated on [his] views on drones  My stance is known Drone attacks must stop While not trying to hide his disappointment, Imran Khan made himself clear that it is prudent to stand by one s views Missed flight and sad to miss the fundraising lunch in NY, but nothing will change my stance, he wrote Just imagine what could have happened, if eventually a visiting US senator was detected in a Pakistani airport and taken off his plane to be interrogated, say, on continuous airstrikes in Pakistan, denounced by Islamabad However, as an old Latin adage goes, Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi  [What is legitimate for Jove is not legitimate for oxen Ed ] Two millennia after the Romans some things actually haven t changed Might is right the same way it happened in the time of Roman wars No need to say that every time they take to the global skies US and Pakistani politicians would be respectively treated as VIP and coach class passengers, with one enjoying de facto immunity, not written into any Geneva convention, while the other being deprived of it What strike me most of all in the Imran Khan story is not even the notorious double standards shown again the reality, all of us in the global village seemingly got used to long ago While navigating the web I discovered something that until last week I actually didn t know As it turns out, Khan was far from being the only Pakistani dignitary punished by the Obama administration in a carefully veiled move through introducing US entry restrictions or a visa curtain for taking the risk of striking a critical note on White House foreign and security policy It is reported that some weeks earlier, Shahzad Akbar, a prominent Pakistani lawyer who represents drone victims in lawsuits against the US and is also known as the co founder of the Pakistani human rights organization Foundation for Fundamental Rights, was denied a US entry visa while planning to address an international conference in Washington In another incident, dated back to this May, Mohammad Danish Qasim, a Pakistani student, who produced a short film titled The Other Side, which revolves around the idea of assessing social, psychological and economical effects of drones on the people in tribal areas of Pakistan  was twice denied a US entry visa and never reached US shores Ironically, Qasim was chosen as the winner of the Audience Award for Best International Film at the 2012 National Film Festival For Talented Youth, held annually in the US But let us get back to the Imran Khan story What makes this most ironic is that the US loves to sermonize to the world about the need for open ideas and political debate In April, the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, had lectured the planet on how those societies that believe they can be closed to change, to ideas, cultures and beliefs that are different from theirs, will find quickly that in our internet world they will be left behind,  writes Glenn Greenwald in a story carried by The Nation Pakistani leading daily According to the author, Clinton s remarks raise eyebrows as she is part of the same government that seeks to punish and exclude filmmakers, students, lawyers, activists and politicians for the crime of opposing US policy Isn t it a major paradox that while all dictionaries describe the freedom of movement as one of the basic human freedoms and ABC of free market society (along with the free flow of ideas and capital), in present day realities it becomes more a freedom with a price tag attached to it  So, if you are not ready to compromise your views, be ready to be detected in Toronto Airport while en route to the US or somewhere else, as happened with Imran Khan and the others You will find no way to escape from the welcome drones of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner s diplomacy Sergey Strokan, for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/khan-us-toronto-sandy-774/
"6 Oct, 2012",Venezuelan elections: Itâs either ChÃ¡vez or Washington! (Op-Ed),"This Sunday s elections will pit incumbent President Hugo Chavez FrÃ­as against neoliberal pro US opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski Opinion polls vary widely both ways, proof it will be a head to head race This election is not only of vital importance to Venezuela, but to all of Latin America, as Chavez has been a veritable barrier against traditional US interventionism in the region Get Chavez! That s been the rallying call in the mainstream Western media, demonizing Chavez s refusal to align Venezuela to the Western powers geopolitical objectives throughout the world, something the US and its allies find very hard to swallow That s why they ve put all their clout behind young up start Henrique Capriles Radonski, as if he were a savior of democracy in Venezuela  But that s not quite the case when you consider that Capriles Radonski was very much involved in the failed US backed coup in April 2002 to oust Chavez, and even spent a short spate in jail for it Chavez, in turn, is presented as authoritarian and not democratic    And yet, when he lost the 2007 constitutional reform referendum or the 2010 congressional elections, his government fully heeded the electorate s will   No one today doubts that Sunday s elections will be transparent and fair So why all the anger and fuss against Chavez?  To those who haven t got the message yet: It s his foreign policy, Stupid!   Irrespective of whether his domestic policies are good or bad, his foreign policies have held Venezuela s sovereignty and self esteem very high indeed, actively supporting all nations being savagely attacked by the US, UK, NATO or Israel Such is Venezuela s support of the martyred peoples of Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, all flagrantly bombed, invaded and devastated by the Western powers based on outright lies, perverted distortions of the truth, and corporate greed to grab oil resources Today, the West targets Syria engineering internal strife and civil war as they already did in Iraq, Libya and other Muslim countries: in Orwellian Newspeak, the Arab Spring  They also threaten Iran with unilateral military attack and commit murder, sabotage and financial manipulation inside Iranian territory whilst spreading all sorts of global media lies Israel Ãber Alles!! It must be said: at the center of the We Hate Chavez  movement is Israel, for here lies one of the clues to the sudden rise of Capriles Radonski  Israel and the global Zionist Movement would love to greet him as Venezuela s new president, and not just because he is Jewish on both his mother s and father s side   a rather surprising fact in a country of almost 30 million people, that has an extremely tiny Jewish community of 12,000 (0 03 per cent of the total population!!) The real issue lies in the fact that he would join the global support Israel at any cost movement, in line with what already occurs in the US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and even in Latin American countries like Mexico, Chile and even Argentina Here we must pause and make sure we don t confuse politics with religion: not all Jews are Zionists; not all Zionists are Jews, Zionism being a fundamentalist political ideology of global reach and huge political and financial clout, whose militants come from a variety of religious faiths  No one better than the United States Roman Catholic Vice President Joe Biden who, on April 7, 2007, declared on Israel s ShalomTV You don t have to be Jewish to be Zionist   I m a Zionist!  Fine! So, yes, Capriles Radonski is in that same camp which is why Zionist media and money are staunchly supporting him For they will never forgive Chavez s hosting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Caracas, rendering him international political support in his fight against threats, aggression and the murder of his country s politicians and scientists committed by CIA and Israeli Mossad assassins They will never forgive Chavez s support for Libya s Muammar Gaddafi, murdered on live TV by NATO backed thugs to the boisterous laughter of Hilary Clinton They will never forgive Chavez s support for the legitimate government of Syria in its fight against local and foreign terrorists financed, armed and trained by the US, Israel and UK, as openly stated by US Senator John McCain  They will never forgive Chavez s influence in Latin America, which inspired other countries to take an independent stance towards Iran, as the cases of Bolivia, Ecuador; even Brazil and Argentina show Clearly, Henrique Capriles Radonski is the absolute favorite of the US and its allies, and of the Zionist organizations and lobbies that reign over them The real goal: Conquer Venezuela! Whilst their very short term goal is to defeat Hugo Chavez; the medium term goal is to defeat Venezuela and, further ahead, their long term goal is to defeat all of Latin America If Venezuela falls into the hands of Capriles Radonski and the Global Power Masters supporting him, he will then join forces with Colombia, whose pro US President Juan Manuel Santos is a member of David Rockefellers Americas Society  and its mega bankers He will join forces with pro US/UK regimes as PeÃ±a Nieto s in MÃ©xico and PiÃ±era s in Chile A defeated Venezuela would become subordinate to the goals and objectives of the US and its partners, who are planning and starting to implement a Latin American Spring   Capriles Radonski would become a milestone in such a Spring  which, like its Arab counterpart, promotes Western powers hegemony over the entire region, promoting regime change  in countries not fully aligned to them, their multinational corporations natural resources appetites, and their mega bankers greed  Engineering social uprisings and civil wars is what Democracy Made in USA  is now all about By the way, it s no coincidence that this long planned on going process is now guaranteed by the powerful US Fourth South Atlantic Fleet, which Baby Bush reactivated in 2008 after it had been scrapped almost half a century ago  Hugo Chavez understands this very well; so does Brazil, which is actively strengthening and modernizing is air and naval military forces   Only misgoverned and mismanaged countries like Argentina under Cristina Kirchner look the other way whilst all of this takes place right under their noses But that s the kind of regime that Democracy Made in USA  promotes in countries like Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Honduras and Panama That s the role that presidents like Kirchner, Menem, Uribe, Santos, CalderÃ³n and Zedillo are there to play: keeping their peoples ignorant and dumbed down, throwing the ghastly masses of the poor a bone every now and then, whilst they and friends  are all busy getting rich through corruption and embezzlement  Most importantly, they always, always lend a willing ear to whatever messages emanate from The Embassy  (of the US, or Israel, or the UK of course!)Regarding Chavez s health, boy oh boy how Washington, London and Tel Aviv would have loved for his cancer to take him out!!Time and again Reuters, Fox News and The New York Times practically had him dead and buried, and yet the good doctors and treatment over in Cuba brought Chavez back to health   Maybe it s because Merck, Abbott, Glaxo and the others are NOT in Havana? Poor Cuba: yet another country under decades of attack from Big Brother to the north Naturally, there s still much to be done to improve social conditions in Venezuela; of course mistakes have been made, but above all Hugo Chavez has held up Venezuela s honor and dignity and, by extension, that of Latin America as a whole, against common adversaries to the north Lucid, awakened and honorable Venezuelans know this but, as with all countries, there is also a massive deadweight of the population that will vote with their wallets , only catering to their own personal interests, whilst caring little or nothing for the common good Of the latter, Argentine President Juan Domingo PerÃ³n once said that their most sensitive organ is their pocket ¦ Let s hope a majority of Venezuelans will be inspired to vote with a strong heart and a clear mind Adrian Salbuchi for RT Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and radio/TV commentator in Argentina www asalbuchi com ar RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/venezuela-elections-chavez-washington-816/
"26 Sep, 2012",âWest miscalculated the potential of Arab World angerâ,"The recent wave of anti US protests is a wakeup call to Western governments that the Arab World will not tolerate outside attempts to shape the Arab Awakening  to foreign benefit, diplomat and former spy Alastair Crooke told RT In his thirty years of British government service, Alistair Crooke has operated in trouble spots all across the globe from helping the Mujahadeen fighters in Afghanistan against the Soviets, to working with rebel political groups in Northern Ireland, Cambodia and Colombia As a former EU special envoy to the Middle East, he has brokered a number of ceasefires between Israel and the Palestinian movements, Fatah and Hamas He now serves as the director of the conflicts forum in Beirut, where RT sat down with him for an exclusive interview RT: Well, is the wave of recent violence, the anti American wave of protests across the Middle East   do you see that as a coordinated effort or perhaps just a reaction to what s going on on the ground?Alistair Crooke: It seems to me that what happened in Libya was well planned and well conceived I mean very well planned, and was certainly not something that happened just out of the blue And it coincided, of course, with the anniversary of 9/11, and seems to have been more serious I don t think that necessarily suggests that everything else that has that occurred during this period was therefore coordinated or well designed or well planned What it did touch was a real latent sense of anger at what people see as the continuing aggression (as they see it) against their traditions, against their culture, against their way of being in this region by western states The recent events, the sudden outbreak of Salafist violence in Libya itself, in Benghazi, the very seat of what America saw as the new era emerging This outbreak will cause the West cumulatively to begin to question and start the process which they need to do, which is really to reassess what actually is going on It s not the awakening that people thought It s not simply a popular impulse of the oppressed against the oppressors It s far more than that, and what we are seeing is the overlay of the dynamics Here it is that Gulf States Saudi Arabia and Qatar and other Gulf States that are trying to create a Sunni block in the western lands of Islam, as they try to create a Salafist Sunni block in the eastern lands and have succeeded Now it s the turn of Syria And it s causing huge turmoil, and huge internal conflict within the region RT: Well, referring to the killing of the US Ambassador in Libya, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has remarked, how could this happen in a country that we helped liberate?  What are the US foreign policy makers missing when it comes to their support or interfering in countries with a complicated stance toward the West?AC: Indeed I think it is causing a real sense of anxiety and a sense of shock in the US widely, because this whole narrative that somehow the awakening was going our way was reflecting and you know much of that was simply based on this rather facile narrative promoted by the mainstream western press saying: look they re using Twitter and Facebook and therefore it must be western in its orientation Well, look, of course you find the Salafist groups are using Twitter and Facebook, but not necessarily to promote western values But I think that gave it the sense that somehow this is flowing in the West s direction and it should be a big wakeup call to western states For the moment we see a tacit, if you like, alliance between these radical elements and the United States in bringing down Assad and bringing down Gaddafi But when that s finished, where will their anger turn? Where will their objective turn? It will turn precisely on Israel and America again The West is living I ve seen for 25 years people think they re using the Salafists as simple pious people who don t understand politics to their end only to find the Salafists use them for their end And I fear that this is happening They will find that it will turn on them and will bite them just as it did 25 30 years ago RT: Well what lessons has the US failed to learn when it comes to its experience in Afghanistan? And how does that relate to what s going on right now?AC: Well, I remember in 1987 going and talking to the Americans about it and saying, you know, you need to really understand that there re big differences between these groups that are taking part in this alliance that you ve put together, and you have to understand some have credibility and real roots within the community but others do not at all   they re quite different And the Americans and a senator   I remember at the time turned to me and said: Listen Alastair Thank you for the advice in warning us about certain groups in Afghanistan, but look I just want to tell you, they re the ones who really kick communist ass And so we looked away, we didn t want to know what was happening We preferred not to look because it was so popular domestically with President Reagan, with Mrs Thatcher It was going down well Now we re in the era where we re kicking Gaddafi s ass We re kicking President Assad s ass it s a popular sport in the west And good domestically So we don t look Who are these groups in Syria? Who were the groups in Libya? What really are their objectives? Are their objectives truly to bring about as some in the west imagine a simply more liberal society, a more democratic and easy breathing society? Of course not Just as 25 30 years ago people didn t want to hear, it was unpopular to say these things, so it s been extremely unpopular here RT:So are you saying that the West miscalculated, chose the wrong alliances perhaps?AC: I think that they miscalculate totally what was happening They chose, they created a narrative for themselves It was a constructive narrative, that really all of this in the initial awakening   which was popular and had real popular impulse in it   was a somehow vindication of European values, of American values And they misread this totally it was not It was in fact and you heard this it was a protest against injustice and inequity It was a protest against neoliberalism It was a protest against the absolute support by the west for Israel and its policies against the Palestinians That may not have been at the forefront of all of the clamor, but the reason that these dictators like Mubarak had been so unpopular, was precisely because he was the instrument of the West, the instrument of suppression of the Palestinians And that s what always lay behind the protests that took place so it was not an endorsement of Western values, it was a reaction And I think the recent violence that we ve seen, against western embassies not just Americans, western sharply underlines symbolically the limits of western influence in the region This is pushback against their attempt to shape and mold the so called Arab Awakening for their own purpose To install their own people, their own successors, for their own interests in this area RT: Well, when it comes to Syria how do you see the conflict there playing out? Is peace at all possible at this point or have we surpassed that opportunity?AC: I don t think until now we ve had a window, There s not really been real window for negotiations because the West has not wanted the opposition to seriously negotiate except on a complete collapse of president Assad and the Syrian system I think there may be a window arising in the near future and I do hope that the West will instead of ridiculing and belittling Russia s attempts to try and have a negotiated outcome they instead support it Because Russia plays a crucial role If there is ever to be a negotiation between the two parties, there will have to be guarantees, for the opposition And who is going to give the guarantees? The UN? Absolutely not The West? Turkey? Of course not Only Russia can really play the crucial role in resulting I m sorry but a UN negotiator, the UN has no standing or real legitimacy in Syria among either side at this time RT: And are you worried about the ongoing violence in Syria spilling over here into Lebanon and potentially fracturing the society here?AC: Of course Everyone is worried and it already has had effect here in Lebanon It has polarized the politics of Lebanon It has resulted in conflicts that have taken place in Tripoli It has resulted in skirmishes that have happened in Beirut, and in the south in Sidon we see reflections of this taking place And Lebanon is, of course, vulnerable to this type of sectarian conflict But so is Jordan, so is Iraq And we are seeing the same effects also taking place So it is affecting the whole region And if it continues, and of course if the money and the weapons continue to be poured into Syria, it will of course continue for a certain extent No government can stop two or three people and car bombs If it does continue, the tensions will increase, but they may explode outside Syria In fact, I think in many cases at this stage, it s the states outside that are more vulnerable the neighbors of Syria that could be said to be more vulnerable than Syria itself to conflagration and to civil war RT: Well, Israel remains surprisingly untouched it would seem at least on the surface by the rise of radical Islam Do you expect that to continue, and how do you see this playing out?AC: I think at the moment that it s quite true, that the Palestinian issue is almost obscured hardly even on the agenda But of course, I don t believe that this will persist I believe that the Palestinian issue has been so crucial to the self identity of so many states whether it s Egypt, whether it s Syria itself that when things settle down, the Palestinian issue will of course re emerge And of course, Israel is not unaffected; it may not be feeling the effects now, but look What s happened has been as dramatic a change as South Africa experienced all those years ago, at the time of the implosion of the Soviet Union Suddenly, Israel is now surrounded, in Egypt, and perhaps soon in Jordan and elsewhere, by a very different region from the one in which it previously existed RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/alistair-crooke-exclusive-interview-973/
"20 Sep, 2012",Putin agrees: USAID meddling in Russian politics,"President Vladimir Putin shares the opinion of the Foreign Ministry that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is engaged in more than just humanitarian work in Russia Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich on Wednesday said Russia decided to order the closure of the USAID office after concluding it provided funds for non government organizations that seek to influence the political process, including elections at various levels and civil society President Putin has an identical position on the question of the US agency s political activities in Russia, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday The Moscow office of USAID has until October 1, 2012 to comply with the Russian government s request The decision, coming at the height of the US presidential election season, has attracted heated criticism from both US Democrats and Republicans, who are politicizing every new development in an effort to win the White House in November In a telling article in The Washington Post on Thursday, USAID s humanitarian work the organization has spent around $2 7 billion in Russia over the last 20 years   was barely mentioned Instead, the bulk of the missive was devoted to vilifying the Russian President A clear condemnation of Putin s actions is necessary out of principle and to show support to those brave Russians who are fed up with authorities rampant corruption, abuses and heavy handed tactics,  wrote David J Kramer, president of Freedom House The U S government should make clear that support remains unchanged for Russian non governmental organizations (NGOs) Aside from failing to mention that Putin enjoys high popularity ratings, and that the protests are a marginal phenomenon at best, the author chastised Russia over its new foreign agents  law, which requires Russian NGOs to disclose how they are using funds received from abroad Nowhere in the Washington Post article is it mentioned, however, that the United States has had its own foreign agents act  (FARA) since 1938 According to the US Department of Justice website; FARA requires persons acting as agents of foreign principals in a political or quasi political capacity to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities Disclosure of the required information facilitates evaluation by the government in light of their function as foreign agents Since Russia is not funding election monitoring organizations on the territory of the United States, as USAID did with the Russian based Golos, there remained the nagging suspicion that Russian NGOs were being used as a political tool to turn the screws on Russia s political machinery This suspicion only increased following last year s protests, which President Putin blamed on US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Putin said Clinton gave them a signal, they heard this signal and started active work Now, diplomats are working overtime to smooth over the issue before it gets out of hand Hopefully, a mutually acceptable formula (concerning the foreign funding of NGOs) will be found during meetings of our foreign political departments I stand for equal representation, Russian Human Rights envoy Vladimir Lukin told Interfax on Thursday Lukin then noted that USAID is a component of the US Department of State, and the way the U S Department of State is represented in Russia and the way the Russian Foreign Ministry is represented in the US is a matter of agreements and negotiations between the countries at large In an interview with RT, Sergey Markov, political analyst and member of the Public Chamber, supported Lukin s statement, while taking it a step further Structures like USAID should definitely function not only in Russia, but similar Russian organizations should operate in the United States, Markov stressed Our problem is not that the Americans allow us, but because the Russian political elite underestimate the role of soft power in today s political environment The political analyst noted that as a result of this attitude, Russia still hasn t created an organization similar to USAID that works abroad,  lamenting that the total budget of all comparable Russian bodies is less than that of USAID  Such an organization could and should actively work in the post Soviet space, he added Markov then took to task the notion, regularly recycled in the Western media, that Russia has a totalitarian political system Russia s political system is open and competitive and that makes it possible to influence it via various political parties and non governmental organizations,  Markov told RT If the Russian political system was really authoritarian, if it was some sort of dictatorship, there would be no sense to even try to affect it, but since its open various forces are constantly trying to manipulate it Meanwhile, Russia says it has no plans to revise its decision to close the US mission office as of October 1, Lukashevich told reporters Our position is that a decision has been made and that being a decision made by a sovereign state, it must be fully implemented, the diplomat said We have been assured by our American colleagues that the request will be fulfilled, he added RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/putin-usaid-russia-washington-moscow-557/
"11 Sep, 2012","US embassies in Cairo, Benghazi targeted over on-screen âinsultsâ to Islam (VIDEO)","A US official was killed as an armed mob attacked the US Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi The attack came hours after protesters stormed the US Embassy in Cairo in indignation over an American film they say insulted the Prophet Muhammad One American official was killed and another injured in the hand,  Libya s Deputy Interior Minister Wanis al Sharef told AFP The other staff members were evacuated and are safe and sound Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has confirmed that one official from her agency was killed in the attack The Benghazi attackers set fire to the building, according to witness reports, who say much of the consulate was burned There were reports of fierce gunfights between the attackers and Libyan security forces Rocket propelled grenades were fired at the consulate from a nearby farm, said Abdel Monem Al Hurr, a spokesman for the Libyan Interior Ministry s security commission The Libyan security forces came under heavy fire, and we were not prepared for the intensity of the attack, Hurr said At least three members of the security forces were taken away in an ambulance, Reuters reported State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland strongly condemned the attack on the US diplomatic mission Earlier, over 2,000 protesters stormed the US Embassy in Cairo in neighboring Egypt, some of them removing the American flag and trying to replace it with a black flag reading There is no God but Allah This was the first time ever that the US embassy in Egypt had been attacked or breached The film that is believed to have triggered the uprisings was produced by a US based group that includes Terry Jones, a Christian pastor involved in a Koran burning scandal that triggered mass protests in Afghanistan On the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, he released a video promoting the film that portrays the Prophet in a satirical manner, according to Jones The embassy in Cairo, in a statement, condemned the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions This movie must be banned immediately and an apology should be made this is a disgrace, one of the Egyptian activists told Reuters, calling on President Mohamed Morsi to take action Ahmed Ben Helli, the Arab League deputy secretary general, has also condemned the film, saying it contained insults against the Prophet Mohammed and was denounced by Christians and Muslims across the Arab world Extreme elements reinforcing each other Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic Politics at the University of Denver, told RT that such protests could spread through the entire Arab world, as there is no shortage of extreme groups the same applies to the US that would love to co opt the incident for their own cause RT: The protests escalated into attacks on the US diplomatic missions at a breakneck pace Are you surprised at this, and what does this say about pent up anger at America in the region?Nader Hashemi: I am surprised largely because no one has ever heard about this controversial film All of a sudden we are told that it s a cause for deep concern that it is in production It s led to a protest in Egypt and in Libya, but I think that it is important not to exaggerate the scale of the protest This is not Egyptian society boiling over, this is a very small group of extremists about 15 hundred who attacked the US embassy What we have here is, you know, the extreme elements both in the United States and in Egypt mutually reinforcing one another RT: Terry Jones, the Florida pastor who burned the Koran earlier, has promoted the film Is this a specific case of some Americans spreading anti Islamic sentiment, or does it represent the general attitude in America towards the Muslim world these days?NH: No, this is an extreme lunatic fringe of the American religious spectrum When Terry Jones began burning the Koran on his front lawn in Florida, he was widely condemned by most decent people But you know, people like this, I think are looking for a reaction they are looking for precisely what we saw today in Cairo and in Benghazi They deeply are trying to promote a clash of civilizations And thankfully both groups both in Egypt and the US are in a minority, in an extreme minority, and let s hope it stays there RT: Given what we ve seen so far, do you expect much more fallout from this?NH: Well, it remains to be seen What disturbs me is that this is a film no one knew anything about Now it has generated into protests the fear of this spreading to other countries There are groups such as we saw today in Egypt and in Libya that thrive on this type of controversy They want to gain publicity for their own cause by turning an incident such as this into a major international issue So yes, there is fear that we are going to see copycats of demonstrations throughout the Arab and Muslim world And let s hope that cooler heads can prevail Screenings canceled for security reasons Meanwhile, British Channel 4 has called off another controversial documentary questioning the origins of Islam, citing security concerns Islam: The Untold Story, which claims that there is little contemporary evidence of the origins of Islam, drew over 1,000 complains after it was screened two weeks ago Having taken security advice we have reluctantly cancelled a planned screening of the program, Islam: The Untold Story We remain

"9 Aug, 2012",âNo player takes opinion of Syrian people into accountâ,"The escalating militarization of the Syrian conflict only favors foreign players interests, claims Phyllis Bennis, director of the New Internationalism Project at the Institute of Policy Studies, and an activist on the Middle East The US political activist insists that Syria has become a battle ground in a power struggle in UN between the US and Russia, between NATO and the Gulf States on the one hand and other Arab states on the other  Almost none of the players are taking into account the interests of the people of Syria,  she noted Bennis, who is also a fellow of the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, believes the situation in Syria differs a lot from that one in Libya, because Syria has never witnessed sectarian violence If sectarian violence in Syria explodes it would spill over the borders, she told RT RT: The Red Cross and other experts are saying the situation in Syria has descended into full scale civil war How does that affect the positions of the US, the positions of the West versus the position of other countries?Phyllis Bennis: So far we have seen no indication that either the US or any of the outside actors are taking seriously the consequences of the determination by the International Committee of the Red Cross that it is a full scale civil war What it means, among other things, is that the international laws of war what s known as international humanitarian law applied throughout the region and it applies to the opposition as well as to the regime They are obligated under the conditions of international law not to use certain kinds of weapons, not to attack civilians, not to hold prisoners without some kind of process All of those things are part of international humanitarian law and we have seen no evidence yet that any of the outside actors are taking any of that seriously RT: What does that mean to the Syrian conflict?PB: What it means for the Syrian people is that the militarization of this conflict is escalating That can only be in my view dangerous, more dangerous The notion that there can be a transition a regime that would not have the same kind of repression that we have seen from Assad all these years is still possible   a fact that Hillary Clinton is now reduced to acknowledging That if Assad himself arranges a transition safe haven   whether it s in Moscow, whether it s in Saudi Arabia or somewhere else   that s still possible Then the question becomes, who is going to be in control, if the escalation continues, if the militarization continues, what we would then see is that the post Assad government will be led by the men with guns RT: Just like when we saw in Libya, just like when we saw in Somalia and many other places PB: I don t want to make comparisons Libya is a very different country than Syria, Somalia is a very different country, but the notion that the victors of a political struggle because this is still a political struggle in Syria When the victors are those with the guns that always bolds ill for women, for children, for civilians Syria is not Libya Syria has a long history of civil society mobilization and organizations They have many things that were not possible in Libya It s not the same I don t want to equate them, but the danger is that you will have certain parallels, certain similarities such as unaccountable militias who will not put themselves under the accountability of a new government That is a very dangerous reality and as diplomats have already acknowledged if there is another bigger explosion in Syria, if the entire Syrian body politic explodes, it will be an explosion not an implosion as Libya was There is the danger because it is becoming sectarian, because of that sectarian character that is only now becoming dominant in Syria In a country that was not traditionally a sectarian divided religiously divided country, despite the use by the regime of religious and sectarian divisions to maintain its power, this was not a population that identified primarily by their religious affiliation as Sunni or Shia or Alawi or whatever It was a possibility that if you were an Alawi you had a better shot at power But it was not the way people defined themselves The danger of course is that with that growing, the sectarianism growing, there is the danger that it will spill over the borders RT: And some congressmen and senators calls to arm the rebels, for the West to intervene, don t you think that s just going to make it worse?PB: Any further intervention by further militarization is going to make things worse The original militarization has made things far more difficult Further militarization is going to kill more civilians The choice of the Syrian opposition to take up arms was contested from the beginning by other parts of the Syrian resistance who said that we have a better chance of changing over government, of overthrowing the government by non violent methods So certainly more escalation, whether it s by the US or some other outside power, is going to be very dangerous RT: Experts now say that the rebels in Syria are very much dominated by Al Qaeda PB: There is an interest in the US, for instance, of downplaying the role of the Islamists, but it s become more apparent that there are Islamist forces Whether they are Al Qaeda I think there is no much evidence yet I think that it is very dangerous for outside actors who were not on the ground, who don t necessarily have good sources on the ground, to assume that any Islamist forces of resistance are part of Al Qaeda That is a word that designed to sow terror in the minds of anybody in the West, anyone in Europe, in the US, etc I don t think we know yet What we do know is that the opposition in Syria is very diverse, there is a part of it that has the Islamist framework, the same is true of all of the rebellions that have led to the Arab Spring We see the Muslim Brotherhood in power now in Egypt That s not Al Qaeda There were people claiming at them that it was not true, we don t know if it is true in Syria RT: Diplomatically, the efforts, what impact do you think that s had, given that the situation on the ground is escalating?PB: The fact that the UN has allowed the monitoring mission to remain on the ground for at least another 30 days is the one bit of hope that I see right now Kofi Annan s team led by [Major] General [Robert] Mood, a Norwegian general, has begun a political process in which they have been able to use in one town, another town, in small areas from the ground up to make possible a kind of diplomatic process of local commanders, of the military and local commanders of the opposition forces of the resistance to create small scale ceasefires in three or four towns The town of Deir ez Zor is one town in Syria where it s apparently working If that could be expanded, if that mandate could be shifted from simply monitoring a non existent national ceasefire to facilitating small scale local ceasefires that could then spread and move up from the bottom bringing people with it, rather than trying impose something from outside from the top down which certainly has not worked That might be one hope for a diplomatic and less militarized solution RT: Susan Rice and other foreign diplomats at the UN said that they are willing or that they will withdraw the monitors if the situation on the ground does not improve and so far it s not improving, so does it let them say that this is the time where expanding this mission? PB: They are saying this is the last time They said that the last time They will change based on political realities not based on the realities on the ground The realities on the ground are not what is determining the US position, Russian position, Qatar s position, Saudi position   anybody s positions Except for the people of Syria  What the outside powers has been doing has virtually nothing to do what has actually is going on on the ground So what we are seeing play out at the UN is a power struggle between the US and Russia, between NATO and the Gulf States on the one hand and other Arab states on the other We are seeing a bunch of different battles playing out diplomatically, almost none of which are taking into account the interests of the people of Syria RT: Where do you think that heads at? Do you think there will be intervention   since Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton and other diplomats have talked about intervention on the side of the UN Do you think that is going happen, do you think that s a possibility that the West is looking at?PB: There is already intervention underway The Western countries have provided the military of Saudi Arabia, the military of Qatar   that s where they buy their weapons from They buy American weapons So it is already Western weapons that are going in It s not coming directly from the US, but it is weapons of the West The danger of that escalating is very serious The danger of further escalation involving other outside actors is very serious I don t think the US right now, in an election cycle, I don t think the Obama administration wants to engage in a direct involvement in an air campaign, for instance, against Syria of the kind they engaged in Libya I don t think they want to Whether what is known in the US is the CNN factor, the political pressure on the president and in this case on a candidate in the election, based on what people are seeing on their TVs becomes very important It s not impossible that even the regime in power in any country, in this country, when the Obama administration does not want to engage directly, if there is enough political pressure they may give in to that pressure That s happened before it could happen again RT: McCain is trying to exercise that kind of pressure and other congressmen other senators PB: There is a number of senators, there is a number members of Congress, there are calls from the hundred tree  in the mainstream media There is a lot of pressure on the Obama administration Not because any of them have a proposal of what would actually work, but simply because they are using this as a stick to hit candidate Obama in the context of the elections That s very dangerous for the rest of the world RT: What are the solutions that you think are best now for Syria, and do you think there is time for a dialogue between the government and the opposition?PB: I think there is still time I think that the time is diminishing, I think that the level of repression from the government has been so horrific and in response the opposition   which I support as a principle of the right of people to rise up against the repressive regime   the fact that they are using stronger and stronger military strategies and military tactics makes that kind of discourse, that kind of discussion, negotiation more difficult But there is still time  I think the question remains, will the international community help to make that possible? For example by small scale, community by community, village by village, city by city negotiating processes at the grass roots, bringing together local commanders with local officials of the military to work out a ceasefire and then a political process The best thing the international community could do is to allow the UN to play that role rather than a fig leaf of international involvement, a fig leaf of multilateralism to cover the unilateral decisions of several different governments RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/syria-peace-efforts-bennis-229/

Run by a king Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and his uncle, Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the government (almost all manned by the Al Khalifa family) immediately cracked down on protesters with tremendous violence So much so, that a month later (March 2011) Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates sent in troops to restore order  so the US could smile again More torture; more bloodletting An independent report issued last November by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that the government systematically tortures prisoners, commits gross human rights violations and refuses to allow international human rights organizations into the country Somehow, that never seems to bother the Obamas, Camerons and Sarkozys of the world At one point it got so bad that Obama sent his then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Bahrain to see what was up Question: Why send the Pentagon boss and not, for example, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, who in mid March 2011 visited Tunisia and Egypt to ensure those countries installed the kind of democracy we want to see ?Answer: Because Bahrain is home to US Naval Forces Central Command s Fifth Fleet So, dear King and PM Al Khalifas: take your time, clobber as many protesters as you need, get your act right, and please make sure our fleet is safe and sound and happy End of story Libya was run by a long governing, popular revolutionary leader Muammar Gaddafi who in the last decade of his rule, had begun to re approach Western Powers, and was implementing a gradual (too gradual!) succession, transferring power to his well educated and articulate elder son, Saif al Islam Gaddafi even organized meetings and summits with EU partners, in one of which   an Arab League Summit in his home town Sirte in September 2010   Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi even kissed Gaddafi s ring, Mafia style!But all of that came too late The Gaddafis made the worst mistake any sovereign country can make nowadays: they trusted the Western Powers Huge lesson there!Contrary to Bahrain, which houses US Naval forces; or Egypt, which is aligned to Israeli geopolitical interests; or Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and UAE, which are playing fields for Western oil companies, Gaddafi s Libya kept its oil revenues for the Libyan people They ran a central bank totally independent of the US Fed, Goldman Sachs, European Central Bank, JP Morgan Chase, HSBC They even planned to introduce a gold currency the Gold Dinar with real intrinsic value to trade North African oil, which would have swept aside the US Dollar and Euro funny money paper currencies that have been hugely eroded by the bail out of the Mega Bankers running the US, UK and EU, as the Chinese understand so well In other words, Libya was a sovereign country To add insult to injury, once the uprising began a year ago, Gaddafi immediately accused one of the West s favorite sons: Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda! It seems the Western media forgot to tell you that the very first country that requested that Interpol issue an international arrest warrant against Osama was Libya!Yes! Gaddafi ordered that, after Osama and his CIA trained al Qaeda boys murdered several Germans in Libya in 1998 (only Sky News seems to have briefly mentioned this on May 2, 2011) That was long before all the al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Sudan, blew up the USS Cole, and did 9/11  rhetoric Quite embarrassing for the US, UK and Israel!Particularly now that Al Qaeda is joining forces with Syrian freedom fighters  Ah one can almost see them fighting shoulder to shoulder with John McCain and Joe Lieberman, who recently called for the US to arm Syrian rebels Funny world, isn t it? All these violent revolts, bombs, civil wars, invasions and murders done in the name of democracy  and freedom,  where the Western Powers and their media tell us in glittering lights who are the good guys  and who the bad guys  but, are the Arab people better off today than a year ago?Are Bahrainis and Egyptians happier today? Are Libyans, Syrians, and Yemenis better off today? Did the Arab Spring  reach Palestine?Is there more peace, sovereignty and true democracy in the region?Take a second look at what s happening in the Middle East and the world; think with your brain and not with the Global Power Masters and maybe then things will start looking mighty different!

"20 Dec, 2011",Michael McFaul and Russiaâs Presidential Election,"Michael McFaul was appointed US Ambassador to Russia on 17 December 2011 Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes the new ambassador is likely to try to influence Russia s upcoming presidential election In the article below, Panarin explains his view Michael McFaul is a Stanford graduate with a Ph D in international relations from Oxford University He first visited Russia in 1983 and stayed for some time while studying for his Ph D at Oxford McFaul went on to spend several years living in Russia in the 1990s, working for the Carnegie Moscow Center President Obama s nomination of McFaul to serve as the US Ambassador to Moscow became public in May this year At the time, McFaul was Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs for the US National Security Council McFaul s candidacy was submitted to Congress for endorsement in September He would have started his work in Moscow as early as November 2011, during the final stages of Russia s recent parliamentary election, if not for the Republican Party, which barred his appointment twice for partisan reasons as it tried to gain an edge in the 2012 presidential campaign which is just heating up in the United States It was therefore due to the GOP s stubborn opposition that McFaul was unable to communicate the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s critical attitude vis Ã  vis the Russian election to the leaders of Russia s so called extra systemic  opposition during the December protests in Moscow In fact, Mr McFaul himself must have a thing or two to say about Russia s democracy, being one of America s most prominent experts on Russia McFaul speaks fluent Russian and has authored and edited over 20 books on democratic governance A joint McFaul Surkov working group on civil society [ Vladislav Surkov has held the post of first deputy of the Presidential Administration since 2008 and is believed to be one of the most influential politicians in Russia and the main architect of the country s current political system   RT ] was set up in July 2009 through a joint decree by the Russian and US presidents In this capacity, McFaul had an extensive opportunity to meet Russian human rights advocates, opposition leaders and prominent press people In 2002, McFaul founded a Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford University He is still among the Center s faculty today, which is why it was especially interesting for me to visit the Center in late November this year and discuss prospects for US Russia relations post 2012 with its leading analysts It should be noted that the political school of thought created by Michael McFaul looks very impressive, as it comprises foreign policy professionals and reputed experts on Russia and the post Soviet space McFaul s team of experts is proficient in using political technologies and PR strategies, and it shares a strong focus on promoting democracy  in Russia These policy makers have developed their own vision of what democracy should be like in Russia, and are ready to offer their recipes to Russia s liberal opposition but in a soft and subtle way As soon as Russia was through with its parliamentary election this December, a number of American and British news outlets launched a media offensive against it As part of the smear campaign, FOX News ran footage of the Greek riots featuring arson and looting for several days, trying to pass it off as Moscow s post election protests One should expect that McFaul s arrival in Moscow is bound to increase the media pressure on Russia s leaders, since the American and British political elites are keen on preventing Vladimir Putin from assuming office for another term It is only the tactics that are likely to change with McFaul as ambassador McFaul is aware of the Russian extra systemic  opposition s major advantages and downsides He earlier contributed to the creation of a network of Western funded NGOs in Russia This makes him a highly efficient advisor when it comes to promoting democracy  in Russia In the meantime, there are plenty of human rights activists in Russia who are ready and waiting to upload sensational  footage of alleged electoral fraud on the Internet in order to discredit Russia s upcoming presidential election New political technologies have been successfully tested during the recent unrest in the Middle East What Professor McFaul is going to do now is fine tune them to the Russian situation and to the presidential election campaign in particular We can expect Michael McFaul to make his big move as early as late January 2012 Is the Russian government ready for this?

They aren t even allowed to go home; when would they find time to spend at an internet cafÃ©? The army has a high authority, and people really ask them to enter their settlements to protect them Kochneva is convinced that the West intentionally places a barrier for news from Syria Otherwise, she believes, the EU and the US would not have imposed sanctions on the broadcast of Dunya, a Syrian TV channel which discusses videos of this kind of detail Particularly, this channel even broadcasts the negotiations of the opposition Some crafty migrants found a way of making voice chats discussing plans for destabilizing the country publicly available Kochneva believes the authorities managed to take control over the country and to gain the support of the majority: People are laughing already at conspirators and their instructors A French ambassador who attempted to talk patriarch Ignatius into supporting the US had tomatoes and eggs thrown at him when he was taken outside A US ambassador, who was watching a rally to support peace in Syria from his car window, got wrapped in a Syrian flag with Bashar al Assad s portrait on it People are saying, Yes, there was terror, it was frightening and confusing; but we re no longer afraid of you  Russian political scientist Ruslan Kurbanov, who spent several years in the Islamic environment in Syria, agrees that there are no preconditions for a civil war; even though several years ago one would have thought that it was indeed possible to happen According to his observations, unhappiness with the authorities was in the air as early as 2005 It was mainly expressed in rumors: They said that people were disappearing They were allegedly kidnapped by Mukhabarat for being unreliable They said that kidnapped people were found several years later in prisons They whispered about terrible conditions in Syrian prisons I saw those who were personally affected by abuse of power A family member of one of them was imprisoned for opposition oriented statements; a relative of another one disappeared; a friend of yet another one went to Iraq, and now Mukhabarat examines his acquaintances But this was just a tiny percentage of people There were also rumors of stopping armed people: They said that armed people were stopped in Damascus They stated those were militants There were rumors about attacking and shooting between militants and the authorities,  says Kurbanov But the official Syrian media did not respond to these rumors in any way, neither confirming nor denying them Kurbanov notes the following characteristic episode: Policemen in the street would not respond to the traditional greeting, salam aleikum When I asked the locals why the police would not respond to my salam , I was told that all of the police are Alawis, and they do not like Sunnis, especially explicit ones  According to Kurbanov, Syria s Islamic circles have a strong feeling of resentment against the United States People are very annoyed by the US trying to impose its standards on Syria, even with regard to modes of dress, and they are upset that the Syrian government agrees to adopt these standards For example, Syria s authorities conceded to US demands and introduced tight pants for female students in high schools There were also rumors about the US dictating to the Syrian government whether it should enroll foreign applicants in Islamic universities or not Kurbanov recalls that the US had once declared Syria part of the Axis of Evil , and many Syrians feared that the Americans would start bombing Syria the way they did to Iraq However, Kurbanov believes the US quagmire in Iraq could have its own implication for Syria There were a lot of Syrians who volunteered to fight in Iraq Bashar al Assad rode this wave and agitated those who were spoiling for the fight He let Syrians volunteers infiltrate Iraq But those fighters were aware that after Iraq, they were to take on the regime back in Syria I would not rule out that the lone gunners whom the Syrian government later had to hunt down at home were actually former insurgency fighters heading back from Iraq In fact, it was not that difficult to creep over the border I have heard stories about people from Syria easily slipping into Iraq, and even Afghanistan, and then coming back I believe it is possible that some of Syria s Iraq veterans jumped into the fight at home as soon as it started Kurbanov believes that the animosity and atrocities committed by the opposition as it can be seen from TV films is a manifestation of tribal psychology rather than of an Islamic or revolutionary one: In my view, there was no soil for mutual hatred in society until the very last moment But if blood was spilled in the first protests, I assume that the crowd might easily get filled with thirst to revenge the regime and separate soldiers Even in the capital the Arabs have preserved their tribal mentality and are ready to stand up for their people Kurbanov believes that the abundance of false reels about the army atrocities has a political goal of causing chaos in the country and forcing Syria to break up its union with Iran I assume that these fakes are being injected into Syrian society to accelerate the speed of the explosion Forces that are interested in this explosion want to break up Syria s union with Iran They include the United States, Saudi Arabia and Sunni Jihad fighters,  Kurbanov said Nadezhda Kevorkova, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/war-syria-video-comments-421/
"12 Aug, 2011",US to lose its base in Kyrgyzstan,"Kyrgyzstan is not going to prolong its agreement with Washington, which entitles the US to use Manas Transit Center to supply its forces in Afghanistan, after it expires in 2014, the republic s Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev has said In full compliance with our commitments, we will inform the American side on the termination of the contract six months prior to its expiry,  the Central Asian state s premier said in an interview with Rosbalt agency Kyrgyzstan plans to turn the Center, formerly known as Manas Air Base, into a civil transportation hub Both Russian and Western investors would be welcome to participate in the creation of the facility, Atambayev added The military installation has been used as a key transit center for US and allied troops deployed to Afghanistan since the beginning of the Afghan War in 2001 However, in 2009 the Manas military base was transformed into a transit hub used for the delivery of non military cargo for the international coalition operating out of the Islamic republic That followed a string of conflicts over the sum of rent and other incidents involving the base s personnel, after which Kyrgyzstan denounced an agreement on maintaining a military air base on their territory A significant rent increase and US investments into several Kyrgyz projects helped the sides to iron out their differences and ultimately reach a compromise After the 2010 ouster of former President Kurmanbek Bakiev following bloody anti government protests, the new government was to make a decision on the fate of the base near the Kyrgyz capital Prime Minister Atambayev noted the former leadership s preconceived attitude to undertaken commitments  has spoiled Kyrgyzstan s image abroad In order to improve it, the republic has no choice but to fulfill previously reached agreements, he said Back in December 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Washington would not consider shutting down its Manas transit center until troops were pulled out of Afghanistan in 2014 And then we will look to see if there is any continuing mission that would be of benefit to Kyrgyzstan that would be continued there,  she said while speaking to Kyrgyz students and civil society representatives in a televised interview during her trip to the Central Asian state Later, while talking to the military personnel in Manas, she noted You are not going to be here indefinitely  Apparently, Kyrgyzstan no longer finds it beneficial to host the so called transit center The US was already resolved to the fact that they d have to leave the crucial hub in Central Asia sooner or later, though probably not this soon On June 23, a new ramp was opened at Manas International Airport It was constructed under an agreement between Washington and Bishkek The ramp we are opening today is a thirty million dollar improvement to the airport s infrastructure Not only will it further our ability to support the mission in Afghanistan, but it will serve as a lasting benefit to Kyrgyzstan and its economy,  said American Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pamela L Spratlen while speaking at the opening ceremony, as quoted by the embassy s official website In addition, she said, the US would contribute $30 million for a new Kyrgyz Republic air traffic control system With all of this happening at a time when the US economy is in deep trouble over its own internal debt crisis, one has to wonder if it is simply the United States boundless generosity which is at play When the republic s parliament voted to terminate their lease to the US for the air base in 2009, the then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that the US was looking for alternative locations I would say that Manas is important, but not irreplaceable We are looking at alternatives We have not foreclosed on the possibility that Manas would remain open We re looking at whether, given the importance that Manas plays and the likely growing importance of Manas, whether there is something we ought to do differently in terms of compensation,  he said, speaking at the Pentagon, as cited by the US Department of Defense website He added that the US was not prepared to stay at the Kyrgyz base at any price , but added that clearly Manas is important to us  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/manas-kyrgyzstan-american-base/
"26 Jul, 2011",US-Russia visa row heats up,"The Obama administration has imposed a travel ban on 60 Russian nationals, which Washington alleges are connected to the prison death of lawyer Sergey Magnitsky As uncertainties linger over the Obama administration s commitment to a true reset  in bilateral relations with Russia, the visa blacklist against dozens of Russian citizens will certainly dirty the diplomatic waters Washington formally announced plans for its visa blacklist, as well as a move to freeze assets belonging to certain individuals Secretary [Hillary Rodham] Clinton has taken steps to ban individuals associated with the wrongful death of Sergey Magnitsky from traveling to the United States,  the Senate document said Senior Russian government officials have warned us that they will respond if this [Senate] legislation passes,  the document reads Their argument is that we cannot expect them to be our partner in supporting sanctions against countries like Iran, North Korea, and Libya, and sanction them at the same time Russian officials have warned that other areas of bilateral cooperation, including on military transit flights to Afghanistan, could suffer from the passage of this legislation Of course, Russia won t leave without attention such unfriendly acts and will take appropriate measures to protect the sovereignty of the country and its citizens against the unlawful acts of foreign states, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a terse statement on Wednesday   The head of the Russian Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov on Tuesday said that the so called Magnitsky case was primarily Russia s internal affair, and warned that the US black list could have undesired consequences The idea of fighting crime and corruption in Russia is primarily our concern, Fedotov said in an interview with the Interfax news agency For us, it is crucial that all those who are really responsible end up on the Magnitsky list at the Russian, and not the U S border   We are doing everything we can to make sure that the people from this list are eventually barred not only from traveling to America, but also from leaving the country in any manner They should also stand trial,  Fedotov went on to say   But the Russian HR official said that U S blacklists could prompt retaliatory measures from Russia We understand the noble goals But one also needs to see the potentially unpleasant consequences   This step can generate retaliatory visa restrictions on the part of Russia,  Fedotov said When a country establishes visa restrictions against another   it is, of course, its sovereign right, but it is thus provoking the other side to set symmetrical restrictions   This appears to me to be extremely counter productive Russia stated very openly and clearly that it is looking to have all visa restrictions lifted, the official said Meanwhile, Moscow was warned against outside pressure being exerted in the case of the 37 year old lawyer who died while in pretrial detention  Investigators alleged that Sergey Magnitsky had conspired with William Browder, who has reportedly been banned from entering Russia, to set up dummy front firms to illegally buy and sell shares in Russian energy giant Gazprom In November 2009, Magnitsky died in prison following complications from an apparent case of pancreatitis This month, the authorities announced prison doctors would be prosecuted for neglecting to provide the appropriate medical care for Magnitsky while he was being detained The head of the Federal Penitentiary Service said last year that the service was partially responsible for the death of the lawyer Following Magnitsky s death, President Dmitry Medvedev put a law on the fast track that allows individuals suspected of white collar crimes,  as they are referred to in the West, to be released on bail as determined by the courts Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the death a tragedy Meanwhile, the Russian State Duma, or lower house, has been considering a bill that would target US officials with similar sanctions, referring to the extradition of Russian citizens from third party countries In 2010, alleged arms dealer Viktor Bout, a Russian citizen, was extradited to the United States following a lengthy legal battle in Thailand Bout, who has been the inspiration for at least one Hollywood film, now faces an uphill struggle to prove his innocence in the US court system Moscow expected to deliver harsh response At least one lawmaker, Leonid Slutsky, first deputy head of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, says Russia s response to the sanctions imposed by the US State Department must be tough Of course, our response must be tough and harsh, Slutsky told Interfax on Wednesday,commenting on reports that the US State Department has obtained the right to refuse US entry visas to the Russian officials it believes to be responsible for the death of Sergey Magnitsky while in detention Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Department is required to deny visas to individuals involved in human rights violations, such as torture and extra judicial killings, aState Department official told Interfax Certainly, the Russian diplomatic mission will give its tough assessment to this decision, when we receive its formal confirmation,  Slutsky said It could happen as early as today Slutsky said the Russian diplomatic community understood that the move by the US is a provocation,  that unfortunately finds support among high governmental circles in the West, and primarily in the US proper We must not yield to provocations,  he stressed, while saying that Russia must give the toughest possible, but measured response The First Deputy Head of the Duma Committee for International Affairs then mentioned the Russian US reset, put into motion by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his American counterpart, Barack Obama, which could be jeopardized by Washington s gamble Such actions by the U S State Department, if formally proved, conflict with the reset process in the U S Russian relations, he said At the same time, Slutsky noted that cooperation between Russia and the US is growing, and as damaging as the American actions may be, would probably not succeed at reversing current tendencies Of course, this reset is haphazard, but it is still proceeding, and as the chairman of the Russian peace foundation I can confirm: the constructive cooperation between the two countries civil societies is growing, Slutsky acknowledged He then warned of the dangers of allowing certain politicians to disrupt this process At times, even less significant events led to all sorts of cold and hot wars Under no circumstancesshould we allow a disruption of the reset in the relations between our countries, Slutsky said It is vital that we temper our words and actions so as not to wreck the reset process, thus taking our countries back to the threshold of the Cold War he continued Robert Bridge, RT Read related Vyacheslav Nikonov s column here RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV

"13 Jul, 2011",Russia has more in common with US than with Europe over Libya â Lavrov,"The AMD shield and the Middle East crisis were among the hot issues that were discussed by the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Wednesday in the course of Lavrov s visit to Washington In the press conference that followed the meeting, Hillary Clinton said Washington is determined to reach full mutual understanding with Russia regarding the anti missile defense and to build an efficient political framework, which would let the countries start practical cooperation on the matter This stance had been confirmed by President Barack Obama in his earlier meeting with Lavrov Speaking of Libya, the two officials reiterated their position that Muammar Gaddafi should go But Lavrov stressed again that Moscow is dissatisfied with the way the UN resolution is being followed In the parenthesis, I would like to say that on this topic we have fewer misunderstandings with the United States than with some European countries,  Lavrov said We are united that there is a need to start a political process in Libya as soon as possible Lavrov explained Russia s stance on Syria by Moscow s determination to go from words to actions Diplomacy does not exist to condemn Just condemning people without any solution will not lead us to anything,  Lavrov said, answering the question why Moscow is blocking the UN resolution, which condemns Syrian President Bashar al Assad Russia hopes for a responsible rather than opportunistic approach  to the Syrian crisis, he added   Lavrov and Clinton said the two countries have also reached several important agreements An inter country adoption agreement will provide the safety and security of Russian children adopted by American parents, increasing the transparency of this process It was worked out after seven rounds of negotiations, which lasted more than a year Moscow and Washington agreed that any adoption of Russian children may only be conducted through a licensed agency Foster children will retain Russian citizenship until they reach adulthood, while their adoptive parents will have to report on their health and mental condition regularly Russian laws will also be taken into account in courts reviewing any conflicts or crimes involving such children Russia banned adoptions to American families in 2010 after a number of high profile cases of mistreatment of children in their new families Moscow says at lest 17 foster children have been killed by their adoptive parents in the US The new agreement is meant to disperse concerns for the wellbeing of the children A new US Russia visa agreement is designed to facilitate trade and service, allowing businessmen to travel multiple times between the two countries over 36 months on a single visa The agreement is expected to be signed till the end of this year, with a few technical issues remaining Besides these two agreements, the two countries worked on their radioactive security, renewing protocols on the effects of radiation and bringing into force the agreement signed in 2010 to dispose of 34 metric tons of uranium weapons on each side The US strongly supports Russia s accession into the World Trade Organization Russia s membership would allow us to increase trade and deepen our economic ties,  said Clinton, adding that Russia s joining the WTO is one of Washington s priorities On more general terms, Washington is concerned with the state of democracy in Russia Civil societies, journalists, bloggers, lawyers and judges should be given opportunity to function properly, under no pressure and with no violations of free speech or free assembly, Clinton said Hillary Clinton also expressed sincere condolences to the victims of Wednesday s blast in Mumbai and the victims of the Bulgaria cruise ship, which sank in central Russia on Sunday claiming over a hundred of lives The high level meeting between the two officials was held behind closed doors Earlier in the day, Sergey Lavrov met US President Barack Obama, again behind the closed doors Prior to the meeting, Obama s administration confirmed that the key topic of the negotiations was the US s projected anti missile shield in Europe RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/lavrov-clinton-missile-east/
"29 Apr, 2011",Western media lie about Syria â eyewitness reports,"While media reports paint a picture of the situation in Syria as a mass public uprising brutally suppressed by the dictatorial government, the events are viewed in a totally different way by those living there RT caught up with Anhar Kochneva, director of a Moscow based tourist firm specializing in the Middle East She often travels to Syria, and stays in touch with hundreds of people in the region She shared what her contacts say about the unfolding unrest and who they blame for the spreading violence RT: What s happening in Syria? What have you seen? And that are the Syrians saying?Anhar Kochneva: Not even once did I come across anyone who would in any way support these riots; and mind you, in the line of my job, I deal with all sorts of people There are many vehicles with the president s portraits driving the streets throughout the country ranging from old, barely moving crankers to brand new Porsches and Hummers You can t force people into hanging up portraits It means that people, irrespective of their status and income, support the president rather than the rebellion I saw quite a number of young people walking or driving around with Syrian flags How can you force a young person hanging out with friends to wave flags? I think it s difficult too If you understand the mentality of the Syrians you can tell there is a sincere impulse from a forced obligation On March 29, I saw a rally in Hama to support the president indeed, many thousands of men and women, with their children, and entire families went out The streets were flooded with people It was quite a shock to see Al Jazeera presenting rallies in support of the president as if they were protests against him It was just as surprising to see the Israeli websites post photos and videos of supporters rallies with comments saying those were opponents of the regime There you have people holding portraits of Bashar al Assad and flags, and we re told that these people are against him RT: The media reports mass anti government rallies AK: There s a powerful misinformation swell going on On April 1, the media reported a large anti governmental rally in Damascus I was in Damascus on that day This rally never happened I didn t see it, and neither did the locals On April 16, Reuters news agency wrote that 50,000 opponents of the regime took to the streets of Damascus, and that they had been dispersed with tear gas and batons Damascus residents realize that such a rally could not take place in the city unnoticed How many policemen would it take to disperse it? And how come nobody saw it except Reuters? Five hundred people in the streets of Damascus are a large crowd Reuters broadcast their material around the world, including Russia One source lies, and then this lie is like a snowball rolling downhill creating a fake reality, and picking up rumor and speculation People in Syria watch the footage What do they see? A picture allegedly from Yemen A picture allegedly from Egypt A picture allegedly from Syria But the pictures all show people dressed in the same fashion People in Syria can tell their fellow countrymen from their neighbors both by their faces and their clothes There are videos on the internet showing how amateur footage of the so called riots is made There s a parked car and nothing s going on around And there s a man standing next to it throwing rocks And people around are taking pictures There are a lot of staged videos A Lebanese can tell the difference between footage taken in Lebanon and that taken in Damascus at a glance And they show footage from Tripoli, or footage taken several years ago in Iraq, and say it is unrest in Syria There are many online forums for women in Arab countries Women share information following TV reports on mass unrests Women write what s happening outside your window? And they reply: we looked down from the balcony, and didn t see anything that the TV was talking about Presently, a lot of young unarmed policemen get killed The media propaganda immediately labels them as victims of the regime I repeat, policemen are unarmed The Syrian police are not too good with guns, because nothing like this has happened here for a long time But the killed rookies are reported as either victims among the protestors, or as policemen who refused to shoot at their fellow countrymen, depending on the editors preference Goebbels words seem to be true: the bigger the lie, the more easily they believe it RT: But why are policemen dying if there are no mass protests?AK: Policemen die because they get shot by those who know that they are unarmed RT: Who shoots policemen?AK: They talk a lot about it in Syria Rumor has it that trained commandos came across the border from Iraq People in Syria are well aware that after the US occupied Iraq, they formed special squads there They were killing people, stirring up conflicts between the Shiite and Sunni communities, and between Muslims and Christians; they were blowing up streets, markets, mosques and churches Those terrorist attacks targeted civilians rather than the occupying regime Not long ago, they caught three such commandos in the outskirts of Damascus, when they were randomly shooting at people They turned out to be Iraqis Syrian TV showed footage of somebody shooting at policemen and passers by from bushes and rooftops They occasionally get caught, and they either turn out to be Iraqis, or they admit that they were paid for it Such militants were detained in Deraa and Latakia They had US made weapons The Lebanese security service intercepted several cars carrying weapons as they were coming into Lebanon One such car was stopped coming from Iraq There were American weapons in those cars too Also there are reports about detained people who had large sums of money with them with US dollars These people carried expensive satellite phones that cannot be tapped by the Syrian security service In Syria, it is no longer a secret to anyone that the Americans have an unhindered opportunity to recruit and train the commandos in Iraq, and then send them wherever they want Hilary Clinton has already stated that if Syria cuts its relations with Iran and withdraws its support for Hamas and Hezbollah, the demonstrations would stop the next day They don t even bother to keep secret the hand instilling riots in Syria There s plenty of evidence of foreign interference Finally, people say protestors are brought in from afar for the rallies Those people speak and look differently from the locals Nobody in the neighborhood knows them Who rents the buses and finances the delivery of these people?   The question stands The former Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam had initiated the riots in the coastal regions He had plundered half of the country He was involved in corruption schemes and finally fled to the West It was he who tried to accuse Syrian President Bashar al Assad of assassinating the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri The Syrians firmly believe that Sayed Hariri had personally given a villa to Abdel Halim Khaddam for spreading this version of Rafic Hariri s murder But when that version fell apart and was not confirmed, the villa was taken away Today, those who shot at cars in Banias are shouting: We don t want Bashar We want Abdel Halim!  There are peaceful and cultured opposition members in Banias who have been against al Assad s regime for many years But they are shocked by what s going on and do not support Khaddam at all They say: He s a thief He who stole most calls to fight corruption and thievery RT: What role are Syrian emigrants playing in the Syrian destabilization? AK: It s an open question There was a leak claiming that Dan Feldman, Hillary Clinton s special representative for the Middle East, met representatives of the Syrian opposition in Istanbul in mid April and suggested the tactics for assassinations of civil and military officials In less than three days, on April 19, several military officials had been brutally killed in Syria   Not only were they attacked and shot dead, some victims of the attacks, including three teenage children of a Syrian general, who were in a car with him, were cut to pieces with sabres Murders committed with a high degree of brutality are aimed at intimidating the population The news that children had been cut to pieces served that purpose quite well RT: Media reports used to say that the riots started after the arrest in the city of Deraa, in southern Syria, of several children writing anti government slogans?   Is it really so? AK: All the children had been released very quickly Moreover, the government owned Syrian newspapers published the release orders RT: Have the troops been brought into Deraa? AK: Yes, troops are there After an Islamic emirate had been proclaimed in Deraa, the local residents asked the government for help Troops have been brought in I ve just seen the videos The demonstrators published them on the internet and shortly after erased them But people made copies There are soldiers, and people come to them and talk peacefully Nobody shoots anyone RT: Is there a sentiment in Syria that if it gets rid of Hamas support and the Palestinians and strike a peace deal with Israel, all the riots will end immediately?  AK: No, there s no such sentiment There s consolidation of society The people are sticking together because they see that the enemy is extremely dangerous For instance, previously I never heard anything except pop music and the recital of the Koran on the radio when I rode in a taxi Now, patriotic music is coming from all cars When Bashar al Assad was speaking on television, the people who were listening to him at the market applauded him You cannot force people to applaud a president who speaks on television RT: What has the public mood been in recent days? AK: People are afraid of going out In some regions, people risked their lives to record with a secret camera how unidentified persons sneaked into a car, moved off and started shooting in all directions This is how they are sowing panic in residential areas  Bandits blocked a bridge on the road near the coast Soon, the military pushed them back One of my Syrian contacts told me: you don t need many people to plunge the country into trouble Putting five people on a major road would be enough to paralyze the whole area People are unable to deliver foodstuffs or reach hospitals And the whole country is in shock because of a handful of bandits Now, Syrian television is making live broadcasts from various parts of Damascus and other cities for people to see how the situation is unfolding and how life is getting back to normal, whatever the Western media show It s noteworthy that bandits intentionally tried to rouse hatred among various communities   Recently, a sheikh was insulting the Druze, particularly women, in an address to the residents of the south This video is being broadcast by the foreign media and is advertized on the internet Nothing like that ever happened in Syria before Provocations failed in Damascus though attempts were made to set religious communities against each other Provocateurs lack support in rural areas too the sowing campaign has started there The most massive demonstrations in Dera gathered 500 people But they say 450 people have been killed RT: Has the government launched any reforms? AK: The government has lifted martial law and has allowed the staging of authorized rallies if permission for them is obtained five days ahead Foreigners have been allowed to buy real estate The Kurds have been granted citizenship The Kurdish population didn t have it before for a number of historical reasons The government is opening business courses for women in northern Syria Many provincial governors have been dismissed Unfortunately, in some cases they were honest people Like those who refused to free criminals from prison for bribes and had been targeted by smear campaigns in public for it RT: Have the number of flights to Syria been cut?

"3 Mar, 2011",We are witnessing a slide into civil war in Libya - Russian lawmaker,"As events continue to unfold in the Arab world, RT spoke to the head of Russia s Foreign affairs committee Mikhail Margelov, who said it is a crucial time for the whole Arab region that is searching for its new identity RT:From the latest news, would you describe the events in Libya as a revolution or has it turned into a civil war already?Mikhail Margelov: Well, my feeling is that it looks more and more like a civil war Any revolution can turn into a civil war if it does not solve all the problems of the regime change overnight It happened in Russia after the 1917 Revolution It was happening in several countries So there is nothing strange RT:How likely is the UN US intervention in Libya?MM: Well, I suspect that today when America is involved in two difficult wars in the Islamic world Afghanistan and Iraq the decision to get into another war, in spite of whether it is short or long, will do serious damage to the image of President Obama I do not think for him For domestic consumption it will be a wise decision RT:We do hear Hilary Clinton coming out and say that they need assistance Let s help  MM: If people ask for assistance that means that the international community should consider that request But when the leader of the Interim government, former minister of the Interior whoever he is says that the people of Libya are ready to solve the problems which they face in Libya themselves Well I think if no one asks for assistance why should they give assistance? I think that for the Libyan interim government it is very important now to show that it is able to deliver And of course there is a lot of bloodshed in Libya, but it seems like the people who are against Gaddafi s regime are ready for sacrifice   RT:But some believe that Gaddafi is politically a living corpse Who is likely to replace him? And would this person need to have the US blessings?MM: I think that first of all with what is happening now in Arab world, in Tunisia, in Egypt, in Libya, in other countries we can hardly predict who is going to be the leader Neither the US nor Russia, neither the EU nor the league of Arab states were ready to predict such a chain of revolutions as have happened in the Arab world And we do not know much about the opposition leaders, because many of them are not traditional political leaders Many of them just emerge in the street during the fight In Libya I think we shall see many competing groups after the end of Gaddafi s era We shall see tribal leaders, we shall see political leaders from the north, and we shall see people who are in exile abroad and there will be a really strange cocktail of interests and spheres of interests those who will be coming back from the US will bring them some American ideas, those who will be coming from the desert will come with the nomadic civilization, heritage so we cannot say who is going to be the next leader, the new president RT:Like you have said we have seen an unprecedented wave of social uprisings across the Arab world What do these countries have to go from now? Can they handle the situation on their own?MM: Well I think that first of all we see that the new generation in Arab world is tired of ruling regimes which they did not elect People who are in power in most of these countries ruled their countries for more than 20 years And for those who are about 20 30 years old it is very difficult to say why they have these rulers So their philosophy, their way of thinking, their understanding and their search for identity is something which emerges within the Arab societies And you can hardly impose any ideology on them; you can hardly impose democracy or western standards You can hardly impose the sheer rules of Iranian standards or even the Turkish model I think that the discussion within the Arab world, about the future of the Arab world is only starting now RT:What would all this that is going on in the Arab world mean for Iran? MM: For Iran, to my mind, it is a very important time After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iran has become the strongest nation in the Middle East and Islamic world After that, this position was challenged by changing views of Turkish government Turkey demanded that it wants to be the strongest nation at least at the Sunni world or in the greater Middle East as a whole And now Iran is seeing that some Arab countries after the change of the regime, after the modernization in these countries can say No we are Arab leaders, we are leaders of the Islamic world  And I think that there will be a really serious dispute in the Islamic world as a whole, not only including Iran, Turkey and the Arab world, but also including Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia and India which has the biggest Muslim population in Asia RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/libya-world-think-arab/

of the protestors Meanwhile, the protesters have seized control of Tripoli s international airport, Itar Tass reports, with reference to the CNN Turk network According to that report, a Turkish passenger plane which was sent to evacuate Turkish citizens from the Libyan capital was not able to land because the building is reportedly under the full control of anti government protestors However, this information has not been sufficiently confirmed yet, and other sources stress that the evacuation of foreign nationals is underway, and that the airport is operating normally According to RIA Novosti, the Russian monopoly Russian Railways is preparing a flight to evacuate 204 of its employees who are currently stationed in Libya Earlier on Monday, the clashes spread to the capital, where police were said to be using tear gas and live rounds to disperse the rioters Reports are coming in from four separate protests underway in the Libyan capital of Tripoli Human rights activists claim snipers targeted demonstrators demanding an end to the 42 year rule of Gaddafi International organizations are putting the death toll in Libya at well over 600, mostly in the country s second city, Benghazi Unconfirmed reports coming from the city also suggest that some members of an army unit have sided with protesters Meanwhile, in other developments across the region, rioters continued to clash with government supporters in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, with gunfire heard on the streets While in Bahrain, the opposition is preparing for talks with authorities, after deadly clashes with government forces saw six people killed and dozens wounded Morocco is also seeing unrest, with at least 5,000 people taking to the streets of the capital Rabat, demanding King Mohammed give up some of his powers Last week, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated calls for unrestricted internet access for all, promising another US$25 million to help fight repressive regimes online According to investigative journalist Webster Tarpley, Washington is using social media to drive revolts in the greater Middle East, mirroring the color revolutions of the post Soviet space What Hillary Clinton talked about is digital activists , in other words, there is a youth bulge around the world They want to mobilize these people,  he said I think what she had in mind is a secret army of hackers and that is what they were able to deploy in Egypt  It is simple: you get the rich kids using Facebook and Twitter, you get the rich kids into the square You put that on television You convince the rest of the society that the government is deeply unpopular and the revolution takes off,  Tarpley added John Laughland from the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation in Paris agrees that a lot of the technicians  of the regime change have been active during the latest events in the region In the case of Egypt, as in the case of other countries, the interest of the United States is to present the appearance of change while maintaining political control,  he said That is what the Americans are about: revolutions serve to legitimize a continuation of the status quo effectively  Everything must change so that everything stays the same And that s, really, the motto of the Americans in these situations,  Laughland concluded US has eye on oilThe unfolding violence in the Greater Middle East hurts stocks, with oil prices rocketing It ultimately hurts the US dollar positions and moves the global economy closer to a new currency grid, says Max Keiser, economist and host of RT s Keiser Report The rise in the price of oil has been going on for a number of years now as a result of two forces in the economy , says Keiser You ve got primarily the inflationary forces with a lot of money printing going on, as these various countries are engaged in what s known as a currency war They are trying to export their way out of their economic doldrums And they do this by printing money, in a sense, the perverse effect of driving the price of oil higher It is also been revealed by WikiLeaks that Saudi Arabia seems to have been overstating its oil reserves by up to 40 per cent, which keeps in line with the general dropping of oil production all over the world This, and the currency war, is playing down the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the euro We are going to enter a new global currency arrangement , concludes Keiser It is no wonder the oil prices are rising, as Libya is the 12th largest oil exporter in the world, noted Gayane Chichakyan, RT s correspondent in Washington Moreover, the protests in Libya are much more violent than in Egypt or elsewhere in the Middle East The main question now is who will control the Suez Canal and major oil shipping lanes, says Chichakyan Washington has its fleet in Bahrain to control the canal, but Bahrain now is in deep crisis The US might be losing control in the Middle East, Chichakyan suggested, and the instability in the region is a severe blow for the US economy both in the short and long term Given all the big interests at stake in the region, there is no more democracy chanting going on in Washington,  stated the correspondent It was a little more than a week ago when Obama delivered all those passionate speeches about the people of Egypt making their voice heard and embracing democracy There is no more of that now, with the exception of Iran, of course The US is for anything that is against the Iranian leadership But the situation in other countries seems to have spiraled out of control,  said Chichakyan The US is really cautious now about calling for democracy in the countries where they have no leverage Instead of pushing for democracy, Washington will concentrate on preserving its own interests in the region, Chichikyan concluded Aziz Abu Sarah, a Middle East scholar at George Mason University, says the US has taken a weak stance on these revolts because it is afraid of more revolts in Arab countries The US has been noticeably absent throughout the whole process   from Tunisia to Egypt, now to Bahrain, which it has almost been silent on, to Libya And, he says, it has followed this policy because it afraid that the fall of the regime in Libya will create more revolts in other Arab countries Because of Tunisia and then Egypt, there have been more revolts and many more have been protesting in other Arab countries And the assumption is that if Libya falls, he argued, then youth in other countries that we haven t been expecting to protest will also start protesting But the US is also looking at its short term interests, and they are looking at the oil, he continued, because Libya is a very important oil exporter Oxford University historian Mark Almond says the wave of uprisings in the Middle East have their roots in social inequality, including discrimination against Shiites minorities, especially in sharing the wealth from oil production For all their aspiration to build a new world for themselves, many Arabs do not view the West as a model for building democratic processes in their countries, Almond argued Many Arabs don t necessarily feel gratitude to the West or feel any desire to join our club The West doesn t have the power to stop it spiraling out of control,  he added In one sense, the United States has had the power to engage uncreative destruction to help to start up the trouble But now the trouble is out of the control of the United States American military strategist and historian Edward Luttwak says the people may want change in the Middle East, but the foundations for democracy are not yet set in place Democracy is not something you can buy in a shop,  he said It takes centuries of development to get a

"1 Feb, 2011",Yeltsin: epitome of 1990s Russia remembered,"Russia is marking the 80th birthday of the man who took Perestroika to another level when the Soviet Union dissolved Boris Yeltsin Starting early in the morning, people began laying flowers at the first Russian president s grave at Moscow s Novodevichy cemetery Yeltsin s family traveled from his home town of Ekaterinburg to join those paying their respects Four years after his death, the first President of Russia is remembered for his reforms, free market aspirations and privatization policies Yeltsin s 80th birthday is being celebrated with much greater pomp than his 70th a whole series of events are planned throughout the country: rock concerts, a tennis [Yeltsin s favorite game] tournament for children to name just a few Certainly the main event is Tuesday s unveiling of a white marble obelisk dedicate to him in Ekaterinburg where he lived for most of his life It was in Ekaterinburg that he gained a university degree and got married He advanced through the Communist Party ranks up to the very top The only other Yeltsin monument is on his grave at Novodevichy cemetery A Boris Yeltsin memorial center has also been opened a tradition borrowed from the US, where there is a wide net of presidential libraries dedicated to the legacies of former presidents The Yeltsin center will be dedicated to the promotion of civil society and human rights Boris Yeltsin will always remain a very polarizing figure for Russian society He is generally credited for bringing democracy to Russia Both of his successors, Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev commended him for making Russian democracy irreversible He was also known for overseeing a major transition of the world s largest command economy into a free market but all of his reforms came at a very high price for Russia During his rule, Russia s external debt increased by 60 per cent and the suicide rate increased by 70 per cent For most Russia s citizens the transition period turned into a nightmare Yeltsin is blamed for not preventing the collapse of the Soviet Union, something that the overwhelming majority of citizens were against and voted against during a specially organized referendum For most people the blow of the reforms was too hard and Yeltsin was blamed for not softening it The latest polls suggest that as time goes by Russians tend to forget the bad and are growing a little bit more sympathetic for the first Russian president According to the Levada center, an independent polling organization, the number of those who viewed Yeltsin s legacy in a negative light has decreased from some 60 per cent in 2000 to 35 per cent in 2011, while the percentage of positive opinions about his reforms has correspondingly grown The current President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, attended the monument s unveiling ceremony and will be presiding during a meeting of a council dedicated to civil society and human rights The path of our first president was a very difficult one Every single citizen of our country realizes this today The first president always has his work cut out for him He needs to change the entire political system and this was the fate that befell Boris Yeltsin We must admit that he was up to the task and stood his ground honorably,  Dmitry Medvedev said The modern, but not perfect, country we live in today was created thanks to Boris Yeltsin and everyone who helped him to build the foundation of a new nation  Boris Yeltsin himself never doubted he would live to celebrate his 100th birthday but instead his widow has to fight back tears while opening an exhibition timed to what would have been his 80th birthday In nearly four years since Boris Yeltsin s death, the agony of loss has given way to quiet remembrance He really liked family gatherings, birthdays We usually celebrated with our daughters,  remembers the first president s widow Naina Yeltsina Most of the photos exhibited at a photographic exhibition coinciding with the anniversary show Yeltsin in his early years in power when he had the backing of almost the entire country When voicing your political position was still an act of novelty and courage and when hopes of a different life in a better country were still untainted by the harsh reality The war in Chechnya, which Yeltsin himself admitted was a mistake, the banking crisis that would cripple the already impoverished population   all that would come later And as some argue, would unfairly obscure all the good that Yeltsin had done Yeltsin s press secretary Sergey Yastrzhembsky believes that Anything large is better perceived from a distance, especially in history I think we still need more time for the emotions and trifles to give way to serious analysis of what a titanic figure Yeltsin really was Vladimir Shevchenko served as his head of protocol for more than eight years And while Yeltsin s explosive character and unpredictable temperament often contravened the dry rules of diplomatic engagement, Vladimir says he had never had a better boss He never thwarted a single event and he was never late But emotionally he could be absolutely unpredictable and do what no one expected him to do like his famous conducting of an orchestra, for example,  Vladimir Shevchenko, head of Yeltsin s protocol, remembers And again, he was overwhelmed by emotions He turned his head and saw that Shevchenko was the only one who was objecting and dragging him away All the other people around him were applauding He was ushered into power by the great hopes of his people and left office full of regret for not fulfilling all of them And it was only after Yeltsin passed away that his country could start to examine his legacy in all its complexity Boris Yeltsin s 70th birthday was celebrated with far fewer accolades But one decade later even those who used to criticize him very harshly are growing a bit more gracious in their assessment of his character and his policies because even they have also come to realize that, with all his ups and downs, Yeltsin was the very epitome of Russia in the 1990s A deputy director of the Yeltsin Foundation, Evgeny Volk, says that Yeltsin managed to demolish the totalitarian cabinet system which represented the dramatic threat for both sides   Russian citizens and the whole world, and that it took Russia US relations to a new level I think that Yeltsin has over wisely rejected the legacy of the Cold War The American Russian relationship was based on the zero some  game, which meant what is good for Russia, for the Soviet Union, was meant to be bad for America Otherwise, what was good for the United States was interpreted to be bad for Russia Yeltsin established a cooperative kind of relationship with Washington He had a personal friendship with American president Bill Clinton   And he made Russia a part of the civilized international community, establishing a new kind of partnership with the United States  The first Russian president was never ever under pressure from anyone, points out Leon Aron, the director of Russian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of a book on Boris Yeltsin While he was in office, it was a time of complete media freedom and it was a time of unimpeded access to the electoral process for the opposition in terms of formation of parties and candidates running in the elections Yeltsin allowed free and fair elections, including two referendums, three general elections and the presidential election, which were considered by both the opposition and the international observers completely free and fair, said Aron It is most impressive that even after the armed rebellion in Moscow, in October 1993, within two weeks Yeltsin lifted all the censorship on the opposition media and also allowed all the parties which participated in the rebellion with the exception of five radical ones to actually participate in the elections to the newly established parliament,  Aron explained, reminding that everybody was allowed, including the opposition, to the counting of the votes  Political analyst from Russia s Kommersant newspaper Sergey Strokan says even though Russia remains divided over Yeltsin s controversial legacy, it is hard to underestimate what the first president of Russia did for the country It s equally true that we ve managed to undergo those tests and re emerged as a strong power And at present when we speak about President Medvedev and his modernization drive I see certain similarity with what Yeltsin was doing, because Yeltsin was also a reformer, a modernizer of Russia , believes Strokan RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This

"17 Nov, 2010",Democracy promotion: Americaâs new regime change formula,"Washington s formula for regime change underwent a makover in the 1980s In a bid to ensure US political and economic interests were safeguarded, CIA backed coup d Ã©tats ousted democratically elected leaders from Iran to Chile Washington s formula for regime change underwent a makover in the 1980s In a bid to ensure US political and economic interests were safeguarded, CIA backed coup d Ã©tats ousted democratically elected leaders from Iran to Chile In their place were brutal dictatorships and governments that committed heinous crimes against their people By the 1980s, the reign of terror that blazed across Latin America was too much for most people to stomach From death squads to torture chambers and various massacres, the Latin American generals who trained in the US to spread democracy around the world quickly gained reputations for major human rights abuses To replace the overt support for dictatorships, a new concept for regime change was born; one that sounds and looks better democracy promotion The concept of democracy promotion is simple; finance, train, and politically back local opposition forces around the world that support the American agenda Dr William Robinson is one of the foremost experts on Washington s democracy promotion initiatives, he wrote the book Promoting Polyarhcy In Latin America, in Eastern Europe with the Velvet Revolutions, in Africa, in the Middle East, really all over the world, the U S set up these different mechanisms now for penetrating these civil societies in the political systems of countries that are going to be intervened and to assure the outcome is going to be pleasing to Washington s foreign policy objectives,  said Robinson Lawrence Wilkerson, the former Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, We do this through surrogates and nongovernmental organization and through people who are less suspecting of the evil that may lurk behind their actions than perhaps they were before Have we learned some lessons in that regard? You bet! Do we do it better? You bet? Is it still just as heinous as it has always been? You bet! So while the goal remains the same, it s no longer the CIA but the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and its partners spearheading the effort Allen Weintein, one of the founders of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) explained to the Washington Post in 1991, A lot of what we do now was done covertly by the CIA 25 years ago And like the CIA, USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy and a number of similar organizations receive funding from Congress Millions and millions of U S tax payer dollars go every year into funding for political organizations and campaigns in different countries in the world that promote US agenda Most U S citizens are unaware of the fact that that is how their money is being spent, to meddle, and to influence and to interfere in other nation s affairs,  said Eva Golinger who has been investigating the US s democracy promotion efforts in Venezuela The concept of facilitating regime change through democracy promotion has garnered wide criticism not just abroad but also at home in the United States Congressman Ron Paul once wrote It is particularly Orwellian to call US manipulation of foreign elections promoting democracy How would we Americans feel if for example the Chinese arrived with millions of dollars to support certain candidates deemed friendly to China? I think it s terrible, we use taxpayer s money to go over and use our military and the CIA these programs that say this is what you outta do and influence them There is no authority for that, it doesn t work, it teaches a lot of people to despise us,  Congressman Paul told RT Democracy promotion has been a long standing element of US foreign policy It operates as a key component of soft power linked to the diplomacy apparatus of Washington The moneys go from the U S State because we need to see this starts with the U S state They go into the country that is going to be intervened and inside that country they identify a series of groups that are going to receive this money but also receive this kind of political influence that comes with giving money and comes with on the ground operatives tied to this money,  explained Robinson When the U S starts an interventionist program, they identify the different sectors it wants to organize So it s identifies the trades union movement and where are the pliant parts, the objective is to marginalize radical trade unions and bolster conservative trade unions They identify women movements, marginalize radical movements and mobilize conservative women moments Then they do the same with youth All sectors of civil society will be identified and those that can be brought on board to the US interventionist project will be brought on board and funded One of many examples is the color revolutions in Eastern Europe As I saw happen for example in Ukraine, as I saw happen in Georgia, as I see happening in other places too, they don t just propagandize or attempt to help with words and rhetoric that opposition, they actually do things that give that opposition more power,  said Wilkerson, recalling the involvement of USAID and NED William Blum, a US historian and the author of the book Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions since WW II  said, They copy from one area to another, the first one that was successful was the one in Serbia and they borrowed things from that revolution Certain slogan, symbols and colors, and they use it again and again Analysts recall the similarities in the color revolutions where youth groups were energized, rock bands lined up, and laser shows put on The movements were marketed as cool The objective was to make them into a national passion, a national fad if you well,  said Blum Student leaders of the Serbian youth group Otpor who played a key role in the 2000 ousting of Slobodan Milosevic met 7 to 10 times with officials from USAID affiliates, according to the NY Times The same group also received several hundred thousand dollars for demonstration material, t shirts and stickers On the other side of the world, in Latin America, some of the most active and capable programs have and continue to flourish in countries where Capitalism isn t the agenda Blum contends, Venezuela, easily, that is the place where they send the most money Chavez is enemy number one One opposition lawmaker that has been a key figure in Washington s democracy promotion model in Venezuela is Maria Corina Machado; a woman who is by many standards and to plenty of critics, a product of US interventionism Machado rose to fame with an NGO known as Sumate, an organization that received hundreds of thousands of dollars from USAID and NED Sumate led fierce campaigns against democratically elected President Chavez and his Bolivarian Revolution, including a referendum against the President in 2004 In our case, we did receive funding from NED as did several, tens of organizations here in Venezuela,  Machador confessed Like Georgia s Saakashvili, foreign financing bolstered Machado s image on the national and international stage, even granting her a meeting with President George W Bush This is about promoting an individual; this is about promoting someone who has the capacity to rise to power and share US agenda,  said Golinger Since 2000, USAID has activated more than 620 programs in Venezuela alone, costing up to $20 million dollars In 2002, a government document from USAID s Office of Transition Initiatives explained a possible coup against Chavez was in the making The author of the memo, OTI director Russell Porter wrote about the urgency of sending an assessment team to Venezuela as soon as possible with a prejudice toward starting an active program to support civil society and the media Another 2003 declassified memo drafted by USAID s OTI in relation to the 2004 referendum said, the overarching strategic objectives of the program remain the same: that is supporting the continuation of stable, free market orientated democracy in Venezuela Other documents declassified through Freedom of Information Acts show USAID affiliates NDI and IRI were awarded $500,000 each for campaign schools in Venezuela These campaign school s were responsible for campaign strategy and organization, message development, outreach, fund raising, public relations, get out the vote techniques, and candidate selection That same cable also cites the importance of co opting Venezuela s poor, with the barrios as the main target The barrios have long been known as Chavez strongholds In Latin American, democracy promotion programs target governments or organizations that have a socialist, anti free market leaning The President of NED Carl Gershman insists democracy promotion does not mean regime change To him [Gershman], Democracy equates to Capitalism, the idea of socialism and democracy is alien to him, if he is working against a socialist government or movement, he is working for democracy,  said Blum Funding democracy with US taxpayer dollars Democracy, US style, doesn t come cheap Most of the money flows to forces in line with US interests Washington has spent a far amount of money spread democracy worldwide We re talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars, and over the years since this policy was consolidated, we re talking about billions The State Department will have an appropriation of several billion dollars for what it called the Office of Transition Initiatives The Congress will have an appropriation hundreds of millions of dollars for the National Endowment for Democracy, USAID will have its own budget as well,  said Robinson Over the past two decades, USAID has spent 9 billion dollars promoting Washington s democracy initiatives The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) received $132 million dollars during 2009; nearly all of the money came from U S government agencies However, USAID and NED are not the only ones There is an entire network of organizations involved in the democracy promotion business such as the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the International Republican Institute (IRI), and the American Center for International Labor, the Center for International Private Enterprise and Freedom House But these are just the tip of the iceberg There s an entire network of organizations involved in the democracy promotion business Although all the organizations insist there is no political affiliation, the board of directors for both NDI and IRI suggest otherwise Both boards consist of former Secretaries of State, national security advisers, members of Congress, and even Clinton, Bush and Reagan administration officials They all have a history in Washington One deeply rooted in sustaining the current foreign policy priorities Blum said, to understand US foreign policy, one must understand a very basic fact; the US government wants to dominate the world He insists the soft money working behind scenes is directly linked to the CIA They had to have a new organization with a nice sounding name, with the word democracy, which would be free of the taint of the CIA, and that s why the NED was created,  Blum added One of the key areas the democracy promotion network has invested in is Central America, where there is a rising tide in leftist, socialist ideologies According to the North American Congress on Latin America, USAID s latest $2 million disbursement to Honduras was based on proposals to make the Central American country economically competitive on the global market Since 2004, the United States has spent over $18 million on democracy promotion in Honduras While USAID requests $800,000 for more democracy promotion programs in Honduras for FY 2011, journalists and activists are being brutalized and killed under the U S backed governmentIn Egypt, a revolt against the US backed policies of Hosni Mubarak regime has mobilized these agencies to co opt opposition groups to ensure the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections are beneficial to Washington Wael Nawara of the opposition party Al Ghad told RT funding and guidance from NED, NDI, IRI and USAID has increased in the past two years, and that NDI and IRI are operating in Egypt illegally Other countries the US has intervened in include the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ecuador, El Salvador, Kyrgyzstan, and the Palestinian territories The USAID has implemented so called democracy promotion initiatives in over 100 countries in the past 25 years This year s budget is $1 billion dollars According to USAID s website, spending $10 million in a target country increases its amount of democratic change fivefold Blum insists there is pure hypocrisy in Washington s democracy promotion agenda We have a very clear law on the books prohibiting foreign governments from interfering in our elections of supporting any candidates with money So we do exactly abroad what we prohibit here at home,  he said Encouraging transparency is a stated core element of the US government s democracy promotion efforts in foreign countries But here at home the agencies themselves are far from transparent Detailed program budgets and information are unavailable to the public and contact with the media is limited Over the last six weeks, RT repeatedly requested interviews from USAID, NED, IRI and NDI All of these requests were denied or unanswered Pepe Escobar, a South America based journalist for the Asia Times said US democracy promotion programs use political or other grievances in countries to push and coordinate their own agenda They use the locals,  said Escobar They mix their preoccupations and their grievances with the classic full spectrum dominance Washington agenda The US targets nations who are strategic competitors and regimes that antagonize the United States It utilizes the Pentagon and CIA strategy of full spectrum dominance Escobar explained that anti government messages are often propelled through mainstream corporate media outlets in Brazil and Venezuela that are indirectly linked and influenced by US organizations like Freedom House and the National Endowment for Democracy He argued that over time it is possible other nations, like China, will use their growth to influence US elections; however that could take some time They [China] still do not understand the notion of soft power and smart power,  Escobar said Maybe it s going to take a generation to understand how the West thinks  Jacob Hornberger, the president of The Future of Freedom Foundation explained that this policy of democracy promotion is not merely an Obama or Bush policy, but instead a systemic issue in overall US policy This is essentially US foreign policy and has been for decades,  he said They funnel money into elections, they engage in invasions, assassinations, coups, regime change operations That s what foreign policy has been about for a long time Those who feel the policy is truly the promotion of democracy are operating under a lie, Hornberger argued The Government has no more commitment to democracy than it does to dictatorship,  he said The US government supports those who best serve their interest at a given time, including having supported leaders Saddam Hussein in the past They re trying to get their people in public office in countries all over the world,  Hornberger said They will stop at nothing to affect that kind of regime change when the administration in that country isn t towing the official line With the government on the brink of bankruptcy, Americans should be more outspoken against these programs which spend millions in US taxpayer dollars The US has entered the realm of imperialism and needs to return to the republican form of governance it was founded on, argued Hornberger This is not the limited government paradigm on which our country was founded It s a paradigm based on an empire from which our nation was born in resistance to empire,  he said What Americans have to decide is what do we want? Do we want an empire that is bankrupting this country?  asked Hornberger Or do we want to restore a republic and a sense of normality and peace and prosperity to America?  RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/democracy-promotion-usa-regime/
"6 Oct, 2010",There are no unsolvable problems in the Arctic â FM Spokesman,"According to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrey Nesterenko, the Arctic presents no unsolvable problems or problems that might require a military solution With the increased attention to the Arctic and the importance that the Arctic has for Russia, and Russia for the Arctic, it is only natural that our country has lately become a venue for major international forums dedicated to this region Just now, on September 22 23, the First International Arctic Forum, The Arctic: Territory of Dialogue,  was successfully held in Moscow Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin delivered an important report there From October 1 3, Murmansk will host the Second Arctic International Economic Forum, the focus of which will be socio economic development and the expansion of economic co operation in the Far North Dialogue, international law, and goodwill these in our view are the foundations on which all issues are being tackled and will continue to be tackled in the Arctic In particular, an agreement to this effect was reached at the first ministerial meeting of the five Arctic coastal states at Greenland s Ilulissat in 2008, and this agreement is being successfully implemented in practice The latest example: the recent signing of the Russia Norway Agreement on Delimitation and Co operation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean, an event whose significance extends far beyond bilateral relations and which serves as a positive precedent for our other partners in the region There are no unsolvable problems or problems that might require a military solution in the Arctic We are satisfied that co operation has become the predominant feature of the development of the situation in the Arctic This is fully consistent with our national interests as set forth in the Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Arctic for the Period up to 2020 and beyond, approved by President Medvedev in 2008, and Russia will do its utmost to strengthen this trend All questions in the Arctic can be solved through co operation And an artificial sharpening  of Arctic problems most frequently comes either from a lack of knowledge of the reality, or, as noted by Prime Minister Putin, from the desire of some people to fish in troubled waters  With regard to the exploitation of Arctic resources, one of the main requirements here for obvious reasons is special attention to protecting the fragile Arctic ecosystems And this is an important specific area of international co operation in the Arctic, particularly within the Arctic Council President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev paid an official visit to China from 26 to 28 September, 2010 During his visit Medvedev traveled to three cities: Dalian, Beijing and Shanghai Details are posted on the website of the President of Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend the 8th Summit of the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) to be held on October 4 5 in Brussels The summit will officially formalize the accession of Russia, as well as Australia and New Zealand to this group ASEM was founded in March, 1996, and now consists of 45 members the 27 EU member states, the European Commission and 16 Asian States (the ten ASEAN members plus China, Japan, Korea, India, Pakistan and Mongolia), as well as the ASEAN Secretariat ASEM was formed as a mechanism for inter regional, multi sector co operation, within which the participating countries engage in collaborative activities in the fields of politics and security and in the financial, economic and socio cultural spheres The agenda of the forum covers areas such as overcoming the effects of the global financial and economic crisis; combating international terrorism and trans frontier organized crime; WMD non proliferation; energy security; sustainable development; climate change; combating the spread of infectious diseases; human rights, etc Russia s joining the activities of this unique dialogue mechanism is a confirmation of the interest of the ASEM members in deepening the partnership with Russia, a Eurasian state, a bridge  between Europe and Asia, whose participation in this forum is an objective fact We are actively co operating with the countries of both continents and developing dialogue partnerships with the EU and ASEAN We regard the upcoming accession of Russia to the ASEM as an important step in pursuing the line set by the President of the Russian Federation on strengthening the position of our country in the Asia Pacific Region and building up Russian participation in multilateral regional associations Russia intends to make a real practical contribution to the work of ASEM for the development of multilateral regional co operation It primarily concerns the creation here of a transparent and equitable security and co operation architecture, which would be based on collective principles, norms and principles of international law and due consideration for the legitimate interests of all states in the region We believe that the move toward this goal should proceed through the development of multilateral network diplomacy and the creation of a partner network of organizations and forums Russia s joining in advance ASEM s multidisciplinary activities and contacts with the forum participants gave us the opportunity to effectively and usefully prepare for entry into ASEM We support the agenda proposed by Belgian organizers, under the overarching theme of how to ensure greater prosperity and more dignity for all citizens Sergey Lavrov will speak on the Global Challenges  theme We look forward to a fruitful discussion on all important issues: overcoming the effects of the global financial and economic crisis; sustainable development; global and regional issues; human contacts; and streamlining ASEM activities In Brussels, Sergey Lavrov will also have a number of bilateral meetings with foreign participants of the summit The 65th UN General Assembly session is continuing in New York Please note, the text of the statement made by Russia s Permanent Representative to the UN Vitaly Churkin during the general debate is published on the Ministry website An OSCE Review Conference is opening in Warsaw today It will precede the OSCE s summit to be held December 1 2, 2010 in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, chair of the Organization in 2010 There will be three parts of the Review Conference: in Warsaw (30 September 8 October), Vienna (18 26 October) and Astana (26 28 November) It will examine how member states are fulfilling their political commitments assumed in the politico military, economic environmental and humanitarian dimensions of security, and how effectively the OSCE executive structures do their job its Secretariat, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, High Commissioner on National Minorities, the Representative on Freedom of the Media, and field missions operating in 16 countries in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Central Asia and the Trans Caucasus The Russian delegation at the conference will comprise experts from the relevant ministries and agencies Representatives of civil society organizations (NGOs) will also take part Russia has faithfully fulfilled and will continue to fulfill all the political commitments it assumed within the OSCE We urge all other member states to do the same We call for reviewing the political commitments that have been unjustly forgotten, such as the freedom of movement/liberalization of visa regimes in the first place We look forward to a thorough and constructive discussion on the strengthening of confidence building and security instruments in the military domain, and their adaptation to the new conditions and practice of military construction We consider it necessary to begin serious work on correcting imbalances in the work of the OSCE institutions and field missions, which today, unfortunately, is characterized by a selective  approach and focuses mainly on the countries east of Vienna  We consistently advocate transforming the OSCE into a fully fledged intergovernmental organization that works according to clearly defined, collectively agreed rules An important step in this direction would be the adoption of a Charter of the OSCE The delegation intends to raise all these and other issues at the Review Conference that opened today We believe if all OSCE states without exception, regardless of their participation in military alliances or other associations, equally and faithfully fulfill their obligations across the board, then we will be able to create a truly indivisible area of equal security and co operation from Vancouver to Vladivostok We hope that the Review Conference will contribute to the success of the OSCE Summit, the chief objective of which in our view is to reaffirm and strengthen the principle of indivisibility of security and to increase the relevance of the OSCE as a platform for dialogue and joint action in areas of common interests throughout the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok Work on the draft Russian Polish intergovernmental agreement on local border traffic, which aims to extend the simplified travel regime to the whole of Kaliningrad Region, as well as the adjacent areas of Poland, is now practically over The only obstacle to its conclusion is the EU rule that sets border zone width at 30km If mechanically applied to the Russian Polish agreement, the approach would leave Kaliningrad Region divided into two parts, landing its residents in an unequal position, in terms of the regime for travel to Poland In this regard, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, guided by the tasks of further deepening Russian Polish co operation in various fields and expanding the range of measures aimed at the overall facilitation of contacts between citizens of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Poland and of Russia and the EU member states, sent a joint appeal to their EU counterparts and the European Commission calling for improvement of the existing internal EU rules governing local border traffic The corresponding document is transmitted to the recipients through diplomatic channels We count on a constructive response from the European colleagues and on an early positive decision by the European Commission The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Embassy in Venezuela (our ambassador in Caracas is concurrently accredited to Santo Domingo), with the active co operation of Children Rights Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov and officials from several other Russian agencies, have solved the question of the repatriation of Dmitry Khokhryakov, an underage Russian citizen (born in 1998), seven years ago taken by his adoptive parents to the Dominican Republic and then left there to the mercy of fate Upon receipt of the documents, local authorities promptly and favorably responded to our request for the return of the child, for which Sergey Lavrov personally thanked the President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, during their bilateral meeting in New York on September 23 On September 27, Pavel Astakhov flew to Santo Domingo He will accompany the boy to Russia (the flight to Moscow is scheduled for September 30) The head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Venezuela is also there now; he is rendering the Ombudsman all necessary assistance The latest expert consultation in July basically produced the agreed text of a Russian US adoption agreement, meant to provide reliable guarantees for the rights of adopted children Now the parties are to complete internal interagency approvals for the draft A final round of bilateral negotiations will then follow, resulting in the submission of the agreement for signature Hopefully this can happen before the end of this year The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela held elections to the National Assembly on September 26 Supporters of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won a majority of seats in the supreme legislative body of the country We note with satisfaction that the polls, witnessing voter turnout of more than 65 per cent, passed in compliance with democratic norms and principles, in a peaceful and transparent manner Representatives of the Russian Central Election Commission and deputies of the State Duma, who were in friendly Venezuela as members of the Program of International Election Monitoring, underscore the competent preparation and good organization of the voting process We commend the responsible attitude of the main political parties of Venezuela, which have accepted the results of the expression of the people s will In recent months we have been following the dynamics of the complicated situation in Kyrgyzstan with special attention On October 10, citizens of the country will elect deputies to the Zhogorku Kenesh the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic Of course, this is a major event in social and political life, and a landmark moment in the evolution of the democratic process in Kyrgyzstan We would hope that the elections will be held in a relaxed atmosphere, fairly and transparently, and will make it possible to form the highest legislative and then executive bodies of power in the Republic capable of coherent, efficient operation At the invitation of the Kyrgyz side, it is planned to send Russian election observers on behalf of the Central Election Commission of Russia, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, EurAsEC, the SCO, and as members of the monitoring mission of the OSCE/ODIHR As previously noted, the Russian side at the request of the Kyrgyz partners is providing all necessary assistance in selecting and equipping polling stations in several Russian cities for the voting of citizens of Kyrgyzstan staying temporarily in the territory of our country We are talking mainly about Kyrgyz labor migrants Those in Russia, according to the Federal Migration Service, number about 300,000 If necessary, we would be willing to make additional voting facilities available to this category of Kyrgyz citizens who wish to use them On the working trip of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs/State Secretary Grigory Karasin to Kyrgyzstan and his meeting with the co chairing Troika of Geneva Discussions on Security and Stability in the Trans CaucasusRussian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs/State Secretary Grigory Karasin made a working trip to Kyrgyzstan on September 27 29 During his trip Karasin visited, apart from Bishkek, the city of Osh and met with representatives of several political parties and movements of the Republic On September 29, in Moscow, he met the co chairing Troika of Geneva Discussions on Security and Stability in the Trans Caucasus representing the EU, UN and OSCE They discussed the political and military aspects of the situation in the Trans Caucasus, and preparations for the 13th round of Geneva Discussions, scheduled for mid October I was asked by Reuters: How can the Russian Foreign Ministry comment on the situation with the extradition of Tajik opposition leader Mahmadruzi Iskandarov from Russia, while the European Court of Human Rights found that his removal was unlawful and fined the authorities of the Russian Federation?  On September 23, 2010 the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights rendered its judgment on the merits of the Iskandarov vs Russia complaint, in which it ruled that the Russian authorities had violated Article 3 (prohibition of torture) and Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Procedurally, the Court ruling is not final In accordance with the provisions of the European Convention, an ECHR Chamber judgment comes into force in three months if neither party appeals against it to the Grand Chamber Currently, the ruling is being scrutinized by competent Russian agencies, in particular, in the Office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the ECHR and in the Prosecutor General s Office of the Russian Federation The World Thematic Conference of Compatriots will be held in Moscow from October 7 8, 2010 Its organizers plan to invite 150 representatives of the Russian intellectual and academic elite from the near and far abroad, as well as 70 guests from Russia, including representatives of the Russian Presidential Administration, the Federal Assembly chambers, the apparatus of the Government, federal and regional executive bodies, research and development institutions and other organizations, and members of the Russian and foreign media Discussions at the Conference will be held in plenary meetings and in four sections: Section 1 Politicians, businessmen and heads of organizations of compatriots  Section 2 Scientists  Section 3 Healthcare  Section 4 Culture and book publishing  During the Conference, a regional meeting of compatriots living in the Trans Caucasus is also scheduled to be held on October 8 in the afternoon For journalists the presentation is planned of a project being implemented under the auspices of the Government Commission for the Affairs of Compatriots Abroad, for the publication of books under the general title Russians in ¦ , as well as a final press conference The Conference will end with the ceremony of bestowing on compatriots of the Honorary Compatriot Badge and the Commission s Honorary Diplomas Venue: Moscow, Olympiyskiy Prospekt, 18/1, Renaissance Moscow Hotel, Conference Room Theater  Q: The British side has said that the new British Foreign Secretary William Hague is to make a visit to Russia soon How can you comment on this statement? A: I can confirm that we are waiting for the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs William Hague in Moscow in mid October He will visit the Russian capital at the invitation of Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov The upcoming talks will focus on the state of, and prospects for co operation between Russia and the UK, in the bilateral sphere as well as on pressing international and regional issues Given some recent positive changes in Russian British relations and the intensified political contacts we hope that the upcoming visit of William Hague will help build on these trends Q: The other day some Japanese media quoted the Foreign Minister of Japan as saying that he had handed to the Russian ambassador a request for the Russian President not to visit the Kuril Islands Could you comment on these statements? Is it true that the Russian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry of Japan? A: In the past two days, we have seen many reports and comments on this matter I can say just this The President of Russia independently determines the routes of his trips on the territory of his country, and any advice  here is inappropriate and unacceptable Moscow has taken note of the fact that senior Japanese officials recently voiced publicly the well known position of Tokyo on the question of sovereignty over the South Kurils, claiming that they belong to Japan So we consider it necessary to once again state that these islands are the territory of the Russian Federation owing to the international legal reality that emerged following World War II and which is enshrined in particular in the UN Charter We are convinced that in the interests of the sustained development of bilateral relations Japan should avoid counter productively repeating dead end positions in statements, take active steps to expand co operation in key areas, strengthen constructive co operation in international affairs, and quietly continue the dialogue on a mutually acceptable solution to the question of the conclusion of a peace treaty and subsequent border demarcation The Ambassador of Russia to Japan recently took advantage of an invitation from the leadership of the Japanese Foreign Ministry to present this Russian position Q: On September 25 Minister Lavrov said that Russia had received an invitation to attend a Russia NATO summit According to him, a report is being prepared to President Medvedev Is there any progress in this matter? A: Minister Lavrov has said a lot about this, and yesterday Deputy Minister Alexander Grushko gave a detailed interview to Interfax news agency detailing our arguments in this regard Q: Chairman of the Iranian parliament s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said that the question of Russia s refusal to deliver S 300 missile systems to Iran would be solved judicially, implying lawsuits among other things What s Russia s reaction? Do you expect any lawsuits? A: Our position on this issue is exhaustively stated in President Medvedev s Decree No 1154 of September 22, 2010 It remains unchanged With regard to possible actions by Iran, we need to acquaint ourselves with them in detail, and then we can make some conclusions and comments Q: Could you elaborate on the outcome of the consultation in Vienna on Transdniestr?A: With regard to the outcome of the consultation we will soon publish an official comment on that Q: How can you comment on the statement of US State Secretary Hillary Clinton during the RNC meeting in New York that all countries, including Georgia and Moldova have the right to decide the question of the presence of foreign troops on their territory, including in the context of Transdniestr? A: With regard to the RNC, its meeting was held behind closed doors I haven t seen any news reports broadcasting this or that statement I am not familiar with this statement of Hillary Clinton, so I cannot comment on it Q: Could you comment on the statement of Moldova s Deputy Prime Minister that the evolution of the Transndiestrian conflict offers the possibility that the US and the EU could become mediators in this process? A: The current format is embedded in the relevant multilateral agreements To change it, you need substantive consultation and the consent of all those who are part of this format Q: What is the position of the Russian Federation with regard to Iran, which has expressed willingness to negotiate with the Six, as well as in respect of the US and Western countries that conduct unilateral sanctions against Iran? A: If Tehran s readiness is realized in practical matters, then it is welcome, because we have always called for a politico diplomatic solution to the issue and waited for positive steps from Tehran As to your second question, it has repeatedly been commented upon There is nothing I can add to what Minister Lavrov said during his news conferences Q: Is there any information that President Medvedev might visit the South Kurils during a trip to the summit of the Big Twenty and APEC in Japan? A: The President addressed this issue while on the Kamchatka Peninsula I can add nothing more Q: The Russian ship Lyubov Orlova, with 49 Russians on board, has reportedly been arrested at a Canadian port The seafarers are trying to contact the Foreign Ministry Do you have more information on this? A: Russia s ambassador to Canada informed us yesterday that he is in contact with Canadian authorities, who are taking the necessary legal steps to decide the fate of the ship As for the crew, 49 Russian citizens are among those on board Because they are in the territory of a foreign state, they will receive all necessary consular and other assistance to protect their rights I repeat our Embassy is in touch with Canadians and with the representatives of the crew The issue is being solved judicially RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/nesterenko-briefing-arctic-problems/
"28 May, 2010","As Obama moves against homegrown terrorists, itâs time to read the fine print","The president s national security strategy focuses the big security guns on homegrown terrorism, but some observers fear the new program will ride roughshod over democratic terrain John Brennan, deputy national security adviser for counter terrorism and homeland security, said the document explicitly recognized the threat posed by individuals radicalized here at home  As was to be expected, the radicalized  were overwhelmingly identified as American Muslims, drawn astray by faraway terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban Brennan, speaking at Washington s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said America had to look beyond fighting sophisticated, 9/11 style attacks  We ve seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist activities or causes, he said We ve seen individuals, including US citizens, armed with their US passport, travel easily to terrorist safe havens and return to America, their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement  He stressed that the US was at war not with Islam but Al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates  In Washington s new security strategy, released Thursday, it is stressed that America s arch enemy continues to be Al Qaeda not Islam Indeed, Osama Bin Laden s terrorist organization was mentioned no less than 40 times throughout the 60 page security document We will always seek to delegitimize the use of terrorism and to isolate those who carry it out Yet this is not a global war against a tactic terrorism or a religion   Islam We are at war with a specific network, al Qa ida, and its terrorist affiliates who support efforts to attack the United States, our allies, and partners, the document read Several recent incidences of violent extremists in the United States who are committed to fighting here and abroad have underscored the threat to the United States and our interests posed by individuals radicalized at home  This description will instantly bring to mind a rogue s gallery of misguided thugs and crackpots, like Richard Shoe Bomber Reid, Umar Christmas Day Bomber Abdulmutallab, and finally, Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized US citizen of Pakistan decent who left an amateurishly rigged explosive device inside of his running car in Times Square on May 1 And who could forget Colleen Rosa, aka Jihad Jane, who got her 15 seconds of fiendish fame after she was busted for chatting with terrorists over the Internet? As a result of such security setbacks, The Federal Government will invest in intelligence to understand this threat and expand community engagement and development programs to empower local communities  Incidentally, the document never mentions the invasive powers awarded to the intelligence community through the Patriot Act, rammed through without appropriate debate by the Bush administration when America blinked after the devastating attacks of 9/11 Those extreme powers now belong to the Obama administration Ironically, Obama s new security strategy draws a disproportionate amount of attention to the Al Qaeda side of the US terror threat, yet some of America s most heinous acts of terrorism have been faithfully carried out by homegrown Christians Timothy McVeigh, for example, received the death penalty for detonating a truck bomb in front of a federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding scores more More recently, Andrew Joseph Stack, a disgruntled computer engineer and failed entrepreneur, flew his private aircraft into the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Austin, Texas, killing himself and an IRS employee Despite the obvious similarities albeit on a significantly smaller scale between Stack s desperate strategy and the attacks of 9/11, US officials refused to categorize the Austin attack as an act of terrorism A leading Muslim advocacy group petitioned government officials to call the suicide plane crash in Texas an act of terror,  arguing that if a Muslim had been flying the plane it would have immediately been labeled as such The argument is worthy of consideration Whenever an individual or group attacks civilians in order to make a political statement, that is an act of terror, Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), told The Hill, a Washington newspaper Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the faith, race or ethnicity of the perpetrator or the victims, Awad concluded On behalf of full media disclosure, it must be added that two Texas lawmakers did the right thing by calling the attack an act of terror Like the larger scale tragedy in Oklahoma City, this was a cowardly act of domestic terrorism, said Rep Lloyd Doggett (D Texas) in a statement And Rep Mike McCaul (R Texas), at a press conference following the crash, told a reporter that it sounds like [a terrorist attack] to me  But the Obama administration s new guidelines for hunting down terrorists at home go beyond the religious or political motivations of the suspects; increasingly, the war on homegrown terrorists comes down to a matter of law and justice for all Americans In aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Bush administration had little problem ramming through its (now) controversial US Patriot Act (the contrived acronym of this brutal crowbar into our private lives stands forUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001) The Patriot Act, as is already well known, dramatically increased the ability of the law enforcement agencies ability to search citizens telephone, e mail communications, medical, financial, and even library records, in addition to numerous other invasions big and small In his documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore bagged an interview with Senator John Conyers, Jr who candidly admitted that most of the lawmakers never even read the Patriot Act before passing it We don t really read most of the bills, Conyers confessed Do you know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed?  Conyers then answers his own rhetorical question, saying that if they did [read every bill] it would slow down the legislative process  And here is where the Bush era web of sabotage and intrigue weaves itself seamlessly into the Obama administration s sanitized version of the War on Terror: The Patriot Act expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism,  thus widening the number of activities to which the security agency s activities could be applied Since the net used for fishing out suspected terrorists has just widened significantly, it may do well to consider the subtle aspects of this new legislation First, Obama s new security strategy will help to silence some of his more vocal critics (read: Republicans), who regularly drag the Democrats over the coals for going soft on terrorists (by doing things that are considered de rigueur in democratic societies, like reading suspected criminals their Miranda Rights, and providing them with a lawyer to ensure that their legal rights do not get waived, as is presently happening with striking regularity) Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who just can t stay out of the headlines, had these hot words for the Obama administration following the failed Christmas Day incident last year As I ve watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war, the former vice president said He seems to think if he has a low key response to an attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people we won t be at war  Cheney then cited the administration s efforts to try the five alleged plotters of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in a civilian rather than a military court, and to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility   two things he is fiercely opposed to All of this raging rhetoric should make one sit up and wonder: What are the Republicans so afraid of? Is it simply a matter of them being afraid that the terrorists who are certainly the most fiercely guarded POWs in the history of warfare will conspire to make a jail break on US territory? Come on! Not even the fear mongering Republicans could possibly believe such a ridiculous thing Moreover, if the Neoconservatives were brave enough to send (not lead) US troops into the very hostile deserts of Afghanistan and Iraq, surely they can endure the traffic jams and security measures that such high profile trials would demand back home I mean, certainly they didn t think the War on Terror only involved lucrative military contracts and proximity to oil reserves, right? Maybe the Republicans are spooked by the hefty price tag that will come with trying suspected terrorists in one of our larger cities? This is equally implausible, since spending wads of taxpayer cash on the War on Terror has never stopped the Republicans before Think of all the handsome security contracts such a trial would bring? So what is it? What is making the seemingly fearless Republicans (and increasingly the Democrats, who are almost guaranteed to cave in and give all suspected terrorists military tribunals) tremble in their boots at the mere thought of offering legal rights to those individuals charged with acts of terrorism? Here is a theory: the alleged terrorists, in the (rare) event that their legal rights are not waived, may utter something in an open, civilian court that is extremely damaging to the war on terrorism Like, for example, they acted alone, as Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square would be bomber has declared Immediately after the Times Square bombing story broke, an assortment of outlets (most notably by the SITE Intelligence Group, which was responsible for releasing a video purporting to show the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud declaring his group s responsibility for the attack) scrambled to make a connection between Shahzad and terrorist organizations in Pakistan Yet Faisal Shahzad has gone on record as telling investigators that he acted alone In other words, it is highly possible that he was a lone wolf,  much like Andrew Stack, who flew his plane into the IRS building (an act, by the way, which did not result in drone missile attacks overseas) Even the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, a ragtag bunch of militants who have claimed responsibility in the past for lesser criminal acts carried out by others, denied any knowledge of Faisal Shahzad We have no relation with Faisal However, he is our Muslim brother, Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told the AP in Pakistan by telephone from an undisclosed location We feel proud of Faisal He did a brave job  Finally, David Petraeus, the US general who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, says the Times Square bombing suspect is a lone wolf  terrorist who did not work with others Despite all of the lingering doubts concerning Faisal Shahzad, not even the peace loving, Nobel Prize winning American president Barack Obama could restrain himself from unleashing a massive drone missile attack on suspected terrorist hideouts in Pakistan (a nuclear armed nation, by the way) several days after Shahzad s arrest There have been several drone missile strikes in North Waziristan since a failed attempt to detonate a car bomb on May 1 in New York, reported the Voice of America The attempted terrorist act has refocused international attention on the tribal region because the Pakistan born American citizen detained in connection with the incident has allegedly told US investigators he received training in the Waziristan region  The report quoted US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of warning Pakistan of serious consequences  if a successful terrorist attack on America is traced back to Pakistan Naturally, this puts Pakistan in a very uncomfortable position, and not unlike the one that Afghanistan found itself immediately after 9/11, when it was alleged that the Taliban was hosting the mastermind of the attacks, Osama Bin Laden, on their territory The Bush administration demanded that the Taliban hand over Bin Laden, while the Taliban demanded proof of his guilt for what transpired on 9/11 The rest of the story, of course, is War on Terror history But this leads us back to the question of providing legal rights for suspected terrorists At first, the very idea legal rights for terrorists  sounds noxious After all, why not just let them all rot to death in Guantanamo Bay, just like so many fear stricken Republicans are suggesting? Well, because the United States is a democracy, and it (should) go against our basic founding principles to endorse such behavior   yes, even when it comes to War on Terror detainees (By the way, perhaps it never occurred to some people that eventually our own troops will be POWs in foreign territory, and the enemy will consider how his own people are faring in our prisons when deciding what kind of conditions to provide for his prisoners) More importantly, since an increasing number of individuals and groups may be qualifying for official membership in the terrorist  club (that is, due to the very loose definition as to exactly whom could be considered a terrorist ), it would behoove us to make sure that the terrorists are receiving all of the appropriate legal rights Presently, however, there is a deeply disturbing trend of alleged terrorists falling into the black hole of the US justice system, never to be heard from again, except vicariously through the media mouthpiece Think about this: when was the last time you heard Richard Shoe Bomber  Reid, Umar Christmas Day Bomber  Abdulmutallab, and finally, Faisal Shahzad defend themselves in public, either by themselves or through their attorneys? Today, the debate is increasingly concerned not with providing these suspected terrorists with a fair, democratic trial, but whether or not it is desirable to provide these admittedly shady characters with legal representation (!) Days after his arrest, the Times Square bombing suspect has not been seen in court, though American law provides a right to be charged promptly before a magistrate, usually within 48 hours, The New York Times reported on May 6 But like a lot of legal rights, that one can be waived, the article said, perhaps a bit too nonchalantly Lawyers and former prosecutors said it could be some time anywhere from a little while to a long while before the suspect, Faisal Shahzad, who has been talking with prosecutors and investigators, stands in some baggy jail outfit before a judge It s not the normal course of things, but it s not unprecedented, said Daniel C Richman, a Columbia law professor who is a former federal prosecutor, as quoted by the NYT article There was no clear outer limit to how much time might pass before a court appearance, as long as Mr Shahzad properly waived his legal rights  Now we must ask ourselves: what would compel any suspected criminal to voluntarily waive his legal rights? What is leading these detainees to make such a decision? Are they being coerced to waive their rights on a regular basis? The question is an important one, because various anonymous government sources  should not be speaking on behalf of these individuals, who, for all intent and purposes, no longer have the ability to speak for themselves Finally, let s not forget that in the all too recent past the United States government, together with proxy states, was found guilty of extracting confessions from suspected terrorists through torture Since so many other aspects of the Bush administration are still in effect today ¦ In other words, the issue boils down to a matter of trust: should we trust the incriminating words that are being placed in the mouths of the incarcerated, which oftentimes lead to military attacks abroad? Or should we demand full legal rights for the incarcerated, so that the public may decide what is the right decision based on such facts? Simply uttering the word terrorist  has a magical way of shutting down all reasonable debate; the suspect suddenly descends into some sort of legal purgatory beyond the pale of democratic principles In our overwhelming zeal to perpetrate the evildoers, we are succumbing to behavior strikingly at odds with our democratic heritage Republican scaremongering tactics aside, the America people need to hear the full story from the mouths of these alleged terrorists, or at least their lawyers, and condemn the puppet play now going on behind the scenes But it is not only the suspected terrorists who are losing their rights If some members of US Congress get their way, it will be the defense lawyers too who get the short end of the legal stick Lawyers acting for Guantanamo Bay detainees such as Canada s Omar Khadr could find themselves targets of Pentagon and congressional investigations under proposed legislation, The Canadian Press reported on Wednesday The provision presently getting kicked around in Congress like an innocent beach ball would require the Pentagon s inspector general to probe lawyers where, among other things, there is reasonable suspicion that they have interfered with operations at the notorious prison A lawyer who violates any applicable policy of the Defense Department, or who generates any material risk to a member of the US Armed Forces, could also risk an investigation, the article stated Essentially, this comes down to harrassing lawyers who are trying to represent individuals who may or may not be guilty of the crimes they are accused of When I was in law school, I was taught in our professional responsibility class that the highest calling of a lawyer is to represent an unpopular client, said Barry Coburn, one of Khadr s civilian lawyers in Washington, DC, as quoted by The Canadian Press I don t think the government should attempt to punish or intimidate us for doing so  Khadr is scheduled to face trial by a military commission at Guantanamo Bay in August on charges he committed war crimes by throwing a hand grenade that killed an American soldier in Afghanistan in 2002 Khadr was 15 years old at the time of the attack The provision was introduced last week by Rep Jeff Miller, a fifth term Republican from Florida and a member of the Armed Services Committee Miller, in similar fashion to a host of other Republicans, has condemned an effort by the American Civil Liberties Union and National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers on behalf of Gitmo detainees as a treacherous enterprise  Miller also called some of the detainee lawyers disloyal  and accused them of breaking the law ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said Wednesday the proposed law would further undermine the already illegitimate Guantanamo military commissions  Carolyn Lamm, the president of the American Bar Association, called for the defeat of the amendments in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday The American system of justice, Lamm said, depends on zealous and effective counsel even to those accused of heinous crimes against this nation in the name of causes that evoke our contempt  This is not the first time lawyers defending terrorism suspects in the US have found themselves at risk of reprisal Earlier this year, US conservatives bad mouthed the Al Qaeda 7  a group of lawyers who represented terrorism detainees before being appointed to the US Justice Department In conclusion, President Obama s national security strategy appears to be a kinder, gentler approach to the War on Terror than was pursued during the Bush years It advocates working more closely with our allies (which may, however, be misconstrued in foreign capitals as a subtle order from Washington), as well as preserving democratic principles when carrying out foreign policy goals Gone is the unilateral hubris of yesteryear There are even several parts where America s new commitment to cooperation with China, India and Russia is endorsed, which would have looked odd just two years ago Yet, if we remove the glossy articulation and respectable tone of the new strategy document, strip it of its blinding gloss, we are left with a rattling machine that closely resembles a worn out model from the Bush era: Al Qaeda is mentioned incessantly, as is terrorism,  although the over abused phrase The War on Terror  has taken a backseat to the euphemistic overseas contingency operations  Meanwhile, US troops and their increasingly disillusioned allies are still fighting brutal battles in Iraq, Afghanistan, and, with alarming frequency, in Pakistan Most worrisome, the Obama administration remains frozen in its tracks over what to do with the suspected terrorists in its overseas contingency operations  Should these individuals be tried humanely and according to the dictates of international law, or cowardly and behind closed door military tribunals? And let s not forget that Barack Obama has still failed to hang a closed sign on Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp, which continues to imprison almost 200 prisoners under little more than gulag conditions And now the War on Terror is coming to a neighborhood near you And never before has it been more important for the American people whose civil liberties continue to be severely threatened despite a changing of the guard on Pennsylvania Avenue to demand a simple, yet increasingly endangered species: the full, unadulterated story in the ongoing War on Terror After all, the catchphrases may have become sanitized to suit the times, but the realities behind the shine remain the same Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/obama-homegrown-terrorists-read/

defense ministers is being held in Rome involving on the Russian side Sergey Lavrov and Anatoly Serdyukov This is the first meeting in a new format for Russian Italian relations the so called 2 plus 2, an agreement on the establishment of which was reached during the sixth round of bilateral top level consultations under the chairmanship of President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, and President of the Council of Ministers of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, on December 3, 2009 at Rome The creation within the bilateral dialogue framework of a new mechanism of in depth consultations on issues of international politics and security reflects the line of the leaders of the two countries on a comprehensive strengthening of the Russian Italian strategic partnership After the consultations, Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi plans to receive Lavrov for a conversation Lavrov and Serdyukov plan to describe in detail the outcome of the discussions in Rome at a joint press conference to be held during these hours An account will be placed on the websites of our ministries Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov on May 16 held talks with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait Mohammed Sabah Al Sabah, currently in Russia on a working visit Discussions focused mainly on the question of strengthening political interaction and co operation between Russia and Kuwait in various fields The parties examined a wide range of global and regional problems from the perspective of the tasks of creating a multipolar world order, bolstering international security and stability, achieving a political settlement of conflicts, and increasing counteraction against extremism, transnational terrorism and other challenges You can also acquaint yourself with detailed information about this meeting by visiting the Ministry website I would like to draw your attention to the speeches made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov during Government Hour in the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on May 13 and in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on May 19 In these speeches, Lavrov set forth to the parliamentarians the most urgent tasks now facing foreign policy He described the current processes in international affairs, and delineated Russian diplomacy objectives for the long term The minister also touched upon the main aspects of international diplomacy in the context of the development of Russian foreign policy, and answered numerous questions relating to the themes of his speeches More information is available at the Foreign Ministry site On May 22, 2010 in Tashkent, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov will attend a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Co operation Organization (SCO), which is to be held under the chairmanship of Uzbekistan The focus of the meeting will be the preparation for an upcoming SCO Council of Heads session in Tashkent in June At the same time the ministers will consider the drafts of a final declaration, and other documents and decisions of the summit The heads of the foreign affairs agencies will discuss topical regional and global issues, as well as further deepening the interaction of the SCO member states in international affairs Sergey Lavrov s meeting with members of the World Co ordination Council of Russian CompatriotsOn May 19, Sergey Lavrov, Chairman of the Government s Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, had a traditional meeting at the MFA Mansion with members of the World Co ordination Council of Russian Compatriots, which these days is holding a session in Moscow I was asked: Could you comment on the statement by Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite at the ceremony of bestowal of awards on the forest brethren  on May 14, in which the President asserted that the struggle of the so called partisans  not only slowed assimilation and destruction of national identity,  but also showed that Lithuania s joining the USSR voluntarily  was a myth?Such statements of Grybauskaite vividly illustrate the duality of Lithuanian politics How else can one explain the fact that, on the one hand, Vilnius offers numerous assurances of the willingness to develop pragmatic co operation with Russia in a spirit of mutual understanding and trust, and on the other, it undertakes attempts to exploit the issues of our common history and to foist a tendentious concept of Soviet occupation  on the civil societies of the two countries Lithuania must understand that it is impossible to build co operation with the Russian Federation on the desire to manipulate the historical memory to suit domestic political expediency With this approach of the Lithuanian leadership to the creation of a politico informational background of our interstate relations to talk about the prospects of achieving a qualitatively new level of Russian Lithuanian dialogue seems to be premature I would like to draw your attention to the Russian Foreign Ministry statement in connection with the pronouncement on May 17 of the ruling of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the case of Vasily Kononov I ll repeat once again that its contents are being carefully studied in Russia As you know, the website of the Ministry has hosted a special statement In our assessment, one can speak about a very dangerous precedent that causes us great concern We regard the verdict of the Grand Chamber not just as a revision of the fair ruling the Court Chamber in this case, handed down on July 24, 2008, but as an attempt to cast doubt on several key political and legal principles that emerged following World War II and the postwar arrangement in Europe, particularly with regard to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals Once again I will stress: we are sure that the Russian and international juridical community will have its weighty say in designating the legal consequences of the decision On May 19, the media commented extensively on the press conference at Interfax News Agency in which Tatiana Anodina, head of the Interstate Aviation Committee, gave clarifications regarding the work done by Russian and Polish specialists to decipher transcripts of the flight data recorders of the Polish President s plane that crashed near Smolensk on April 10, 2010 I can stress once again that a draft memorandum of understanding was transmitted to Warsaw on May 18 via diplomatic channels, the signing of which on behalf of the state commissions of Russia and Poland, and the Interstate Aviation Committee as an international body conducting an independent technical investigation of the causes of the air crash near Smolensk on April 10 will make it possible to resolve the issues of a transfer to the Polish side at its request of copies of the transcripts of the flight data recorders of the Republic of Poland Tu 154M plane, airframe 101, with regard to a number of restrictions related to the norms of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and to the ICAO regulations I ll stress that the work on the memorandum with the Polish partners is proceeding vigorously We presume that this tripartite document can be agreed upon in a short space of time and, accordingly, the procedure for transfer of copies of the transcripts of the decoded cockpit voice recorders will be held in the near future We hope in co operation with the Polish side to do so during May I have been asked: How can the Russian Foreign Ministry comment on the report by Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State and head of the Group of Wise Men, on NATO s new Strategic Concept, which she submitted on May 17 at NATO headquarters in Brussels? We will carefully study the detailed report prepared by the Albright led group at the direction of the NATO Secretary General with recommendations for NATO s new Strategic Concept, which is expected to be endorsed at the Alliance summit in Lisbon in November this year Our preliminary analysis of the document leaves a dual impression On the one hand, it contains a lot of constructive ideas for a Euro Atlantic system of co operative security, the adequate embedding of NATO in a scheme of international efforts at peacekeeping and responding to modern challenges and threats based on the recognition of the role of the UN and international law and a rational division of labor  with the EU, OSCE, CSTO, SCO and other existing security structures It is proposed to more clearly define the objectives of NATO as a regional organization which does not seek the functions of a global policeman  and does not aspire to leadership in non core areas of security An important statement by the example of Afghanistan that military means cannot achieve a long term post conflict stabilization, and that an integrated effort is needed with emphasis on political and socio economic assistance, involving all key players It is these points that have been discussed repeatedly by us with our partners in NATO, and this was also the focus of the conversations with the Group of Wise Men in Moscow in February this year, of which we informed you in detail We note the recommendations in the report for a qualitative improvement of relations with Russia through the strengthening of mutual trust and by the expansion of partnership based on common security interests: Afghanistan, missile defense, arms control, crisis response, and the struggle against terrorism, piracy, the proliferation of WMD and drug trafficking For our part, we have always stressed our commitment to open dialogue in the Russia NATO Council on problematic issues and to a sustained buildup of mutually beneficial partnerships with the NATO countries in countering the real challenges to stability in the Euro Atlantic space However, it has not escaped our attention that the report also includes a number of prejudiced clichÃ©s from another era, in our judgment, with regard to our country Apparently, some members of the Group of Wise Men find difficulty realizing the changes that have occurred in the world since the end of Cold War and the priorities of contemporary Russia Hence the clearly unjustified from the view of common sense, and the realities of today, hyperbolization of the defensive  functions of the alliance under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty The suggestions for NATO to maintain a free hand in deciding on the use of its military capabilities, or acting according to the situation,  including outside its traditional sphere of responsibility, also raise questions The report s formula of the anti NATO focus of the Russian initiative for a European Security Treaty, despite the many clarifications given by us in this regard, likewise cannot but evoke surprise We hope that in further work on the draft of NATO s new Strategic Concept the mindset will prevail for transformations in the alliance which would serve the interests of strengthening stability and predictability in politico military affairs, building a common space of indivisible security in the Euro Atlantic area, and co operating more effectively in responding to the real common challenges and threats This would benefit all I would like to draw attention to the news reports concerning the draft of a so called UN Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran  I can only direct you to our position on this matter, as detailed in the press release on the MFA site about the outcome of the telephone conversation between Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held on May 18 The heads of the foreign affairs agencies of the two countries had a thorough exchange of views on the situation surrounding the Iranian nuclear program, particularly with regard to the Declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Iran and Turkey signed in Tehran on May 17, with suggestions for resolving the issue of swapping Iran s low enriched uranium for fuel for the Tehran research reactor The Minister and the Secretary of State exchanged views on the impact that this move could have on the preparation of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iran The Russian side confirmed that the principled understanding achieved within the 5 +1  group on the draft resolution remains valid and that, at the next phase, work is to be continued in the Security Council already, where the nonpermanent Security Council members will have the opportunity to express their attitude towards the draft It was also noted that at the same time a thorough analysis of the post declaration situation has to be carried out, particularly in terms of the need for Iran to act speedily to comply with its provisions, primarily through a formal application to the IAEA Lavrov drew attention to the document s assessment given by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference in Kiev on May 17, and stressed that agreeing on generally acceptable ways to implement the Brazil Turkey initiative would help establish a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of politico diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue as a whole The full text of the press release on the outcome of this telephone conversation is posted on the MFA website RIA Novosti asked me a clarification question: The draft of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iran has a paragraph about embargo on the supply of missiles Is it about offensive or defensive missiles or all types of missiles? Will that resolution, if adopted, mean the end of Russia s plans to supply S 300 systems to Iran? If you show me such a draft resolution, I'll be ready to comment on it Concerning how the situation is evolving with regard to the UN Security Council I again draw your attention to the telephone conversation between Lavrov and Clinton Signed in Kiev on May 17, 2010, the Joint Statement of the Presidents of the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Transdniestrian settlement has, as anticipated, attracted international attention The document articulated the vision by the states acting as mediators and guarantors of a just and comprehensive settlement of the problem, of the basic principles for continued search of a political compromise and noted the key factors designed to ensure stability in the region Against a background of stalled efforts to restore mutual understanding between Chisinau and Tiraspol, the clear position statement provides a timely and significant contribution to the consolidation of international mediation in this regard By all appearances, the Moldovan side had beforehand disposed itself to receive the signal from Kiev skeptically, openly expressing doubts as to whether the statement would have a political and legal impact on the process of conflict resolution Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat s official comment on May 18 boiled down to just this: Moldova is ready to immediately engage in constructive negotiations with the Transdniestrians in an international format, and regards the beginning of consultations on the transformation of the regional peacekeeping operation and removal of the Russian contingent in the conflict zone as the main condition Indeed, the fact that a settlement can only be achieved in the negotiations between the parties to the conflict, and that the elaboration of a special and reliably guaranteed status for Transdniestr is expected in this context, which, in turn, will prompt an international peace guaranteeing format to replace the current peacekeeping one, is confirmed by the formulations of the Kiev document We would not like to think that behind the striking slogans to reach an immediate agreement about everything  is hidden the intention to put pressure on the opponent, and not to negotiate on equal terms Since the spring of 2006, the conditions have not yet been restored for even the resumption of the consultation format Permanent Conference on political issues within the framework of the Transdniestrian negotiation process The politico constitutional crisis on the right bank of the Dniester, the ambiguous statements by Moldovan political leaders about the future orientation of the country, and the absence of the settlement model itself dramatically weaken the prerequisites for mutual accommodation of the conflicting parties The Russian Federation bases its mediation in resolving the Transdniestrian problem on the continuity of the agreements reached in the negotiation process and on the observance of the international principles of settlement It has always been interested in restoring the territorial integrity of Moldova and strengthening its sovereignty and constitutional neutrality The fact that these positions are fully shared by the state leadership of Ukraine enhances the prospects of achieving a sustainable political Dniester region settlement A plenary meeting was held in Brussels on May 19 to sum up the work done in the ninth round of negotiations on a New Russia EU Framework Agreement The parties were generally appreciative of the current negotiation phase in terms of the momentum and the overall focus on the result, which should fully reflect the interests of both Russia and the EU Evaluation of the talks on the Framework Agreement is included in the agenda of the Russia EU summit at Rostov on Don (31 MayÂ  1 June) It was arranged to hold the next, tenth round of negotiations in June and July This year's economic forum in St Petersburg will be held on June 17 19 Its keynote theme will be modernization: how Russia and other countries are going to seize the opportunities that the crisis has provided for the modernization of national and world economies By tradition, the President of the Russian Federation will open the forum with his speech French President Nicolas Sarkozy is scheduled to speak on the second day of the forum The discussions will involve the leaders of the world's largest companies, leading experts and heads of bodies of state power in Russia and other countries To date, participation has been confirmed by heads of companies in the most diverse industries: energy, manufacturing, high technology, the financial sector and consulting Among them: Total, BP, ENI, Shlumberger, BHP Bilton, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Alcoa, Daimler AG, Siemens, Intel, Cisco, Telenor, Nestle, Unilever and others, and the leaders of all major auditing firms Topics of panel discussions are devoted to the global problems of the world economy, the Russian specificity, as well as analysis of the future in the sphere of high technology in terms of its impact on the economy and business There will be held discussions on the most diverse themes ranging from changes in investment policy for the largest sovereign funds and the future of the markets for telecommunications and alternative energy, to new models of the formation and construction of the cultural environment of cities A number of sector specific discussions will be held as business lunches This year they will be devoted inter alia to the pharmaceutical industry and global market audit The Business Dialogues: Russia USA, Russia CIS, Russia European Union, and Russia India are organized Traditionally the heads the world's largest energy companies will meet in a panel discussion This year it will focus on the future of the global gas market For a discussion of the Russian theme, some of the activities of the forum will be held in a fundamentally new format briefings this year During the briefings, Cabinet members and leading experts will interact with the audience, explaining the changes that take place in Russia as part of the construction of the Customs Union and improvements in immigration and budgetary policies There was a question from Channel One: How does Moscow evaluate the dialogue with the United States on adoption, including the outcome of the meeting of the Russian US working group on the question of concluding a treaty governing international adoption? We believe that the dialogue on issues of adoption is proceeding in a constructive manner There have been two rounds of consultation (on April 29 and May 12 14), a joint working group of experts has been set up and has already begun to harmonize the provisions of the draft bilateral adoption agreement submitted by the Russian side Most important, the parties have managed to reach a common understanding of the need to change the status quo in this area by adopting a legally binding treaty, which would reliably guarantee the rights, life and health of foster children It is about the regulation of adoption agencies, guarantees of free consular access to foster families, the preservation of the original nationality of children, and the determination in Russia and the US of central authorities responsible for the implementation of a future agreement The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education and Science and other concerned Russian agencies proceed from the assumption that it should be prepared as soon as possible This approach is shared by the American experts It was arranged to hold the next round of consultations in Washington in the first half of June In view of the media inquiries coming in to the Ministry, I would like to comment on the steps being taken to resolve the case  of B T Hobert, a former school teacher at the German Embassy, who became responsible for the road traffic accident in Moscow on November 30, 2008, which killed two Russian citizens: A V Yevteyev and A G Kamynin On April 30, O E Kamynina, mother of Aleksandr Kamynin who died in the accident, forwarded an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the decision of Germany s Munster Court of November 10, 2009, giving Hobert a one year suspended sentence, a ban on driving for one month and a fine of 5,000 euros The lawsuit aims to ensure the injured parties' rights to a fair and public hearing and to life under Articles 6 and 2 of the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of November 4, 1950 The injured parties used the opportunity and their inalienable right of recourse to international courts due to the fact that the verdict of the Munster court is final and cannot be appealed within the framework of the legal system of Germany The German Federal Office of Justice had formally notified the Russian Prosecutor General's Office of this in response to its inquiry We believe that the ECHR s consideration of the Hobert case  does not encompass another important aspect of a just settlement of the consequences of this tragic incident: reasonably compensating the victims' families for moral damage We want this solved in the spirit of a humanitarian gesture  of the German side, in line with the understanding reached by Sergey Lavrov with German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the talks in Moscow on November 20, 2009, and confirmed at the meeting in Berlin on February 5 this year The initiative of German insurance company Allianz, which has insured Hobert s auto civil liability, to resolve the issue of compensation out of court by negotiating an amicable agreement  with the families affected is being considered in this context The Russian Foreign Ministry will continue to work through diplomatic channels to provide the bereaved families with necessary assistance for a quick finalization with the German side of the acceptable to them and fair terms of an amicable agreement  on compensation, which would fully take into account the humanitarian aspect of the question We intend to continue to keep you informed about the further development of this situation RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021

"6 Apr, 2010",âRussia is grateful for the words of sympathyâ,"Moscow is deeply touched by the condolences offered by countries from around the world following the terrorist attacks on the Moscow Metro on March 29, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrey Nesterenko In his weekly media briefing, the official also commentated on some recent foreign policy developments, including Russia joining the UN security sanctions against North Korea and Russia s stance on Iran s nuclear efforts RT presents the full transcript of Andrey Nesterenko s briefing from April 1, 2010 Following the tragic events in Moscow on Monday, March 29, messages of condolence and telegrams flowed in from heads of state and government, leaders of international organizations and foreign political figures to the leadership of our country over these inhuman acts of terrorism Moscow is deeply moved by the compassion and support shown on this tragic day for the Russian people and appreciates the strong condemnation by the international community of any manifestations of terrorism Information about the victims of the terrorist acts in the Moscow subway on March 29, 2010 is available on the Emercom website (www mchs gov ru) According to reports, the bombings killed two Tajik citizens and injured several other foreign nationals The injured Malaysian students have already checked out of hospital according to our information A female citizen of the Philippines was also discharged from hospital The Russian Foreign Ministry expresses its heartfelt condolences to the victims families and loved ones, and wishes a speedy recovery for those injured A telephone conversation took place on March 31, 2010 between Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on his initiative Anders Fogh Rasmussen during the conversation expressed condolences on behalf of the Alliance over the terrorist attacks committed in Moscow on March 29 Topical issues in Russian NATO relations were also discussed Moscow took note of the speech by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen at the Brussels Forum on security on March 27 It contained some new ideas as to how to build qualitatively new relations with Russia and ensure indivisible security in the Euro Atlantic area The Secretary General s ideas are being studied We note in particular the approaches for cooperation in missile defense In fact, the Secretary General recalled Russia s 2002 initiative to securely protect our countries from missile risks through joint efforts Unfortunately, the relevant study by the Russia NATO Council Working Group on TMD had actually ground to a halt following adoption by the former US administration of a course towards constructing a third GMD site in the Czech Republic and Poland We agree with the thesis of the Secretary General that Europe should play a more active role in the anti missile dialogue of Russia and the US That Europeans should have the deciding vote as to which method of ensuring European security is most preferable and effective Our proposals on this score are well known First complete a joint appraisal of missile challenges and then devise methods to prevent such challenges from developing into real missile threats The existence of missile systems in third countries per se does not mean the existence of threats to Europe Hence to start with a military technical response when the other ways of influence have not been exhausted seems premature Moreover, there is a danger that the development of missile defense systems could, on the contrary, stimulate missile proliferation and lead to an arms race It is well known that the improvement of offensive weapons outpaces the development of defensive means However, we support the idea of forging equal and mutually beneficial antimissile co operation, particularly in situations where it will be deemed necessary by all countries concerned Such work was already done in the Russia NATO Council as part of the joint TMD research We regard positively the principles set out by Anders Fogh Rasmussen to build a possible pan European missile defense system set up, develop and run it on a collective basis One can only add that such a system must correspond to the level of real missile threats to Europe, and be created without compromising the security of other countries On March 26, 2010, the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers met in Moscow for a regular session It was chaired by Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister of Russia as the country presiding over the Commonwealth this year Detailed information on the outcome of the meeting is available on the Russian MFA website The second ministerial meeting of the Arctic Ocean coastal states Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States took place in Chelsea, a suburb of Ottawa, on March 29 It was attended by Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov The meeting discussed the situation in the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic region as a whole in light of the new opportunities and challenges stemming from climate change and the progress of technology It noted the special responsibility of the Arctic states for the state of affairs in the region The parties reaffirmed their adherence to the Ilulissat Declaration, adopted at their first meeting in May 2008, including a pledge to deal with all possible issues through negotiation based on the existing and sufficient international legal framework The five states reiterated their invariable support of the Arctic Council, which, along with the Barents Euro Arctic Council, is the central regional intergovernmental organization for cooperation in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development in the Arctic A detailed exchange of views took place on the concrete areas of developing multilateral Arctic cooperation Sergey Lavrov informed the meeting about an international Arctic forum The Arctic is a Territory of Dialogue  to be held in Moscow on April 22 23 under the aegis of the Russian Geographical Society, and expressed the hope that the five Arctic powers will take part More detailed information about the ministerial meeting, including the Chair s summary, is posted on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov on March 29 met with Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting He also had a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada Relevant information is posted on the Ministry website On April 4 7, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Colombia, Jaime Bermudez, will pay an official visit to Russia, to be held in the year of Colombia s bicentennial and the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Russian Colombian diplomatic relations During the visit he is scheduled to hold talks with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in which they are to exchange views on topical issues of the international, regional and bilateral agenda Following talks with Minister Lavrov a joint statement is planned to be adopted The aim of the visit is more intense political dialogue between our two countries, and the practical advancement of mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields It is proposed to strengthen the juridical base of bilateral relations A Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Colombia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and a Memorandum on Cooperation in the Field of Physical Culture and Sports between the Ministry of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of the Russian Federation and the Colombian Institute of Sport of the Republic of Colombia are ready for signing Colombia is one of Russia s important partners in Latin America and the international arena The level of contact between the two countries has been steadily increasing Regular and trustful is their high and summit level political dialogue A firm foundation for this is the similarity or identity of the positions of our countries on most key issues of our time, which makes it possible to work closely in their solution within the UN and other international organizations The Foreign Minister will pay a visit to Ukraine on April 9 10, during which the third meeting of the Russia Ukraine Interstate Commission s Subcommittee on International Cooperation headed by Sergey Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Konstantin Grishchenko is scheduled to be held Within this Subcommittee, six sub commissions have been created and are working: on cooperation in combating new challenges and threats; settlement of regional conflicts; the Azov Kerch settlement; border and consular issues; and cooperation in international organizations The meeting of the Subcommittee will substantively examine all matters within the competence of these sub commissions In addition, the heads of the foreign affairs agencies intend to discuss other topical issues of bilateral cooperation, major international problems, particularly European security issues, and the course of the Transdniestran conflict settlement process The upcoming meeting of Lavrov and Grishchenko the third in the past two months bears testimony to the active political dialogue between Russia and Ukraine Currently, preparations are underway for the sixth meeting of the Interstate Commission s Committee on Economic

outstanding issues on the basis of mutual benefit The tenth meeting in the framework of international discussions on security and stability in Transcaucasia took place in Geneva on March 30 It was attended by delegations of the Republic of Abkhazia, Georgia, the Russian Federation, the United States and the Republic of South Ossetia and by representatives of the EU, UN and OSCE Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Grigory Karasin headed the Russian delegation The delegations of Abkhazia, Russia and South Ossetia called attention to the need to confirm the nonuse of force commitments in treaty form The Russian side submitted its draft of the document It was emphasized that the activities of the joint incident prevention and response mechanisms are making a real contribution to strengthening stability and security in Transcaucasia and that it is important to ensure their smooth work Principled assessments were given to Tbilisi s attempts to popularize a certain strategy on occupied territories  and to the provocative actions of the Georgian TV channel Imedi The next meeting is scheduled for June 8, 2010, in Geneva I was asked how the Foreign Ministry could comment on the outcome of the trip by a delegation headed by PACE Monitoring Committee Chairman Dick Marty to the North Caucasus The Chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Rapporteur of the PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights Dick Marty visited Moscow and the North Caucasus region from March 22 to 28 in preparation, tentatively for the June session of the Assembly, of a report on Legal remedies for human rights violations in the North Caucasus region  Representatives of federal and regional authorities gave the Rapporteur special attention, since the Russian Federation fully agrees with the approach of the Monitoring Committee to the effect that in all member states of the European Convention on Human Rights, each resident should be able to defend their rights in a peaceful manner, and that justice should be swift, independent and competent During the visit Dick Marty met with Aleksandr Khloponin, Presidential Representative in the North Caucasus Federal District; Vladimir Lukin, Human Rights Ombudsman of the Russian Federation; Konstantin Kosachev, Head of the Federal Assembly Delegation to PACE; senior Prosecutor General s Office, FSB and Federal Penitentiary Service officials; Ramzan Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic; Yunus Bek Yevkurov, President of the Republic of Ingushetia; Magomedsalam Magomedov, President of Dagestan; Ella Pamfilova, Chairperson of the Presidential Council for the Promotion of Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights; and heads of ministries and representatives of the human rights community of the North Caucasian republics We noted the remark by Dick Marty that the members of the PACE delegation had visited Russia as representatives of the pan European family, not as judges This suggests that the forthcoming report will be objective and aimed at assisting the Russian Federation in resolving the complicated problems of the region, and will not give any reason for their politicization The 34th plenary meeting of the CIS Inter Parliamentary Assembly will be held in St Petersburg on April 7 to discuss mainly the question of the social and legal protection of Great Patriotic War veterans and home front workers As part of the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the IPA is holding an International Parliamentary Conference in St Petersburg on April 7 to mark the anniversary in which the speakers of the parliaments of the CIS member states will take part (participation of Western parliamentarians and leaders of international parliamentary organizations is also anticipated) The conference is expected to adopt an appropriate declaration On April 8, the CIS IPA and PACE are jointly conducting an international parliamentary conference in St Petersburg on the theme of The Future of European Security  Before the briefing I received the following question from RIA Novosti news agency On March 30, Russia joined the UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea What concrete restrictions against Pyongyang will the decree of the President of Russia entail? Why was it signed almost a year after the adoption of the relevant UNSC resolution, and what effect will its signing have on the prospects of resuming the six party talks on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula? In this regard, my answer is, ever since the adoption of UNSCR 1874, the Russian Federation has strictly adhered to the sanctions regime against the DPRK as prescribed by this document As to President Dmitry Medvedev s decree of March 27, 2010, its adoption is a purely internal Russian procedure, carried out in accordance with our legislation Preparatory work for the presidential decree called for thorough interagency approvals based legal expert assessments by various Russian ministries and departments, which took several months Russia presumes that the sanctions against the DPRK have not been imposed forever, and may be revised or revoked in the case of real progress in denuclearizing the Korean peninsula The relevant provisions regarding the procedures for changing the sanctions regime are contained in the UNSC resolution We firmly believe that a political solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear problem can and should be found within the Six Party Talks involving China, DPRK, ROK, Russia, the US and Japan We call for an early resumption of the negotiations I was asked how the Russian Foreign Ministry can comment on the results of the parliamentary elections in Iraq and how it assesses the prospects for a peaceful transfer of power in Baghdad Recall that we have already given our assessments in connection with the parliamentary elections held in Iraq on March 7 In this case, we proceeded from the opinion of the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq (IHEC) and of international observers that the vote was held without substantial irregularities We consider the subsequent differences between the various Iraqi political groupings over the vote count an internal affair of Iraq We expect that, acting within the legal field in strict accordance with national legislation, the Iraqis will be able to overcome those problems and to form a new government, and other governing bodies without delay, which will make it possible to move to searching for answers based on broad dialogue to the complicated questions on the internal agenda in the interest of ensuring national unity and consolidating sovereignty and territorial integrity I was asked to comment on the statement of the US Helsinki Commission on the explosions in the Moscow Metro, which says in part that the architects of Russia s North Caucasus policy don t ride the Metro  and that the terrorist attack serves as a cry for help to end the violence and poverty in Chechnya and neighboring regions  In this regard, my answer is this We are familiar with the statement of Senator Benjamin Cardin and Congressman Alcee Hastings, made by them as Co Chairs of the US Congress Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki Commission We are grateful for the words of sympathy and solidarity for the citizens of Russia However, the press release sets forth clumsy and totally irrelevant arguments that do not merit comment Let us leave on the authors conscience these profound conclusions  that run counter to the opinion of the entire world community, whose representatives, including US President Barack Obama, have expressed their deepest sympathy and unequivocally stated that there can be no explanation or justification for such barbaric acts of terrorism I would like to hope that Congressmen Cardin and Hastings will do some work with their speechwriters and in the future will be more responsible in making public assessments on issues affecting the feelings of millions of people Concerning the incident with the ship of the Navy of the Republic of Korea in the Yellow Sea As you know a powerful explosion, in unascertained circumstances, sank the South Korean Navy ship Chonan off the island of Baengnyeong in the Yellow Sea on March 26 So far, more than 40 crew members remain missing Expressing sympathy to the Korean side, we hope that the competent agencies of the ROK will conduct a professional and objective investigation, the results of which will make it possible to fully clear up the circumstances of this tragedy Russia joined the international operation in Haiti on January 14 when a search and rescue team and an airmobile hospital were sent to the epicenter of the disaster On the request of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a Russian Emercom Il 76 plane transferred a search and rescue helicopter Eurocopter Bk 117 (Global Reach Technology) to the disaster area Two Emercom Il 76 planes also provided transportation of essential goods to Port au Prince from Caracas (Venezuela s humanitarian aid) and from Panama (from the reserves of the European Union) The Russian rescuers saved nine people, including two children; searched 230 houses, three schools and a university on an area of 80 sq km; 395 Haitians received medical treatment that included 67 surgical operations; 469 people received psychological support; the aircraft flew 21 flights, ensuring the delivery of humanitarian supplies from the countries of the region, including the delivery of 60 tons of relief cargo from Caracas In coordination with the UN, the operation of the search and rescue team was wrapped up on January 21 and of the mobile hospital in early February Emercom spent $5 million on the conduct of this operation Through the UN World Food Program (WFP), Russia allocated $4 2 million for food aid to the people of Haiti We provided another $1 8 million to the International Civil Defense Organization (ICDO) for reconstruction work In addition, Russia allocated $1 million to the Children s Fund (UNICEF) for aid to Haitian child quake victims and $1 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) for assistance in the field of health care These figures were announced by the Russian representative in the course of the Donors Conference for Haiti, held in New York on March 31 The signing ceremony of an Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the International Atomic Energy Agency to Establish a Reserve of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) on Russian Territory took place on March 29 at the Vienna International Center The document was signed by the Director General of the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom, Sergey Kirienko, and IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano The LEU reserve of 120 tonnes to be located as per agreement at the International Uranium Enrichment Center in Angarsk sufficient to produce fuel for two full loads for a typical 1,000 megawatt pressurized water reactor will be available to potential buyers in just a few months Those eligible will be member states of the Agency having an agreement with the IAEA for the application of its safeguards to all of their peaceful nuclear activities and observing their nonproliferation undertakings The agreement opens the way for creating a sustainable IAEA system of nuclear fuel supply guarantees, giving confidence to member states in the practicability and stability of their plans to expand nuclear energy use for peaceful purposes Its conclusion ahead of the NPT Review Conference opening in May will contribute to the successful holding of this major international forum and facilitate strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime TV Channel Russia 24 asked me the following question The construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline is beginning this week How fast is it planned to be completed and what will that signify for Russia? My answer is, the commencement of gas supplies to Europe through the first line of Nord Stream is scheduled for 2011 In accordance with the plans of Nord Stream AG, both its lines will come into full operation in November 2012 I would like to note that Nord Stream is not a Russian, but a pan European project This is evidenced by its status as a priority energy project of the EU (Trans European NetworkÂ  TEN), which was obtained in 2000 and confirmed by the European Commission in 2006 The composition of Nord Stream AG shareholders (Russia s Gazprom with 51 per cent of the shares, Germany s Wintershall Holding and E ON Ruhrgas 20 per cent each, and the Netherlands Gasunie 9 per cent) is another testimony France s GDF Suez, with a share of 9 per cent, is planning to join the project before April this year The construction of the gas pipeline will make it possible to diversify the routes for transporting Russian gas to European countries and to reduce transit risks which currently exert a significant impact on the reliability of energy supplies to Europe The newspaper Gazeta asked me to comment on Russia s intention to apply to the UN for an extension of its continental shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk As is known, the application for an extension of Russia s continental shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk was part of the overall submission of the Russian Federation for the establishment of the outer limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, made by our country to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in 2001 In respect of the part of the submission concerning the Sea of Okhotsk, the Commission made a number of recommendations, based on which Russia is preparing a renewed application with regard to this area of the World Ocean The application itself is a scientific justification of the belonging of the bottom of the central part of the Okhotsk Sea to the Russian shelf If the Commission finds the scientific justification as set out in the application sufficient and adopts positive recommendations concerning our renewed submission pertaining to the Sea of Okhotsk, then in line with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, the Russian Federation will be able to establish on the basis of these recommendations in this area its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles the boundaries of which will be mandatory for other states, as well as to extend its exploration and development rights for non living resources to this space The Foreign Ministry, our Embassy in Washington and Consulate General in New York keep the case of the death in the US last August of the adopted child Ivan Skorobogatov (Nathaniel Craver) under constant control We maintain close working contacts with the US Justice Department Its representatives have assured us of their special attention to this inquiry According to them, the prosecutor s office has enough material on the whole to prove the guilt of the adoptive parents At the same time we were warned that the trial would be long, perhaps lasting more than a year A preliminary hearing has been postponed at the request of counsel for the accused from March 31 to April 29, 2010 Also being studied is the role of the US agency through which the adoption of Ivan Skorobogatov was processed The company in 2005 was deprived of registration and the right to work in Russia Representatives of the Russian Consulate General in New York visited Pennsylvania where they met with officials from local law enforcement agencies and bodies for the social protection of children A meeting was held with Ivan s sister, who was adopted at the same time with him Darya Skorobogatova The girl, who now lives with the parents of the adoptive father, goes to elementary school and is regularly examined by doctors We have succeeded in getting the temporary guardians of Darya to obtain a new Russian passport for her We are seeking an assurance from the American side that the consideration of this tragic case will be objective and that those guilty will not escape liability, as this, unfortunately, has occurred in similar cases before, and will suffer a deserved punishment We are also raising the question on the political level that a bilateral agreement be concluded which would actually protect adopted Russian children and guarantee their safety and lives I was asked to comment on reports of the return to Tatyana Denisova of her son Maksim by the Netherlands authorities Maksim has returned to his mother thanks to the meeting Denisova on March 29 had in Eindhoven s Council for Protection of the Rights of the Child in which a representative of the Russian Embassy in the Netherlands participated The Council took the decision, subject to court approval tentatively in mid April, on the basis of the results of its investigation, taking into account the mutual desire of mother and son to be together The Council also recommended appointing a guardian who will oversee the family for one year All this time Maksim will be with his mother and to put him back in an orphanage will be possible only by court order Tatyana Denisova is being given legal support (a lawyer provided) and the necessary consular assistance from the Russian Embassy in the Netherlands News agencies have reported today about the re establishment of the Hill of Honor memorial in Armenia In this regard, I want to say the following Work is currently underway in the Armenian city of Gyumri on rebuilding the Hill of Honor memorial at the burial site of Russian army officers It will be a replica of the obelisk to Russian soldiers by sculptor B Mikeshin, erected in 1910 in Kars The nearby Church of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker is being reconstructed Question: US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said today that consultations of the Iran Six on sanctions against that country will begin in the next few weeks The US Ambassador to the UN told reporters that China has agreed to start the consultations What are Russia s intentions in this respect and has our position changed on the Iranian nuclear problem? Answer: Our position on the situation around the Iranian nuclear program remains unchanged We advocate a political and diplomatic settlement of the problem We do not believe in the effectiveness of sanctions pressure for an overall resolution of the situation, but sometimes you have to resort to this tool in order to induce Tehran to show more constructiveness on the negotiation front This is the basis for our work in the Six within the framework of a double track approach, to which, as repeatedly stated, we remain committed However, we remain convinced that the use of sanctions should be approached carefully and proportionately, depending on the degree of cooperation from Iran, and not closing the door to further dialogue In addition, it is necessary that the sanctions should be smart  that is, not have the character of indiscriminate use and an all inclusive punishment of an entire country Such measures, if resorted to, should be focused, pinpointed and aim at strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime Question: Eduard Kokoity said that he has information about Georgia preparing terrorist groups to commit terrorist acts in South Ossetia and elsewhere in the North Caucasus How can you comment on that? Answer: I will refrain from commenting on statements by the South Ossetian head of state I think you have a possibility to get more detailed information on this subject from Eduard Kokoity himself Question: I have a clarification question Will the UN Security Council really start discussing sanctions against Iran soon? Answer: We must await work in the UN Security Council The practice of this UN body is to hold preliminary consultations involving all of its members, both permanent and nonpermanent Let us wait for the beginning of this process to discuss possible proposals from those pushing for this idea, and then we will see how the situation develops Our position was set out in the comment that I made a few minutes ago We proceed from this and will stick to these arguments in discussions with our Security Council partners Question: How can the Ministry comment on the outcome of the visit to Moscow by Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius? Answer: At the invitation of the Rostropovich Foundation, Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius was on a private visit to Moscow on March 26 27 He had a conversation on March 26 with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin The heads of government of Russia and Lithuania exchanged views on further ways to strengthen trade, economic and investment cooperation, especially in energy, transport and agriculture They also touched on issues relating to expansion of the juridical base of relations and considered in detail the problems associated with operations in the Kaliningrad Region RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/terrorism-foreign-ministry/

Yanukovich towards solving the backlog of acute bilateral issues Moscow stands ready for full blown, comprehensive co operation with Ukraine on the principles of pragmatism and mutual benefit, the revitalization of the Russian Ukrainian Interstate Commission led by the presidents of the two countries and its working bodies in various areas of co operation, and a detailed discussion of the

operation between Russia and Sweden could be called after the meeting of President Medvedev with Prime Minister Reinfeldt In these talks, they substantively discussed the basic guidelines for creating an active partnership with Sweden in the task of modernizing the Russian economy and of transferring it to an innovative path of development The following were identified as the most promising areas

The heads of the foreign affairs agencies discussed the course of the implementation of the agreements reached between the leaderships of our countries, and a number of topical issues in Russian Finnish cooperation, including a schedule of upcoming political contacts Themes relating to the constructive interaction of Russia and Finland in the framework of international and regional entities in the Baltic area, northern Europe and the Arctic were thoroughly examined Considerable attention was paid to discussing international issues with an emphasis on security problems in the Euro Atlantic space and on the Russian initiative for a European Security Treaty, on Russian relations with the EU, including work on a new framework agreement and advancement towards visa free travel for citizens, as well as on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation themes An exchange of views was held on a number of regional questions, including the situations in Afghanistan and the Middle East

further strengthening and development of mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation and interaction in political, trade, economic, cultural, educational, and other fields Minister Lavrov is expected to meet with President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov and to hold talks with Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov It is borne in mind to discuss prospects for expanding mutually beneficial economic ties, augmenting trade and reinvigorating cooperation between Russia s regions and Turkmenistan Due attention will be paid to the development of interaction in education and culture and to the implementation of existing bilateral agreements in this field There will be an exchange of views on topical international problems, the situation in Central Asia and the deepening of cooperation

Quartet ministerial meeting There will also be a bilateral part to the program of her visit, including a scheduled meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov The ministers will take stock of the efforts to strengthen bilateral practical collaboration, particularly within the Russian American Presidential Commission, and identify priority thrust areas for near term Russian US cooperation In the cluster of politico military issues, they will pay close attention to the advancement of the negotiation process in Geneva to craft a new SOA treaty, as well as discuss co ordination of Russian American efforts on the non proliferation track in the context of the Global Nuclear Security Summit to be held in Washington on April 12 13, in which President Dmitry Medvedev will take part In the international agenda the emphasis will be laid on reinvigorating the Middle East peace process, on a politico diplomatic settlement to the Iran nuclear problem and on strengthening Russian American cooperation in Afghan stabilization efforts Several other bilateral topics of mutual interest will also, presumably, be touched upon Moscow views the announcement on March 9 by Israel s Interior Ministry of plans to build 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem s Ramat Shlomo neighborhood with great concern We believe that such Israeli actions are unacceptable They run counter to the generally recognized international legal basis for a settlement, and prejudge the outcome of the negotiation process, during which a solution must be found to the final status issues, including Jerusalem We call on the Israeli authorities to refrain from such negative unilateral steps This is particularly important at such a sensitive moment, when the international community has intensified efforts to bring a lasting and just peace to the Middle East, and the parties the Palestinians and Israelis after a long hiatus show a desire to resume talks, albeit still indirect The nascent opportunity to advance towards settlement cannot be allowed to fail The text is available on the Russian MFA website information tape The tenth round of Russian US negotiations to craft a new full blown agreement on further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms opened in Geneva on March 9 Overall, we believe the negotiations have reached the final stage most of the text of the document has been agreed During the round that has begun, the delegations continue working intensively on finalizing all provisions of the draft new SOA treaty so as to submit it for signing by the Russian and US Presidents A thorough legal and linguistic collation of the text is being conducted in parallel The mindset on both sides is to ensure the possibility of signing a new treaty in the nearest future On March 2, the UN General Assembly adopted, by consensus, a resolution on âCooperation between the United Nations and the Collective Security Treaty Organization â The adoption of the resolution lays the legal foundation to further strengthen practical engagement between the UN and the CSTO, which has held observer status at the UN General Assembly since 2004 We are convinced that expanding cooperation by the UN and other bodies of its system with the Collective Security Treaty Organization on a regular and orderly basis will help implement the goals and objectives of the world community in its quest for effective solutions to international problems in the domain of security and counteraction against new challenges and threats, enhance the potential of both organizations, particularly in the field of peace keeping, and promote global and regional peace and stability Before the briefing I was asked the following question How can the Foreign Ministry comment on the statement of Angela Merkel that the proposal of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for a new European security architecture should be considered in the trilateral France Germany Russia format? I will answer We note the important contribution of our French and German partners to the discussion of the problems of the formation of a new European security architecture We believe it is important to employ all multilateral dialogue formats available in our space Optimally, the Treaty should be negotiated at an independent venue with the participation of states and international organizations (EU, NATO, OSCE, CSTO, CIS) which are also actors of international relations We advocate further advancing discussions on the specific content of the Draft European Security Treaty in all relevant multilateral venues like Russia EU dialogue on a common security space, the Russia NATO Council and the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation We are looking forward to substantive discussion on the Treaty also in other forums, both bilateral and trilateral The initiative of Angela Merkel is fully in keeping with this logic, and Russia is ready to discuss European architecture questions with the participation of our French and German partners A parliamentary general election was held in Iraq on March 7 Its results will be announced in the coming days The election reportedly took place in difficult conditions Before and on Election Day, terrorist acts, including bombings and mortar attacks in Baghdad and other cities, killed dozens of people and injured more than a hundred others But in general, as prevalently acknowledged, the election may be declared valid This is confirmed by the conclusions of international representatives, including the Russian observers stationed in the Kurdish Autonomous Region, and the Russian embassy staff in Baghdad, involved in monitoring the voting in the capital Moscow welcomes the successful holding of the elections to the Iraqi parliament, in which for the first time since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the representatives of all political forces and ethno confessional communities in the country took part This gives an opportunity to continue the real inclusive political process so necessary for achieving national reconciliation in Iraq, strengthening its independence and realizing by the Iraqis their right to dispose of their own destiny and natural resources That is the line Moscow has consistently pursued We express the hope that the formation of a new cabinet and organs of government without delay will help to speed efforts to improve the economic and social conditions of life for the Iraqis, to strengthen Baghdad s relations with its neighbors and to facilitate the enhancement of its role in regional and international affairs At French President Nicolas Sarkozy s initiative, Paris hosted the International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy on March 8 9, attended by top nuclear officials from 60 countries Director General of the Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation Sergey Kiriyenko represented the Russian Federation The discussions have shown the growing interest of many states to develop national nuclear energy and to ensure their access to the world market for nuclear energy services In his speech, Sergey Kiriyenko focused participants attention on the advanced experience and capabilities of Russia in the international nuclear market, including the construction of nuclear power plants on a turnkey basis, readiness to apply flexible financing schemes, fuel supply for the entire period of the operation of nuclear power plants, and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing services He especially highlighted Russia's initiatives to establish the International Uranium Enrichment Center in Angarsk and to set up a guaranteed IAEA supervised reserve of low enriched uranium at this Center Kiriyenko stressed that these initiatives were aimed at realizing states lawful right of access to peaceful nuclear technologies on condition that they comply with their nonproliferation obligations We received a request from RIA Novosti to comment on the current level of the negotiation process on Nagorno Karabakh conflict settlement What steps are the mediators now undertaking to assist the parties in the rapprochement of their positions around the unagreed points of the Madrid Document? We regard progress in the negotiations as normal There is a discussion underway on the working proposals of the mediators, the Co Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, regarding the basic principles of Nagorno Karabakh settlement, which were handed to the parties about two months ago and have received the appellation of the âRenewed Madrid Document â Now the mediators are studying the parties reaction to these proposals Last week they met with Azerbaijan s Foreign Minister, and next week will meet with the Foreign Minister of Armenia, who was in Moscow the other day and discussed the Nagorno Karabakh issue with Sergey Lavrov As far as I know, the same problem is to be considered in these days also during the visit to France by President of the Republic of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan As a result of all these meetings, discussions and negotiations, the Co Chairs of the Minsk Group plan to visit Armenia, Nagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan in late March early April to try to bring the parties positions closer together around the unagreed basic principles for conflict settlement The 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), the main UN rights body, began work in Geneva on March 1 The agenda of the session will be rich and varied A high level segment is over, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights presented her annual report During the session, the following thematic debates are planned: â¢ Impact of the global financial and economic crisis on human rights â¢ Structure and role of national mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities â¢ Sexual violence against children The session will consider a wide spectrum of other priority issues regarding the promotion and protection of human rights in the coming weeks: observance of human rights in the fight against terrorism, enforced or involuntary disappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, human rights defenders, religious freedom, the right to housing and the right to food Interactive dialogues with HRC special rapporteurs and independent experts will traditionally be held on these themes The results of the work of the HRC mechanisms the Advisory Committee, the Forum on Minority Issues, and the Social Forum will be discussed The Russian Federation, as a member of the Council, is making every effort to ensure that human rights become a real factor in bringing different states and groups closer together and in building a climate of trust and mutual respect in international relations In this regard, we have consistently opposed the use of human rights as an instrument of pressure on individual countries, politicization and the application of âdouble standardsâ in the human rights sphere Of course, this does not exclude a principled discussion about shortcomings in individual countries We know that there are questions regarding Russia too We will be ready to answer them And we also have questions about discrimination against Russian language education and the Russian language in individual countries and about counteracting xenophobia The Russian Federation has consistently and actively promoted respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all people without distinction as to race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion and language The introduction of discriminatory restrictions on rights on these grounds is unacceptable: phenomena like Nazism, segregation and apartheid are still fresh in our memory This is especially true today, as we prepare to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the historic victory over fascism At the current session of the Council, Russia is initiating its traditional draft resolution condemning one of the most odious forms of discrimination and human rights violations the arbitrary deprivation of citizenship We hope that, as before, our initiative will receive broad support We have received questions regarding the investigation of a number of HRC special procedures on secret prisons This theme has also found reflection in the Russian and foreign media In this regard, I can say the following A number of special procedures (the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; special rapporteur on torture; the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances) have conducted a joint study on the existing world practice regarding the secret detention of persons in the context of combating terrorism At a February 18 organizational meeting in preparation for the 13th HRC session, the representatives of a number of countries, including Russia, declared that there were procedural irregularities in the preparation of the document In particular, this concerned the working rules of the Council and the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures The special rapporteurs are not âfree artistsâ"" who create by obeying only their own inspiration Their activities are directed by the UN intergovernmental human rights bodies in the form of the HRC and the General Assembly Third Committee to be precise, which commission the special rapporteurs to prepare specific reports and studies for submission to the Council and/or the General Assembly In other words, the âfreedom of actionâ of those experts is rather limited In addition, the investigation did not include information and opinions received by the authors from states, which, of course, would have made the report more objective and balanced Concerning the report of the UN Secretary General s Special Representative on the Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, Walter Kalin, at the 13th UN Human Rights Council session following his visit to South Ossetia On March 8, in Geneva, during the 13th session of UN Human Rights Council (HRC), Walter Kalin, the special representative of the UN Secretary General on the Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, presented a report on the outcome of his visit to South Ossetia in November 2009 We find the report s one sidedness deplorable The author proved unable to avoid a politically charged approach, betraying incomprehension of the new geopolitical realities in the region We would like to emphasize that the trip of Kalin occurred precisely because the South Ossetian authorities themselves had invited him to visit the country and provided the special representative with all the necessary information in the hope that the UN expert, following his promises, would carefully study the facts and draw objective conclusions about the situation in the region Unfortunately, this did not happen Thus, the report of Mr Kalin has no mention of the suffering endured by the Ossetian people He is also silent on the causes of the forced displacements of Ossetians in August 2008, which, as already acknowledged by all, were the aggressive actions of the Saakashvili regime Nothing is said of the shelling of civilian targets by Georgian troops in South Ossetia, including kindergartens, schools and hospitals There is no mention of the documented facts of the shootings by Georgian troops of civilians, deliberate destruction and desecration of monuments of Ossetian culture and places of burial Finally, the document contains not a single word about the tens of thousands of men and women, old people and children of Ossetian nationality driven by Georgians from their native places in the early 90s Also not true is the assertion of Mr Kalin about certain restrictions on humanitarian access to South Ossetia Practice shows that for those entities that actually want to help that country, access is open to the republic Unfortunately, the delegation of South Ossetia was unable to participate in an interactive dialogue with Walter Kalin as the âcountry concernedâ to express its opinion about the âvalueâ of the report Russia considers it important to respect the right of all displaced persons to voluntary return in safety and dignity to their places of permanent residence Here we fully concur with Kalin In line with international practice of implementation of return programs, the key elements of this process are normalizing the situation, creating conditions and providing explicit guarantees of non resumption of hostilities As we have repeatedly said, this calls for concluding an agreement on the non use of force between South Ossetia and Georgia, which, however, keeps avoiding the issue in every way I have been asked how the Foreign Ministry can comment on the recent contacts of Russian officials with representatives of the Georgian opposition in light of a possible improvement of bilateral relations In this regard, I will note that the line on destroying the traditional good neighborliness with Russia that the Saakashvili regime is pursuing with maniacal persistence has become a source of increasing worry for sensible politicians in Georgia who really care about the welfare of their people We are ready to have a dialogue with them and all who are aware that this line is perilous for the long term national interests of Georgia Today they include such opposition figures as ex Premier Zurab Nogaideli and former Georgian Parliamentary Speaker Nino Burjanadze At the same time, we do not intend to interfere in the internal affairs of Georgia A way out of the impasse into which the current regime has led the country is to be found by Georgian society itself and by the responsible and sane part of its political class We have noted the information about the plans for the creation by the United States at the request of the Government of Kyrgyzstan, of an antiterrorism training center in the south of the republic The development of Kyrgyz American cooperation in the realm of security is, of course, a sovereign matter of both parties At the same time we believe that the multifaceted, time proven cooperation in counter terrorism between Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic, our ally and strategic partner, will continue to grow both on a bilateral basis and within the CSTO and the SCO for reliable stability and security in Central Asia, as well as help build the counter terrorism capacity of Kyrgyzstan I was asked to comment on the recent developments in Nigeria, where the ethnic clashes resulted in considerable loss of life According to information from Nigeria, massive religious ethnic violence again occurred on the environs of Jos, capital of the country s North central Plateau state, on the night of March 6 7, killing several hundred civilians, including women and children According to a report from the Embassy of Russia in Nigeria, there are no Russian citizens among the victims there The sectarian bloodbath in friendly Nigeria evokes profound concern and regret in Moscow We hope that the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will be able to bring the situation under control and stop the violence, prevent further loss of life and take all necessary measures for a quick return to stability I have been asked about the current domestic political situation in Pakistan in connection with the terrorist attack in Lahore The attack in Lahore on March 8, killing 14 people, was another in a series of bloody terrorist attacks that have swept the country since October last year The Pakistani Taliban, acting violently and delivering blows to civilian targets among others, are attempting to force the government to stop its large scale counter terrorist operation in the tribal zone, involving a group of armed forces and special units numbering more than 125,000 men Overall, despite some successes in suppressing the Taliban with force, the situation remains difficult in the country and will require additional efforts on the part of the Pakistani authorities to stabilize the situation On March 1 4, the second round of Russia US consultations on the export of poultry from the United States and the requirements of Russian legislation banning the use of chlorine containing solutions in its treatment took place at Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow The US delegation was headed by Under Secretary of Agriculture Jim Miller and Assistant Trade Representative Jim Murphy Chief Sanitary Inspector Gennady Onishchenko conducted the talks from the Russian side The participants discussed technical aspects of the organization of meat processing plants in the US and the use of various disinfectants not containing active chlorine, along with a draft document aimed at resolving the question of US RT News App Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization âTV Novostiâ, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies

"28 Jan, 2010",Afghanistan summit: nations discuss countryâs future,"More than 70 international delegates and organizations met in London to discuss plans to strengthen the Afghan government and replace foreign troops with local forces The day long conference was co hosted by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Afghan President Hamid Karzai and UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen also attended the talks A key issue discussed was the plan to reintegrate Taliban fighters into civilian life in return for abandoning militancy Effective governance, corruption and national security were also on the agenda An agreement prescribing the terms under which the power of decision making will be passed to the Afghan authorities has already been signed by Afghanistan and the other conference participants Karzai envisions Afghanistan s government taking control of security in all 34 provinces by 2015, but said he expects foreign troops to stay in his country for up to a decade As Hamid Karzai called for support from neighboring Pakistan and oil rich Saudi Arabia, the international community has promised to increase financial support to Afghanistan by 50% as well as provide humanitarian assistance and help restore the country s infrastructure Political analyst Mikhail Troitsky believes the international community should continue financing Karzai s regime Karzai is the best of the available options at the moment Plus, it is not his fault that a large chunk of international aid to Afghanistan lines the pockets of the Taliban, but rather it is due to the perennial state of affairs in Afghanistan, Troitsky says Former Afghan presidential candidate and opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah puts the Afghan government in the spotlight Unless [Karzai] accepts the realities of Afghanistan and finds a way to unite the people, Afghanistan s problems will continue, he says What we need now is a political and civilian surge to match the military surge We have to put alongside security and stability, transferring responsibility overtime from the international community to the Afghan army and police,  Ivan Lewis, UK Minister for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs told RT   Alongside that, we have got to ensure that the government is more effective, that it is serious about stamping out corruption, so it can regain the trust of the Afghan people  Meanwhile, Sabah Al Mukhtar, President of the Arab Lawyers Association, denies the effectiveness of the planned strategy He says Afghans who oppose US involvement in Afghanistan and see their country as being hijacked  by foreign forces will not accept the proposed terms Listening to what has been said so far, it does not look like there is any seriousness in dealing with the issue Because they are still talking about corruption and what have you, as if these are the causes of the problem in Afghanistan, as if it is not the occupation,  Al Mukhtar said Barak Hoffman from the Center for Democracy and Civil Society says the decisions taken in London fail to present a consistent approach towards Afghanistan It s not entirely clear what the policy is at this point It seems to be changing day by day What the Afghan government wants seems to be negotiated with the Taliban For years it had been part of our policy that we had to destroy the Taliban or at least weaken them in extent that the Afghan government could control them And listening to what happened in London is that now we are going to negotiate with the Taliban Is that because we have realized that there is no threat anymore? They are surely not weaker   in fact they are stronger   but it doesn t seem to be embedded in a more comprehensive strategy, as it seems to be shifting day by day as we saw in the London conference, he said Following the talks, Ban Ki moon said that, despite the agreements made, there are no easy solutions for Afghanistan s recovery and peace remains a long way off US Blogger Gregg Carlstrom says it s part of a reconciliation plan that is going to fail as long as the Taliban feels it has the upper hand in Afghanistan The problem with this specific plan we are trying to implement it right now is that the Taliban is not going to stop fighting unless it feels like it s losing If it feels like it s winning on the battlefield, it has no incentive to lay down its arms, Carlstrom told RT And right now, NATO casualties are up pretty substantially from where they were a year ago  Read also:Afghan women: We cannot step on the streets for fear of acid attacks  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti , 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/afghanistan-conference-london-troops/
"13 Oct, 2009",ROAR: âClinton not shining as bright as Obamaâ,"It is expected that the US Secretary of State will propose new ideas for the further resetting of Russian US relations Hillary Clinton is visiting Moscow to hold talks with the Russian leadership on nuclear arms, missile defense, Iran and human rights It is not easy for Clinton to represent the US president, believes Aleksey Malashenko from the Carnegie Moscow Center Barack Obama is enthusiastic about changing the world, he wrote in Kommersant daily Clinton is absolutely different from Obama because she is by origin from the Soviet American epoch, Malashenko said However, Clinton understands post Soviet politicians well and may deal with them openly enough, the analyst added She may be closer psychologically to [Prime Minister] Vladimir Putin and [Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov than to her immediate chief whose competitor she was at the election, Malashenko went on to say The talks between Clinton and the Russian leadership will show to what extent Obama s populism is in harmony with pragmatism and conservatism of Washington s veterans, he said Argumenty i Facty weekly, in turn, asks if Clinton is trying to achieve the same influence in the US as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice did It was not difficult to shine against the background of George Bush, but Obama s star, crowned by the Nobel Committee, is so bright now that all successes in foreign policy are attributed to him, not to the Secretary of State, the weekly said The visit to Moscow is the first serious test for Clinton and her chance to confirm by real actions her ambitions, the paper said But with all their smiles, Clinton and her spouse Bill have not had special sympathies to Russia, the weekly added In this regard, Barack Obama seems the more perspective partner in talks, more so because he easily finds an understanding with Dmitry Medvedev, Argumenty i Facty said Russian diplomacy is likely to address Obama after finding Hillary s incompliance, the paper added Maksim Minaev, analyst at the Center for Political Conjuncture, called Clinton s visit a tactical move in the development of the process of resetting relations between Russia and US The issues that Clinton will discuss in Moscow have already been raised in the dialogue between the two countries leaders in July during Obama s visit, he added Now, the Secretary of State and her department do not play a strategic role in determining Washington s policies toward Russia, the analyst stressed This role belongs to the White House s staff and National Security council, he added However, many Russian observers really expect Clinton to make breakthroughs in Moscow One of the main issues that are being discussed is a new document that should replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 1) Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has expressed hope that the new treaty will be developed by December, when the old one expires Also, on the eve of the secretary s visit, Russian US consultations started in Moscow on a range of issues, including missile defense The talks should confirm that resetting relations started by the presidents of the two countries is continuing successfully, Kommersant daily said The US administration floated new ideas during these discussions, the paper said, calling them the results of recent talks between Russian and US presidents in New York American experts showed concrete details of the approach of Barack Obama s administration to missile defense, the paper said Clinton is also expected to propose to Russia the building of a joint missile defense system Kommersant quoted Michael McFaul, the US president s Special Assistant for National Security and Russian and Eurasian affairs, as saying that the main result of meetings between the Russian and US presidents was that the missile defense system should be created together with Russia  Citing the US president s assistant, the paper also wrote that Washington was not going to include Ukraine in its plans on the new missile defense system Vedomosti daily wrote that Russia s priority at the talks was the preparation of the new treaty on strategic arms reduction In July, the presidents of Russia and the US agreed to limit the number of warheads in the range of 500 1100, the paper said Moscow is insisting on the lower level, and Washington the higher, the paper added During Clinton s visit the two sides may come to an agreement about a compromise variant, the paper said, adding that analysts assume that the level will be limited to 800 warheads  At the same time, observers say that Moscow will continue to link the talks on strategic arms reduction to US plans on missile defense Vedomosti quoted an anonymous source in the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying that offensive arms and missile defense are the two sides of one medal  For the US the main topic of the talks in Moscow will be Iran, Vedomosti said Clinton s task is to enlist Russia s support in the issue of sanctions against Iran in case the negotiations on Tehran s nuclear program are not successful, the paper said Clinton is also scheduled to meet with Russian students and representatives of civil society and to visit the city of Kazan The US Secretary of State will also discuss in Moscow the work of the bilateral presidential commission This work is not very active on topics that are not of paramount importance, Pavel Zolotarev, deputy director of the USA and Canada Institute noted One should understand that there is no basis for a many sided development of Russian US relations, even economic ties are weak, Zolotarev told Gazeta ru website One of the key groups of the commission is one on the development of civil society This issue was also discussed during the talks that started on the eve of Clinton s visit to Russia Washington is likely to stop criticizing Russia s sovereign democracy,  Kommersant said To confirm this, the paper quoted McFaul as saying that the reset of relations includes the problems of human rights Mr MacFaul made it clear that the US no longer intends to teach Russia about democracy, provoking Moscow s irritation, and instead wants to concentrate on practical work with non governmental organizations, the paper said This actually means abandoning the policies of previous US administrations that always publicly criticized the situation with human rights in Russia, the paper said However, Clinton will meet with representatives of civil society and human rights activists Some observers think that the US is ready to support the Russian leadership to gain geopolitical concessions, first of all in the Iran issue In any event, the only important disagreement between Moscow and Washington is Georgia s boundaries after the 2008 war over South Ossetia, Kommersant wrote According to the paper, McFaul said that the US would not emphasize this problem It is difficult to solve it in the near future, and Washington does not want to generate tension when the Russian US relations are improving, the paper said Sergey Borisov, RT RT News App ©
