probably haven t heard of Aleksey Pushkov He s an influential academic, politician, and media personality who once ran the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Duma (the lower house of the parliament) and is widely considered to be close to the Kremlin In the early hours of Monday morning, as the extent of Vladimir Putin s latest presidential victory became clear, he took to Twitter to make a very important point: western demonization of Putin inspires the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this ù Influential Russian politician & commentator Alexei Pushkov says western demonization of Putin causes the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this https:// tdotco /IPgDfW8Zsb Pushkov is correct Because Putin s latest landslide was partially made in the West To understand why, we need to rewind the clock to 2011 Back then, on the surface at least, Russia was doing well economically The ruble was trading around 30 to the US dollar and the price of oil was high While the country s reliance on the latter resource was always a poor long term strategy, it provided easy money And this meant Russians could afford to travel to places, and buy imported products, which Soviet citizens could only have dreamed of, two decades earlier Despite this, a considerable amount of people weren t happy And when the sitting president, Dmitry Medvedev, announced in September that he was stepping aside to support Putin s (who was serving as prime minister) return to the Kremlin, anger grew in some sections of society, especially the pro business and liberal factions You see, for them, Medvedev represented the promise of liberalization and westernization, and the return of Putin was seen as a step backwards towards nationalism, conservatism, and even authoritarianism In December, the Duma election took place, with United Russia, the party associated with Putin and Medvedev, failing to win a majority of the vote Some alleged the contest had been falsified and the party s real share was even smaller READ MORE:America s elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world As a result, protests kicked off, largely centered in Moscow But there were also demonstrations in many provincial cities, including Khabarovsk, more than 8,000km from Moscow, where I resided at the time At this moment, one thing was very clear: many Russians sought a new sense of identity, and the various post Soviet factions were heading for a showdown One which took place over the following months In December, the Western media had decided to christen the unrest as the Snow Revolution , amemewhich conjured memories of similar events in Ukraine and Georgia, labelled Orange and Rose respectively And this was a serious error because Russians weren t looking for the overthrow of their state And, at least in the heartland, many feared a return to the anarchy of the 1990s Thus, while certain capital city circles sizzled with talk of revolution, where I was living, people seemed horrified by the very idea This is the rich Moscow elite marching, these guys have nothing in common with me, ù was a typical statement While others seemed to think the protestors were ungrateful, because, after all, their very prosperity was mostly down to Putin, who had inherited a basket case economy in 2000 and greatly improved living standards Nevertheless, things became very tense for a while, with no less a figure than Mikhail Gorbachev publiclycallingfor Putin to resign † Of course, Putin didn t heed Gorby s call Instead, he continued his presidential campaign and in March 2012, won handsomely, with a score of 63% nationally, but only 46% in Moscow Now, this is where I need to explain something: the 2011/12 protests were, more or less, a big smoke ù phenomenon And it explains † why Western media correspondents, who are all based in Moscow and have little understanding of the rest of Russia, beyond itsoccasionalnovelty value, made their readers and viewers believe something substantial was stirring when the reality was less dramatic Because, in a place like Khabarovsk, the movement gained no traction beyond a bit of muttering in cafes and between close family and friends Putin realized this and learned a lesson In his first two terms, he d probably spent too much time worrying about the Moscow elite From now on, he was going to focus on his base, the ordinary folk who keep Russia working And little did he know at the time, but the West was about to lend a helping hand The KremlinbelievedHillary Clinton had interfered in Russia s 2011/12 unrest, but her influence was limited, even if Putin s team regarded it as a betrayal However, America s behavior in Ukraine in 2013/14 was another matter entirely This was the US openly intervening in street protests in Russia s neighbor and Clinton s former assistant secretary of state,Victoria Nuland, was leading the charge eventually even going so far aschoosinga new government in the aftermath For Russians, it was incredible Ukraine, home to entire regions where ethnic Russians constitute a significant majority, was, as they saw it, being destabilized in a Western backed coup Something which meant that Crimea, part of Russia for hundreds of years until Nikita Khrushchev signed it away in the 1950s, could have feasibly wound up housing NATO bases Thus, when Putin decided to reabsorb the peninsula in the spring of 2014, his popularity ratings reached unprecedented levels Because Russians believed the West had betrayed them And, since then, the EU and the US have played into his hands Russians are fully aware of Western scaremongering about their country and the demonization of their president They see it on news sites, across social media, and on TV And the ones who can t understand English can even read Russian translations of the Western press on a dedicated website, Inosmi (which, incidentally, is state funded) Furthermore, in addition to the constant barrage of media delirium, the NATO countries sanctions policy has created a besieged fortress mentality in Russia Indeed, Andrey Kondrashov, Putin s campaign spokesman, summed this up on Sunday night Turnout is higher than we expected, by about 8 10 percent, for which we must say thanks to Great Britain, ù hesaidwith tongue surely in cheek, referring to the fallout from a spy poisoning drama in the UK We were pressured exactly at the moment when we needed to mobilize [voters] Whenever Russia is accused of something indiscriminately and without any evidence, the Russian people unite around the center of power And the center of power is certainly Putin today ù In 2012, Putin was under pressure in Moscow, but this weekend he secured over 70% of the vote in thecapital And in St Petersburg, where he managed 58% six years ago, he can now boast a 75% score And it has happened at a time when Russians have endured a deep recession, with falling real wages, during a painful, but necessary, economic restructuring after the previous resource driven model exhausted itself Today, even liberal, educated, and cosmopolitan dwellers of the two big cities generally support the status of Crimea and now resent the West for its anti Russia hysteria Whereas in 2011 12, many saw the US as a country to aspire to, now they are disappointed with Washington and believe the US to be fundamentally opposed to respecting any of Russia s vital interests READ MORE:Putin s landslide victory to attract

"29 Dec, 2017",2017 could have been year Russia and US made up. Now they stand on brink of new Cold War,"On this day 12 months ago, Moscow held off from retaliating to Barack Obama s diplomatic parting shot, in hope of a new start Instead, 2017 has been the worst year of US Russia relations since the fall of the Berlin Wall Three weeks before leaving the Oval Office, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Moscow owned properties in the US over claims of election meddling Counter measures were expected I invite all children of US diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas children s parties in the Kremlin, ùRussian President Vladimir Putinannouncedinstead, capitalizing on the moment to show unexpected festive magnanimity Yet by that point Russia s bogeyman role as the explanation of the Democrats loss in the 2016 election, and the weapon with which to delegitimize the incoming President Donald Trump, was set Shattered , the sympathetic chronicle of Hillary Clinton s doomed presidential run,detailshow less than 24 hours after the concession speech ùher campaign manager John Podesta and his team gathered at their emptying headquarters to forge the narrative for the coming months in which Russian hacking was the centerpiece ù On January 10, 2017 BuzzFeedpublishedtheDNC fundedChristopher Steeledossier a historic document not for the revelations contained therein, but as a marker for the strength of sentiments against Donald Trump, and a watershed for the deliberate dropping of US journalistic standards for a political cause An alliance between the bitter Republican establishment and vengeful Democrats has since formed in Congress, driving the anti Russian agenda throughout the year The sanctions bill overwhelmingly passed in July designated Russia alongside Iran and North Korea as America s official adversaries ùIt also charged Moscow with such a wide ranging list offenses encompassing Ukraine, Syria, hacking, energy security threats and a similarly lengthy list of targets from politicians, to oligarchs, to companies, to banks that even with the best will in the world, it is not clear that the Kremlin could fulfil any specific criteria to have them removed Congress also did not pass up the opportunity to humiliate its president like an untrustworthy child, by placing severe restrictions on Trump s ability to loosen any of the measures regardless of international dynamics, thus rendering all future diplomatic efforts likely futile Hence the pitiful sight of Trumpsigningthe bill into action even as he denigrated it as deeply flawed ù Unsurprisingly, Moscow said that the measures would result in an out and out trade war ùwhile Putin called them illegal ùand bemoaned that US Russian relations are being sacrificed to resolve internal policy issues ù The act gave the start to the most unedifying tit for tat saga of the year, in which both sides tasked themselves with calculating exactly how many consular staff they needed to expel to reach parity ùin the stand off, and arguing over whether each step was an escalation or merely the just response in the dispute In response to Congress and those initially unanswered expulsions, PutinorderedUS missions to reduce their payroll by 755 employees One month later, in late August, the White House gave Moscow 72 hoursto shutterthree of its diplomatic buildings, including its oldest consulate in San Francisco, which in turn led to threats oflawsuitsfrom the Russian side, unhappy about being forced out of properties it owns The drip drip of hostilities has carried on through the past three months, with many of the announcements centered on international media Following the US order to single out RT America as a foreign agent ù a designation originally created to root out Nazi propagandists before World War II Washington and Moscow have engaged in one upmanship, with the Russian Duma passing a mirror bill, which reduced what was already a nebulous term into a playground insult In an example of the pettiness and the low stakes, RT has been stripped of its congressional credentials and US reporters can no longer visit the Duma None of the above measures will pave the way for a d√©tente, but what if this is not the American aim? After all, the White House national security strategy published earlier this month talks of preserving peace through strength, and advancing American influence in the world ùall while promoting our way of life ùIn turn, Russia is described as challenging American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity ù If the US yardstick of success is not peace but domination, then punishing the Kremlin is a success, and the question becomes, is the US treatment of Russia effective in asserting its superiority and changing Moscow s behavior? ù But on this score 2017 has also been a failure for the US, due to a lack of a coherent approach, as even John McCain would admit Trump has spoken of healing ùrelations with Moscow that talk has been echoed by his lieutenants and does not come across as an obvious figurehead in a new Cold War However, he hasn t been so much as able to exchange several words with Putin at an official dinner without being brandeda traitorby large swathes of the establishment On the other hand, no one appears to have been pushing Trump to order the consulate closures, which aggravated the Kremlin more than the more substantial but less arbitrary moves And yet when Trump made the decision, was he really motivated by a desire to achieve geopolitical results, or as a means of deflecting accusations about being friendly to Russia? Or did he do it at the behest of security and military officials the same ones whose hand can be seen inthe latest doctrine? This is chaos From the angle of effectiveness, if anyone has gained from the erratic US policy making it is Putin, who looks measured, consistent and statesmanlike in his pronouncements, while his officials speak with one voice, as Russia has clearly pursued a number of international policies over a period of several years While Putin can take solace from his increasingly prominent portrait as an international diplomatic mastermind outwitting the hapless Trump, it is obvious that the last 12 months have been a lose lose proposition for both Washington and Moscow The simmering morass leaves Russia cut off from the West, in a situation where international sanctions become the new normal Meanwhile, the White House misses out on a potential economic and diplomatic partner on issues from the Middle East to North Korea to the Arctic, and retains a regional rival forever capable of throwing around its international weight or scuttling a UN Security Council resolution Ironically, 2017 was geopolitically an opportune year for the two countries to mend relations Both countries can take credit fordefeating ISIS and not catching each other in the crossfire The Syrian conflict has swung decisively to President Bashar Assad s government, with the White House fully aware that from now on deal making could bring greater dividends than pouring more money and goodwill in the black hole of supporting the opposition The Ukrainian conflict remains intractable, but has receded in diplomatic importance, while accepting Crimean secession as a fait accompli has become plausible enough if the issue is not to poison Moscow Washington relations for decades to come Even if circumstances continue to be favorable in 2018, prospects for a thaw remain thin The Democrats will not let go of the Russia Trump story even if the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller yieldsno smoking gun, while specific sanctions against Russia as a result of July s law will likely power a new spiral of strife Putin is the overwhelming favorite for re election, while Trump s political ratings don t give him much leeway Nor is his policy making growing more structured Over the next 12 months, in the face of inexorable inertia pulling apart Russia and the United States, a stagnant lull would likely count as progress Igor Ogorodnev for RT   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/414552-russia-us-diplomatic-crisis/
"13 Dec, 2017",US State Dept offers smug gestures but no answers on stripping of RT credentials,"State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert has brushed off a question from RT about the withdrawal of its Congress credentials, and whether this contradicts her past vow that registration as a foreign agent would not impede the broadcaster s ability to report Nauert fell short of providing a clear answer to RT s Sameera Khan on whether the State Department still stands by its word that forcing RT America to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was a formality that would not create hurdles for RT s work in the US I think that press credentials might have been revoked by Congress, and not necessarily the members of Congress but rather the Association of Reporters that handles who gets to come and cover Congress, ùNauert said, deflecting the question Instead, she played the Russia card , dubbing the RT correspondent a representative of the Russian government ùwhose mere presence at the briefing should serve as sufficient proof of Washington s utmost respect for the freedom of press They can get Russian news, if you will, ùshe generously conceded complete with air quotes via GIPHY Twitchy quote fingers aren t a new thing for Nauert she used the same snide gesture back in October, when assuring RT that registering under FARA wouldn t impact or affect the ability of them to report news and information ù Again, the air quotes via GIPHY The following month, RT America s foreign agent status was cited by the US congressional press office as it stripped RT of its Capitol Hill accreditation In a letter, the Executive Committee of the Congress Radio & Television Correspondents Galleries explicitly says that it is prohibited from issuing credentials to any applicant employed by any foreign government or representative thereof ù The State Department spokesperson is not the first US official to (pretend) not to see a connection between the two events Last week, US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman told Kommersant FM radio that he didn t believe that the stripping of credentials is a consequence of FARA, but rather a result of the vote on the sanctions against Russia that left a deep imprint on Congress In response to the crackdown on the Russian media in the US, several US media outlets, including Voice of America and Radio Liberty, have been registered as foreign agents in Russia under a reciprocal law proposed and adopted by the State Duma, Russia s lower house of parliament Dave Lindorff, investigative journalist and founder of the news website This Can t Be Happening, believes that evicting RT from the US Congress serves only to further demonize Russia, and that Russia will likely remain the only victim I think this is all focused on demonizing Russia and it has to do with the military industrial complex wanting to have an enemy and people getting tired of the war on terror, so why not to have the revival of a sort of Cold War That s a great way to get money for weapons systems, like, really expensive ones, ùLindorff said Since Russia is such a convenient scapegoat, Lindorff suggested that pushing the anti Russian narrative may come in handy for US Congress members from both sides of the aisle, as it allows a congressperson without having really to do anything to go back to their voters and say: Oh, I m taking a tough stand against this Russian interference in our democratic system ù The continuing anti Russian hysteria has also been fueled by the Democratic leadership, which is still trying steer people away from the idea that they blew away the election by pushing the nomination of Hillary Clinton who then blew the elections, ùLindorff argued   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/412926-nauert-responds-rt-question-credentials/

Especially when it warns that a nuclear armed military superpower is interfering in the American democratic process, but then offers not a smidgen of proof for its assertions Not to mention how it appears to have been put together by a group of people with barely a clue about Russia For instance, RT programs such as Breaking The Set ùand The Truthseeker ùare mentioned in a submission supposed to be about how RT seemingly cost Hillary Clinton the US Presidential Election But both of these programmes went off air around two years ago And, back then, Clinton wasn t even the Democratic Party candidate for the 2016 contest Furthermore, it s deeply odd how this seems to be part of a super old report, with just a tiny disclaimer in that regard Official DNI report on Russia says my show Breaking the Set, that ended 2 yrs ago, helped cost Hillary the electionhttps:// tdotco /LyNZIaDxQmpic twitter com/Ha0rWNlSwV The stream of obsolete information continues Readers could be led to believe that the head of RT s Arabic Service is Aydar Aganin and the London bureau is headed by Darya Pushkova The problem is neither of these individuals currently work at RT, nor have done for a long time And the focus on the latter is presumably because she s defined as the daughter of Aleksey Pushkov, the current chair of the Duma Russian Foreign Affairs Committee But even if she were employed at RT, what would be unusual about it anyway? After all, many journalists have family members who ve been involved in politics at one time or another For instance, CNN host Christiane Amanpour s husband James Rubin was an advisor to Hillary Clinton, and served as a US Assistant Secretary of State under her husband, Bill So how bad is this report? You d have to say on a scale of 1 10, it d be eleven The core message appears to be that having a point of view which is out of sync with the liberal popular media is considered a hostile act by US spooks And it s specifically the liberal press worldview they are defending here Now, it s up to you to judge whether this support, from state actors, is justified or not The DNI s submission is ostensibly the work of highly qualified intelligence experts, but everything you learn about RT comes from publicly available interviews and Tweets posted by this channel s own people Yet, we are supposed to believe how the best Russia brains of three agencies the CIA, FBI and NSA laboured to produce this stuff? That said, the latter doesn t appear to be fully on board, offering moderate ùconfidence, in contrast to the other s high confidence ù Approximately a third of the document centers on RT And it appears that we should swallow how RT succeeded where the combined might of CNN, NBC, CBS, The Washington Post and the New York Times and others failed in influencing the US election Not to mention the reality where 500 US media outlets endorsed Clinton and only 25 President elect Donald Trump It s time to scream: stop the lights! ù Meanwhile, the background info ùon RT offered here appears to have been compiled on the basis of poorly translated decade old articles and long obsolete stats As a result, the only current stuff, actually relevant to the 2016 election, comes down to Russia hacked US election because RT criticized Clinton ùThe absurdity of the claim is evidently lost on the authors The mistakes are myriad Audience figures are out of date And the general feel is of some kind of amateurish compilation from a think tank In fact, you could argue that many lobby firms anti Russia reports have been more polished than this offering But they are chancers, with faux academic sounding titles, and the DNI is supposed to boast the finest minds of US intelligence They re kidding, right? Social media unimpressed by intel report on#Russia #hackinghttps:// tdotco /fGRz6c2qCnpic twitter com/4WbUa10aQE Of course, it could also be argued that it s the inevitable result of how funding for Russian studies was choked in the US after the Soviet collapse And many have argued this point Because it s abundantly clear that all three agencies urgently need to hire better experts for their Russian desks For example, people who ve spent a bit of time in the country and can point to a rudimentary grasp of the language More outdated facts follow When it comes to YouTube views, the report cites a figure of 800 million for RT However, it s five times higher, at four billion, and counting Indeed, the English language channel alone can be proud of over 1 5 billion hits at present The point needs to be laboured because it exposes how shoddy this submission is The compilers plainly couldn t have been bothered to engage an intern to update their figures before publication And it speaks volumes So too when a Kommersant article, dated 07/04/2012 is explained as the fourth of July, as opposed to the seventh of April Because you d imagine Russia focused spies would be able to understand the European dating style, wouldn t you? Then there s how the investigators refer to Dmitry Kiselev and Vladimir Zhironovsky as somehow influential here They allege the former s TV show was biased towards Trump s candidacy But it s a domestic programme, in Russian, aimed at people who live in Russia and can t vote in US elections Likewise, Zhirinovsky s presence is bizarre (he s described as a Kremlin proxy ) because he s an ageing clown And, as it happens, his remark about drinking champagne in the event of a Trump victory is rather mild given his track record We are talking about a man who oncepredictedthat George Bush s soldiers would be torn to pieces ùif they invaded Iraq †So Nostradamus, he ain t And his clout with Putin is probably somewhere between slim and none The DNI s report is beyond bad And it s scary to think how outgoing President Obama has stirred up a nasty diplomatic battle with Russia based on intelligence so devoid of insight and quality There is nothing here which suggests the authors have any special savvy or insight In fact, you could argue how a group of students would ve assembled something of similar substance by simply reading back issues of The New York Times But the biggest takeaway is that it s clear how the calibre of Russia expertise in America is mediocre, if not spookily sparse And while this report might be fodder for amusement, the actual policy implications are nothing short of dangerous",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/372942-rt-us-intelligence-reveal/
"16 Dec, 2016",Russophrenia: Western elites ignore their own citizens‚Äô anger and blame Russia instead,"At the start of 1917, rumours reached London that something was stirring in Petrograd (now St Petersburg) As a result, the concerned Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, urgently dispatched Lord Milner, a diplomat of some repute, to the Russian capital Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv His Lordship visited the Tsar and spoke to ministers and members of the Duma, who informed him that enemies of the state were spreading groundless yarns Sadly, being a creature of his class, Milner believed that only the elites mattered so he neglected to consult any of the general public Thus, cocooned in his bubble, the peer reported to London that there was nothing the government could not handle and no need to expect no major changes However, the same British traveling party also included Lloyd George s private secretary Philip Kerr A little more clued in, Kerr walked the streets and interviewed the plain folk Armed with their predictions, he sent a telegram to Downing Street which asserted that Russia was on the verge of an unstoppable revolution As it happens, the man who stepped out of the comfort zone was right because Nikolai II was shorn of his crown before the British delegation made it home We know this story because many years later the Welsh Wizard, Lloyd George, revealed the details to Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to London And almost a hundred years later, it is a salutary lesson in the dangers of the establishment refusing to acknowledge ordinary people s concerns when evaluating the causes of political upheaval Today, it manifests itself in the electoral earthquakes which have recently shocked America and Britain Not to mention the increasing popularity of alternative movements across Europe and the diminishing support for traditional centrist parties and their candidates This has the perennial powers that be running scared but, almost uniformly, they seem unwilling to address their own failings Instead, they seek bogeymen on which to pin the blame And Russia has found itself in the cross hairs with alarming frequency Indeed, it has reached the stage where many popular media outlets see the Kremlin s hidden hand everywhere To paraphrase Percy Bysshe Shelley, Putin s here, Putin s there, Putin s busy everywhere ù But in reality, he s not Because, even if it had the will, Russia simply does not have the resources and capability to interfere in elections across the western world Sure, Moscow might be able to influence one or two, if it seriously targeted them, but the notion that the Kremlin is playing puppet master in countries as disparate as Bulgaria, Italy, France, Germany and the US is pure hokum Despite this, we have the sad spectacle of some Hillary Clinton supporters trying to explain away her failure in the recent Presidential election on Russian meddling We have seen them blame Moscow for Wikileaks exposure of how her own party rigged its primary to ensure her candidacy Also, the Kremlin is fingered for leaking damaging information on Clinton s use of personal email servers, rather than official channels, when Secretary of State Naturally, the fact that these things actually happened seems to be an aside point Then there was the almost comedic sideshow of recounts in certain states where Hillary lost relatively narrowly to Donald Trump Which is Dylan Thomas stuff, raging against the dying of the light ù There s also a schizophrenia at play here, or Russophrenia ùto use a term I coined some time ago American elites, almost simultaneously, ascribe super powers to Russia and then claim the country is dying Even those from the same party Here s another Democrat, Barack Obama, only two years ago: Russia does not make anything † Immigrants aren t rushing to Moscow in search of opportunity The population is shrinking ù Now, never mind that these statements arefalse;they not only reflect a peculiar type of thinking, but also suggest that the quality of advice US leaders are getting on Russia is extremely poor * Reading the op ed pages of outlets like The Washington Post and the New York Times reveals the same Because in these organs, the most prominent voices on Russia tend to be writers with very little (if any) contemporary practical experience of the country And they are usually blinded by strong ideology, which means they simply cannot countenance Moscow s point of view In parts of Europe, we have a very strange terminology which divides political parties and candidates into pro Russia ùand pro Europe ùcamps And never the twain shall meet This curious branding ignores domestic concerns in various nations and infantilizes debate It has also come to mean that any individual who does not unequivocally admonish Moscow is dubbed a useful idiot ù Thus, Bulgaria s incoming President Rumen Radev †is smeared as pro Russian, ùdespite the fact that he was literally a NATO general until a few months ago This carry on is very dangerous Because it creates a new dividing line on the continent Not a physical one as during the Cold War (although NATO is trying hard in that regard) but an artificial equivalent One where if you oppose US hegemony, hyper liberalism, the expansion of Brussels power across Europe, mass migration and fast tracked globalization, you are doing Moscow s bidding In this unhinged worldview, politicians as different as Jeremy Corbyn, Sigmar Gabriel, Francois Fillon and Viktor Orban are branded pro Russian ùWhich is, frankly, insane Then we have the Russian media There s also a lot of mental gymnastics taking place when it comes to Moscow funded broadcasters like RT and Sputnik On the one hand, we have analysts claiming that the former s viewing figures are negligible and, on the other, often the same people warn that these entities are a danger to western civilization as we know it It has now gotten so ridiculous that Westminster and Washington have held committees of inquiry What seems to be forgotten is that almost every major country in the world has its own foreign TV channels these days America boasts RFE/RL and VoA (which have a budget around three times higher than RT), Paris and Berlin bankroll France 24 and Deutsche Welle respectively and Britain s BBC is a staggeringly large organization which all UK households are obliged to fund via a license fee In fact, nonpayment can lead to imprisonment Indeed, the current hysteria about RT and Sputnik reminds me of the flak thrown at Al Jazeera during the heady days of the war on terror ù Back then, the Qatari station was considered sympathetic to Al Qaeda and pro Wahabi †and viewed with suspicion It is notable that since Doha and the West took the same side on the Libya, Syria and Yemeni conflicts we almost never hear anybody criticize Al Jazeera anymore Perhaps the same will be true of RT a few years from now, if Russia and the US find common ground on foreign policy One reason for RT s popularity has been its willingness to promote stories that are largely ignored by the establishment media For example, UKIP leaders were regulars on the channel at a time when the UK mainstream considered them to be fringe ùIt is now ridiculous how, instead of learning from this mistake, certain prominent figures in Britain would rather pressurize RT and force it off the airwaves Perhaps they believe that restoring the old status quo in the UK information space will prevent more movements like Brexit? ù If so, they are making the same mistake Lord Milner made in 1917 Across the West, there are a lot of very upset citizens who are tired of a neoliberal order which has gutted the middle class and condensed wealth and power into large cosmopolitan cities, while ignoring traditional heartlands Blaming Russia for this anger is absurd And it may also have a parallel to the fate of Nikolai II, who considered the Germans to be the greatest threat to his rule, when the real danger was at home Look how that ended *As it happens, Russia makes a lot of things such as rockets which launch US satellites into space, for instance It s also the world s third most popular migration destination, after the US and Germany and the population has grown in recent years In addition, Russia has a higher birthrate than most other European countries This article originallyappearedin Rethinking

Adam Garrie, political commentator:It is very interesting because the parallel you are talking about is of course the crisis of 1993 when Boris Yeltsin challenged the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation for control in his attempt to reform the constitution and change the government, after that standoff which became violent and all the leaders of the Supreme Soviet and their allies were arrested This is the first time when someone who is in government has been detained or be it under different circumstances Now it is well to remember that in 1994 after the crisis all of the people were freed, and in 1995 all of the charges were dropped and those things due to efforts of the new parties elected to the Duma, including and especially in that case the LDPR which is now the third largest party in the Duma today This situation is a bit different though because as opposed to an existential, philosophical and metaphysical crisis over the nature of government and a power grab, this is about corruption and it is allegedly corruption at an incredibly high level We are talking about $2 million that the minister is alleged to have taken in bribes So, what happened in 1993 was about systematic disagreements on who and how the state should be run, this is about an alleged high crime in this case, bribery READ MORE: Russian anti corruption boss alleged to have 300mn in Swiss banks, after $120mn found at his flat This is obviously nothing unique to Russia, right now president elect Trump is debating whether to detain and arrest the person who almost became the president of the US, Hillary Clinton So, in this sense we see corruption at the high levels of politics in all countries I think the drive to root out corruption is very important, I think that these arrests are absolutely essential Local government in all countries is usually the most corrupt; the same goes for regional government So, it is not surprising that you see governors arrested prior to an actual government minister of the national government arrested But I think it is important because this sort of scandal, this sort of bribery can t be tolerated And I think in the drive to make politics more open and transparent, this needs to be done and I think the next step is opening the books of some of the major members of the Duma and see what they are doing as well Charges against Ulyukayev require serious evidence î Kremlin spokesmanhttps:// tdotco /EjRxZ0l3az RT:Is the economic development minister being made an example? Is this a sign of progress, will others follow suit? AG:I think it is necessary The idea that people in government are somehow above the law makes a mockery of government, but the people in government should be absolutely subject to the law, should be under even deeper scrutiny than the ordinary citizens and businessmen These people have entrusted in their power the lives, the economic welfare and the security of ordinary citizens So, it is absolutely right for the law enforcement officials, the prosecutors and for judges to take these matters absolutely seriously But that is not going to effect the stability of the country Russia is a mighty nation and like any great state, be it Russia, China, America, these states can function perfectly well even while rooting out corruption It s is a very important step, ùMartin McCauley, author and Russia analyst said commenting on the news Aleksey Ulyukayev is a very well known liberal economist, former Deputy Chairperson of the Central Bank of Russia; he has been there since I remember him from the Yeltsin era He is a very high profile economist, one of the people who regulates the Russian economy, and to find that he has been nailed for apparently accepting $2 million bribe is in fact quite shocking that a top economist and minister should in fact engage in this But if you look at corruption in the Russian economy, Vladimir Putin keeps on saying it is like a cancer of our economy This is quite correct because the official version is that 10 percent of the GDP is lost through corruption That is $150 billion But other analysts double that $300 billion are siphoned off from the Russian economy every year through corruption Next year s budget looks forward to a $30 billion deficit So, if they claw back 10 percent of that $300 billion, then they can balance the budget So, therefore, this is a very important move if they can in fact clamp down on it and get back some of the money ù     ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/367013-ulyukayev-corruption-russia-economy-bribe/

 import and commercialization of genetically modified organisms
 (GMO) in the Russian Federation That is commendable to be sure,
 but new evidence suggests that the health and safety dangers of
 the GMO assault on our food quality involve the paired
 agrichemicals that are used in almost all GMO seeds today, namely
 Monsanto Roundup and other glysophate based weed killers In December 2013, Professor Irina Ermakova, vice president of
 Russia s National Association for Genetic Safety, together with a
 group of Russian scientists, called on the government to impose a
 10 year ban or moratorium in order that the influence of GMOs and
 their chemical herbicides can be thoroughly studied for their
 influence on human health Ermakova some years beforeconductedGMO rat feeding tests that showed alarming
 results, including extreme mortality rates It is necessary
 to ban GMO, to impose a moratorium for 10 years While GMO will
 be prohibited, we can plan experiments, tests, or maybe even new
 methods of research could be developed, ùErmakova said It has beenprovedthat not only in Russia, but also in many other
 countries in the world, GMO is dangerous Methods of obtaining
 the GMO are not perfect, therefore, at this stage, all GMOs are
 dangerous, Ermakova added At a congress of United Russia deputies from Russian rural
 villages in Volgograd on April 5, 2014, Medvedevexpressedhis clearest opposition to GMOs to date 
 He stated that Russia will not import GMO products If the
 Americans like to eat GMO products, let them eat it then We
 don t need to do that; we have enough space and opportunities to
 produce organic food, ùhe said At the end of February, the Russian parliament asked the
 government to impose a temporary ban on all genetically altered
 products in Russia The Russian State Duma s Agriculture
 Committee backed a ban on the registration and trade of
 genetically modified organisms Indicating support for Ermakova s
 call, they suggested that until specialists develop a working
 system of control over the effects of GMOs on humans and the
 natural environment, the government should impose a moratorium on
 the breeding and growth of genetically modified plants, animals
 and microorganisms Research indicates strongly that the chemical toxins in the
 herbicide Roundup sold in combination with every Monsanto GMO
 plant, as well as most every other, is in fact more toxic to
 humans than reported And that, in concentrations far lower than
 in doses used in the family garden spraying The evidence points
 clearly to the fact that the agrichemical industry has engaged in
 a criminal cover up of these dangers Published scientific research results suggest horrifying
 corroboration of just that Yet the EU s designated food health
 and safety oversight body, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),
 and EU governments, to say nothing of the US Food and Drug
 Authority (FDA), insist on not looking into what could be one of
 the major sources of ghastly new rises in diseases, illnesses and
 even death in both the EU and the US and other places where
 Roundup is widely used In September 2012, Professor Gilles Eric Seralini and his
 research team at France s Caen University published a
 peer reviewed, first ever, two year study of effects of feeding
 rats not only GMO Monsanto NK603 Roundup tolerant maize, but also
 of Monsanto s herbicide Roundup The results were so alarming
 that the corrupt EU Commission and the even more corrupt
 scientists of the EFSA scrambled to come up with a way to
 discredit that study A spokesman for the EFSA announced just a few weeks after the
 publication of Seralini s bombshell study and without proof, EFSA s analysis has shown that deficiencies in the S√©ralini
 et al paper mean it is of insufficient scientific quality for
 risk assessment We believe the completion of this evaluation
 process has brought clarity to the issue ùThe EFSA
 spokesman went on to make the following startling statement: Serious defects in the design and methodology of a paper by
 S√©ralini et al mean it does not meet acceptable scientific
 standards and there is no need to re examine previous safety
 evaluations of genetically modified maize NK603 ù No mention of what the serious defects ùnor of why that
 would not call for repeating the two year tests with other
 independent scientific groups around the EU to determine whether
 or not Seralini s results were accurate Shockingly, EFSA
 declared that no further tests of Monsanto maize were warranted Case closed, ladies and gentlemen and don t ask us for more
 on this ù The mainstream media in Germany and across the EU dutifully
 swallowed that nonsense as the end of the discussion Monsanto
 maize and Monsanto Roundup herbicide were safe ù Monsanto even managed to get one of its own people into the
 editorial board of the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology
 which printed the initial Seralini study Richard E Goodman, a
 former Monsanto employee who was later with the Monsanto backed
 pro GMO lobby organization, International Life Sciences Institute
 (ILSI), was named to an entirely new post at the magazine six
 months after the Seralini study release, as Associate Editor
 for Biotechnology ù One of Goodman s first acts was to withdraw the Seralini article 
 He did so in violation of the guidelines for retractions in
 scientific publishing set out by the Committee on Publication
 Ethics (COPE) For any peer reviewed scientific article to be
 withdrawn there must be clear evidence that the findings are
 unreliable due to misconduct (e g data fabrication) or honest
 error; plagiarism or redundant publication; or unethical
 research None of those were proven in the Seralini case In another review of published studies on the toxicity of the
 chemical herbicide used with almost all GMO plants, Anthony
 Samsel and Stephanie Seneff in the US, have found more
 confirmations the Seralini warnings about the toxic dangers of
 Monsanto Roundup Their review concluded, in regard to glyphosate, the main active
 component of Roundup herbicide, that, Residues (of
 glyphosate w e ) are found in the main foods of the Western diet,
 comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat Glyphosate's
 inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked
 component of its toxicity to mammals CYP enzymes play crucial
 roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics Thus,
 glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne
 chemical residues and environmental toxins Negative impact on
 the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as
 inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body ù The conclusions, in short, are that Roundup, the most widely used
 weed killer in the world, is found in the main foods we
 eat îsugar, corn, soy and wheat Its main component, glyphosate,
 inhibits the enzyme of the human body that plays a crucial
 biological role detoxifying xenobiotics, and thereby exaggerates
 the toxic effects of other chemical residues in our
 chemically saturated industrial foods or other environmental
 toxins Its damaging effects accumulate slowly so we do not
 realize until it is too late Xenobiotics is the generic term
 referring to any foreign chemical substance found within an
 organism that is not normally naturally produced, such as
 antibiotics or other foreign chemicals Today some 80 percent of genetically modified crops, especially
 maize, soy, canola, cotton, sugar beets and most recently
 alfalfa, are specifically genetically modified to accept
 introduction of genes resistant to glyphosate, the so called Roundup Ready Æ feature ù Monsanto and the agribusiness industry falsely claim Roundup and
 glyphosate is less toxic than aspirin That has conveniently
 insured that the US government makes no special study of the
 toxicity dangers of Roundup or glyphosate herbicides, despite
 their massive increased usage in US agriculture since the
 mid 1990s, when GMO commercial seeds began to spread across North
 American corn and soybean fields to where today they account for
 almost 100 percent of all soybeans and near 90 percent of all
 corn planted in the US In EU countries, owing to a convenient labeling loophole, that
 GMO corn and soybean cocktail is imported as power feed ù for
 animals from the US or Argentina and Brazil and fed to most beef,
 dairy, pigs and chickens consumed in the EU And all of it is
 saturated with Roundup or other glyphosate chemical toxins Few
 people are aware because of absence of labeling requirements Samsel and Seneff report: [M]any of the health problems that
 appear to be associated with a Western diet could be explained by
 biological disruptions that have already been attributed to
 glyphosate These include digestive issues, obesity, autism,
 Alzheimer s disease, depression, Parkinson s disease, liver
 diseases and cancer, among others While many other environmental
 toxins obviously also contribute to these diseases and
 conditions, we believe that glyphosate may be the most
 significant environmental toxin, mainly because it is pervasive
 and it is often handled carelessly due to its perceived
 nontoxicity ù(added emphasis w e ) Finally, they state, glyphosate may be a significant factor
 in the observed increased risk to Clostridium botulinum infection
 in cattle in Germany over the past 10 to 15 years Glyphosate's
 demonstrated toxicity to Enterococcus spp leads to an imbalance
 in the gut favoring overgrowth of the toxic Clostridium species 
 Glyphosate has been shown to have remarkable adverse effects on
 the gut biota in poultry, by reducing the number of beneficial
 bacteria and increasing the number of pathogenic bacteria in the
 gut Highly pathogenic strains of Salmonella and Clostridium were
 found to be highly resistant to glyphosate ù The final decision in Russia s parliament is under intense
 discussion but the move to an outright ban on GMO food crops in
 Russia and imports of GMO corn, soya and other products appears
 to have strong backing The timing of Medvedev s remarks in
 Volgograd may well be a sly Russian slap in Washington s face for
 the US backed coup in Ukraine Regardless, it is clearly a good
 move Russia by no means stands alone in its action against GMO On
 April 12, the US National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA)
 reported that China s ban on US corn containing traces of
 unapproved GMO maize caused a significant drop in US exports that
 has cost US grain traders $427 million in sales Last November,
 the Chinese government banned imports of corn containing GMO or
 residues of GMO after their discovery of the MIR162 genetically
 modified corn strain in US shipments The strain was developed by
 the Swiss British Syngenta, and has not been approved for import
 by Chinese authorities since the company filed an application for
 approval in March 2010 Before the banon the Syngenta strain, China
 was the US s third largest importer of US corn It s not just Ermakova and leading Russian scientists who are
 calling for far more independent research on the possible toxic
 effects of Roundup and glyphosate on animals Next month there
 will again be a worldwide grassroots March against Monsanto ù to
 heighten public awareness about the dangers of GMO As citizens
 and human beings we have an inalienable right to know how our
 food is produced, engineered, and if it is poisoned or not Until
 such time, all farmers should voluntarily cease using glyphosate
 herbicides and concerned citizens should call on the government
 to ban its sale until conclusively proven safe or not The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/154000-toxic-herbicide-gmo-monsanto/
"24 Mar, 2014",15 years on: Looking back at NATO's ‚Äòhumanitarian‚Äô bombing of Yugoslavia,"Exactly 15 years ago, on March 24, NATO began its 78 day bombing of Yugoslavia The alliance bypassed the UN under a humanitarian ù pretext, launching aggression that claimed hundreds of civilian lives and caused a much larger catastrophe than it averted NATO bombings of Yugoslavia in 15 dramatic
 photos Years on, Serbia still bears deep scars of the NATO bombings
 which, as the allianceput it, were aimed at preventing instability
 spreading ù in Kosovo Questions remain on the very legality of
 the offense, which caused casualties and mass destruction in the
 Balkan republic Codenamed Operation Allied Force, it was the largest attack
 ever undertaken by the alliance It was also the first time that
 NATO used military force without the approval of the UN Security
 Council and against a sovereign nation that did not pose a real
 threat to any member of the alliance NATO demonstrated in 1999 that it can do whatever it wants under
 the guise of humanitarian intervention, ù war on
 terror, ù or preventive war ù something that
 everyone has witnessed in subsequent years in different parts of
 the globe Nineteen NATO member states participated to some degree in the
 military campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
 (Serbia and Montenegro), which lasted for 11 weeks until June 10,
 1999 In the course of the campaign, NATO launched 2,300 missiles at
 990 targets and dropped 14,000 bombs, including depleted uranium
 bombs and cluster munitions (unexploded cluster bombs continued
 to pose a threat to people long after the campaign was over )
 Over 2,000 civilians were killed, including 88 children, and
 thousands more were injured Over 200,000 ethnic Serbs were
 forced to leave their homeland in Kosovo In what the alliance described as collateral damage, ù its
 airstrikes destroyed more than 300 schools, libraries, and over
 20 hospitals At least 40,000 homes were either completely
 eliminated or damaged and about 90 historic and architectural
 monuments were ruined That is not to mention the long term harm
 caused to the region s ecology and, therefore, people s health,
 as well as the billion dollar economic damage News correspondents Anissa Naouai and Jelena Milincic, the
 authors ofRT s documentary Zashto? which means
 Why? ù in English traveled through former Yugoslavia to
 Belgrade, Kosovo, and Montenegro and spoke to people who endured
 the atrocities and horrors of the war and lost their friends and
 relatives There is a bridge near the city of Nis, which was bombed at
 the time when a passenger train was passing through it, ùMilincic recalls The tragedy on April 12, 1999 killed 15 people
 and wounded 44 others, while many passengers were never accounted
 for We felt the blast and saw flames under the locomotive The
 train was blown so powerfully, half a meter from the ground I
 don t know how we stayed on the rails, ù recalled witness
 Boban Kostic Our colleague got off the train when I did, ù he said 
 He was really scared But another rocket hit and blew him to
 pieces, ù added another witness, Goran Mikic Why? Why civilians? Why a train? ù said Dragan Ciric 
 It still torments me, if the first rocket was a mistake,
 what were the next three for? ù he told RT The Chinese embassy in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade was also
 hit and set on fire by NATO airstrikes on May 7, 1999 Three
 citizens of the country were killed The alliance called the
 attack a mistake ù China is a permanent member of the
 UN Security Council and, along with Russia, did not support a
 military solution for the Kosovo crisis Prior to the military assault, the Milosevic regime was accused
 of excessive and disproportionate use of force in
 Kosovo ù But was the force that NATO used when bombing the
 sovereign state s territory proportionate and restrained? Rights
 organization Amnesty International accused the allied forces of
 committing war crimes Indications are that NATO did not always meet its legal
 obligations in selecting targets and in choosing means and
 methods of attack, On the basis of available evidence, including
 NATO s own statements and accounts of specific incidents, Amnesty
 International believes that whatever their intentions NATO
 forces did commit serious violations of the laws of war leading
 in a number of cases to the unlawful killings of civilians, ù
 the rights watchdog said in areportpublished in June 2000 The alliance dismissed the accusations, saying that cases
 involving civilian deaths were due to technological failure or
 were simply accidents of conflict ù NATO failed to say that they
 were due to the alliance s own failure to take all necessary
 precautions We never said we would avoid casualties It would be
 foolhardy to say that, as no military operation in history has
 been perfect, ù said Jamie Shea, NATO s chief spokesman, the
 Guardian reported at the time Former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered military
 action against Yugoslavia following a failure in negotiations on
 the Kosovo crisis in France s Rambouillet and Paris in February
 and March 1999 NATO s decision was officially announced after talks between
 international mediators known as the Contact Group the
 Yugoslav government, and the delegation of Kosovo Albanians ended
 in a deadlock Belgrade refused to allow foreign military
 presence on its territory while Albanians accepted the proposal Back then, Slobodan Milosevic s forces were engaged in armed
 conflict with an Albanian rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army
 (KLA), which sought the province s separation from Yugoslavia 
 Former US President Bill Clinton s special envoy to the Balkans,
 Robert Gelbard, had earlier described the KLA as without any
 questions, a terrorist group ù (The KLA was later repeatedly
 accused of being involved in the organ trafficking of Serbs in
 the late 1990s ) However, despite not announcing the link officially, NATO entered
 the conflict on the side of the KLA, accusing Serbian security
 forces of atrocities and ethnic cleansing ù against
 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo The main objective of the campaign
 was to make Milosevic s forces pull out of the province The fact
 that there was violence on both sides of the confrontation was
 ignored both by allied governments and Western media which
 stirred up public anger by focusing only on Serbs atrocities and
 being far less vocal regarding abuses by Albanians All efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to
 the Kosovo crisis having failed, no alternative is open but to
 take military action, ù Solana said on March 23, 1999 
 We must halt the violence and bring an end to the
 humanitarian catastrophe now unfolding in Kosovo ù An incident involving the mass killing ù of Albanians in
 central Kosovo s village of Racak a KLA stronghold became a
 major excuse and justification for NATO s decision to start its
 operation Serbs were blamed for the deaths of dozens of Albanian civilians ùon January 15, 1999 However, it was alleged
 that the accusations could have been false and the bodies
 actually belonged to KLA insurgents whose clothes had been
 changed A central role in labeling the events in Racak a
 massacre ù belonged to William Walker, who headed the OSCE
 Kosovo Verification Mission He visited the site shortly after
 the incident and made his judgment [Walker] arrived there having no powers to make conclusions
 regarding what had happened, ùRussian Foreign Minister
 Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazenta paper
 in November last year Yugoslav authorities accused Walker of going beyond his mission
 and proclaimed him persona non grata, while Western leaders were
 infuriated over the Racak incident And some time later the bombing started, ù Lavrov
 recalled, adding that the situation in Racak became the trigger point ùMoscow insisted that an investigation
 should be carried out The EU commissioned a group of Finnish
 forensic experts to prepare a report on the incident Later, the
 European Union handed it over to the International Criminal
 Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Lavrov said The full version
 of the document has never been made public, said the minister,
 who was Moscow s permanent representative to the UN between 1994
 and 2004 But parts of the report leaked and were quoted in the media
 saying that [the victims] were not civilians and that all the
 bodies found in Racak were in disguise and that bullet holes on
 clothes and bodies did not match There was also no one who was
 killed at short range, ù Lavrovsaid Even though I ve repeatedly raised this
 issue, the report itself still has not been shown ù NATO halted its air campaign with the signing of the Military
 Technical Agreement in Kumanovo on June 9, 1999, with the
 Yugoslav government agreeing to withdraw its forces from Kosovo 
 On June 10, 1999, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1244
 to establish the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
 (UNMIK) In August 2013, Amnesty Internationalaccusedthe UNMIK of failing to properly
 investigate the abductions and murders of Kosovo Serbs in the
 aftermath of the 1998 1999 war Years have passed and the fate of the majority of the
 missing on both sides of the conflict is still unresolved, with
 their families still waiting for justice, ù the organization
 said Moscow s former envoy to NATO (1997 2002), Viktor Zavarzin,
 believes the military alliance s aggression was a crime
 against humanity ù and a violation of international laws

"21 Feb, 2013","‚ÄòBroken phone‚Äô fixed, Lavrov and Kerry to meet next week","Russian Human Rights Commissioner Konstantin Dolgov confirmed on Thursday that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would meet with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Berlin, Germany on Feb 26 The meeting comes after it was reported by the Western media
that Kerry failed to reach Lavrov via telephone on two separate
occasions last week, causing analysts to speculate on the condition
of the Russia US relationship However, the Russian Foreign Ministry rejected the claim that two
attempts were made to reach Lavrov, saying that Kerry had made just
one attempt, but, according to Foreign Minister spokesperson
Alexander Lukashenko, the conversation could not be held ùbecause Lavrov was touring African countries at the time The outspoken leader of the Russian LibDem Party (LPDR), Vladimir
Zhirinovsky joked about Kerry s failure to reach Lavrov, suggesting
that the US Secretary of State was desperately attempting to reach
the Russian diplomat to warn of a new US weapon test that had gone
awry and was heading for Russian territory Zhirinovsky was referring to last week s spectacular meteorite
explosion that lit up the skies over the Russian town of
Chelyabinsk It will be Kerry s first official trip abroad after taking over
from Hillary Clinton as the new US Secretary of State, and there
will be much to discuss between the two veteran statesmen Dolgov, speaking at a meeting of the State Duma committee on the
family announced that Lavrov told informed him that the question of
the rights of Russian children adopted by American families would
be one of the main talking points The comment came just hours after it was reported that another
adoptive Russian child died in the United States I spoke with Sergey Lavrov just before coming here, and he
asked me to stress that this issue, primarily the death of Maxim
Kuzmin, will be among the key issues on the agenda of his
negotiations with Kerry scheduled for next week, Dolgov
said The Human Rights Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry said Russia
was not informed promptly enough about Kuzmin s death Meanwhile, US officials have declared their willingness to maintain
cooperation with Russia, particularly the Russian embassy in
Washington, to determine the details of the tragedy, he said There have been certain assurances from the U S that they are
keeping this situation under special control and will be doing all
they can at the State Department to provide us with all the
necessary information and do whatever they can so that this case be
investigated properly, Dolgov said Kuzmin was adopted by a US family from the same orphanage as Dmitry
Yakovlev, the child who died from heatstroke in 2008 after being
left unattended inside of a car by his American parents Yakovlev s
name has been given to a Russian law that prohibits the adoption of
Russian children by US citizens, which took effect at the end of
2012 Meanwhile, other pressing international issues will certainly be
discussed by Lavrov and Kerry, including the two year conflict in

"13 Feb, 2013",Reset redux: Washington‚Äôs ‚Äòsecret letter‚Äô to Moscow provokes speculation,"Alexei Pushkov, the head of the State Duma committee on international affairs, believes that a top Washington aide will deliver to Moscow offers on nuclear disarmament in an upcoming visit The US president s National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon is expected to arrive in Moscow in February, ùPushkov told a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday He is expected to bring a so called secret letter The leading Russian politician, while admitting that no one knows what this letter will say, ùsaid he believes it will contain some proposals in the sphere of disarmament, including nuclear US President Barack Obama s Global Zero campaign, which proponents praise as visionary and critics ridicule as wishful thinking, largely hinges on what Russia, also a nuclear superpower, thinks about the plan Pushkov slammed Obama s efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as pure propaganda and a romantic idea, reminiscent of Khrushchev s suggestion of universal and complete disarmament in 1961 ù The high ranking politician from the United Russia party argued that for some countries, like Israel, nuclear weapons are non negotiable: There is one country to which nuclear armaments are absolutely critical; this is Israel Israel will never discard the nuclear deterrence potential because it is surrounded by the potentially hostile Arab world ù President Obama s Global Zero campaign ends in Israel before it even starts, Pushkov said, adding that other countries have made colossal investments ùin nuclear arms, and will simply not abandon them This results in a large footnote being attached to Obama s campaign for eliminating nuclear weapons from the military equation: Washington s decision to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, just miles from the Russian border Despite earlier pledges to cooperate with Russia on the system, US and NATO officials now seem prepared to alienate Moscow over the project, risking nothing less than another arms race ùas Russia will have no alternative but to strengthen its deterrent capabilities, Pushkov said Moscow s concerns come down to basic military strategy: As long as the US and NATO continue to pursue missile defense without Russia s cooperation, efforts to bilaterally reduce nuclear weapons will falter Indeed, Moscow has made it clear that it reserves the right to quit the New START agreement an arms control treaty signed between Russia and the US and ratified on April 8, 2010, limiting the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads on both sides to 1,550 if it is decided that the missile defense system poses a threat to the strategic balance The US missile defense system is surely one of the key issues on today s agenda because it involves Russia s vital interests, ù President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with RT But naturally, as our American partners proceed with developing their own missile defense we shall have to think of how we can defend ourselves and preserve the strategic balance ùThe Obama administration s multibillion dollar missile defense system, ostensibly designed to protect Europe and the US from a rogue missile attack, was criticized in an unclassified report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as potentially unfeasible, ù the Associated Press reported last week US military officials declined requests to discuss the study on the record, noting the material was classified, according to AP Another factor that may cause Washington to reconsider its missile defense plans is Iran, which Washington has argued is the main reason it is building its missile defense system in Europe The US and Israel, among other countries, believe that Tehran is secretly developing a nuclear weapons program Iran has denied the claims, and maintained that its nuclear program is aimed at providing a new source of energy for its civilian sector The United States has changed its tone regarding Iran, Pushkov said Whereas before many discussed a military scenario, at the Munich Security Conference US President Joseph Biden placed emphasis on a diplomatic solution At the Munich conference in early February, Biden underlined that Iran, which has been hit hard by a stiff international sanctions regime, need not sentence their people to economic deprivation and international isolation ù There is still time, there is still space for diplomacy backed by pressure to succeed, ù Biden said The ball is in the government of Iran s court Pushkov recalled that Biden mentioned what he described as a window of opportunities, but at the same time warned that these opportunities were not infinite The Russian MP emphasized that while Russia is against a nuclear armed Iran, it is equally opposed to any military scenario ù to resolve the matter Russia is not interested in a nuclear Iran, because then other countries in the region will be interested in having nuclear arms, too, ù he warned But we reject the military scenario, because it would be a great evil Discussing the so called Russia US reset, which Pushkov said has exhausted itself, ù he noted that the relationship has entered a phase of reformatting ù While acknowledging the achievements between Washington and Moscow including partnership in Afghanistan, Russia s accession to the WTO and the signing of a nuclear arms reduction treaty Pushkov held out hope that the Russia US relationship would get back on track in 2013 Saying that he did not personally regret the resignation of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Pushkov expressed hopes that Clinton s replacement, John Kerry, will not be an ideologically driven politician ù If Chuck Hagel is approved as Pentagon chief, he is also known as [a] political realist, Pushkov said, adding that a Kerry Hagel tandem could have a positive effect on Russia US relations In any case the reset has fulfilled its tasks, but failed to resolve, in particular, such area of disagreement as missile defense ùRobert Bridge, RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-us-pushkov-moscow-nuclear-global-zero-100/
"30 Jan, 2013",‚ÄòRussia is ending its dependency on the global superpower‚Äô ‚Äì Pushkov,"Moscow announced that it has terminated an agreement with Washington to cooperate in law and drug enforcement, continuing the trend of deteriorating diplomatic relations Russia is reforming its relationship with the US We have terminated the third agreement with the U S in the last six months, ù Aleksey Pushkov, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Lower House, commented on Twitter Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed an order to terminate the bilateral deal, the government said in a statement on its official website on Wednesday The agreement, formalized between Russia and the US on September 25, 2002, was declared out of touch with today s realities and has exhausted its potential, ù the statement read The Russian Foreign Ministry has been instructed to notify Washington of the decision As part of the now defunct bilateral deal, the US agreed to provide financial assistance to relevant Russian entities for anti crime measures, among other activities Such philanthropy, however, has raised eyebrows in Russia and prompted questions over the real motive behind Washington s efforts It was largely due to these suspicions that Moscow informed the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in September that its services in Russia were no longer wanted or needed In a recent interview with NPR, outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented on Russia s decision to shut down the USAID office: We can take our aid money and go elsewhere and help people who welcome us ùClinton s comment goes far towards explaining the rift in Russia US relations: Russia has largely escaped from the clutches of its post Soviet depression, and now has a dynamic economy with a growing middle class and huge natural resources The message from Moscow is that Russia no longer needs handouts from Washington The Foreign Ministry said that Russian civil society has become fully mature, and did not need any external direction from USAID, which was also blamed for attempting to manipulate Russia s internal political processes Is Washington, feeling a bit like a jaded partner in a tumultuous relationship, seeking to break off the honeymoon in dramatic fashion?Last year, the decision by a group of US legislators to implement the so called Magnitsky Act against specific Russian officials who the US Senators believe should be held accountable in the death of Sergey Magnitsky, an accountant with Hermitage Capital who died in prison in 2009 amidst a tax evasion investigation has triggered a diplomatic domino effect between the two countries Shortly after the passage of the Magnitsky Act, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the Dima Yakovlev bill, which bans American citizens from adopting Russian orphans In an interview with US media, Prime Minister Medvedev emphasized that Russia s decision to introduce the adoption legislation had no connection with US legislation against Russian citizens This law expresses concerns of the Russian parliament, the Russian State Duma and the Federal Council over destiny of our children Therefore, despite the fact that many saw it as targeting individual American citizens who want to adopt Russian children, that s certainly not the case, ù Medvedev told CNN The US also recently said it would end its cooperation in the Russian American Bilateral Presidential Commission on Civil Society This ongoing atmosphere of animosity between the two former Cold War rivals shows that relations between Moscow and Washington have entered a cooling period It also shows that Russia is less willing to depend on the United States for services that it can afford on its own Meanwhile, Russian experts say that relations between Moscow and Washington have entered a dangerous tit for tat stage and warned against further escalation †Honorary chairman of the Foreign and Defense Policy Council, Sergey Karaganov told RIA Novosti news agency that in his view Russia and US have put themselves on a path that is very difficult to step off At the same time, the analyst noted that the so called reset had not created any solid foundation for better relations between the two countries Karaganov added that he hoped that the leaders of the two nations would be wise enough not to allow further deterioration in relations Viktor Kuvaldin of the Gorbachev Foundation also urged the leaders of Russia and the United States to put an end to the standoff as soon as possible Unfortunately, when a spiral starts unwinding it acquires its own logic People tend to forget who started what and resort to the eye for an eye tooth for a tooth policy, Kuvaldin said Russian authorities should stop the process and reach an agreement with their US partners so that they (Washington) would follow suit Robert Bridge, RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-us-moscow-medvedev-clinton-071/
"29 Dec, 2012","‚ÄòUS, Russia plunging into new Cold War‚Äô","Tit for tat moves between Russia and the US are plunging the two nations into a new Cold War, says Russia expert Stephen Cohen Washington s longtime policy towards Moscow is to blame for the growing tensions The reset in relations between the United States and Russia is dead, as the Obama administration has never truly cooperated with Moscow, instead pushing the same policy Washington has been imposing on Russia for the past 20 years, † Stephen F Cohen † professor of Russian Studies and History at New York University and Princeton University told RT That policy is advancing NATO toward Russia s borders, building missile defense on Russia s borders, interfering in Russia s internal politics ù RT: After the US Senate passed the controversial [Magnitsky] bill, Russia accused Washington of engaging in Cold War tactics Now that Moscow has retaliated, how would you describe the two countries relations?Stephen Cohen: Increasingly we are plunging into a new Cold War But it s not a surprise The story of the orphans doesn t begin with the Magnitsky Bill Number of us in the United States have been warning since the 1990s nearly 20 years that unless Washington changed its policy, its kind of winner take all policy after the Cold War policy toward Moscow, that we would drift toward Cold War, not toward the partnership we all hoped for 20 years ago This is just the last stage I wouldn t say it s inevitable But even though the tragedy of those orphans already adopted in effect who now will not be able to join their families in America is foremost in our minds especially on the Christmas Eve and the eve of the New Year A real honest, analytical approach by an American patriot † as I am † is that Washington bears a large part of responsibly because of the policies it pursued toward Moscow And what we saw in the Russian Duma and in the Russian Higher House the Federal Assembly when virtually every deputy voted in favor of the ban on American adoption, which was just signed by Putin, is an outburst of pent up of anti American feeling in Moscow which has been caused not only, but in large measure by American policy RT: How much is this dispute actually just political saber rattling and how will it actually impact the children?SC: There is an old Russian saying Words are also deeds ù A lot of people in Moscow and in Washington when they passed the Magnitsky Act and now the ban on adoption in Moscow may have though that they werejust talking, showing off, playing grandstanding But these words have consequences They have backed, they have fueled this new Cold War atmosphere which is enveloping the relationship between our two countries Each going to affect American relations with Russia regarding Afghanistan, regarding missile defense, regarding Syria, regarding Iran these are very serious matters The angrier people get, the more resentment people have on both sides, the worse is the situation For example, anti Putin feeling in America is irrational, completely irrational There has been a kind of demonization of Putin in America Some of us tried to counter it by beginning a rational discourse about Putin as a leader We are not pro Putin, we just see him as a national leader who needs to be understood But these events the Magnitsky and the orphan act are going to make it impossible to have a discourse in America about Putin s leadership in a way that would lead to any cooperation between Obama and Putin RT: With the US and Russia exchanging tit for tat actions, what possible further moves can we expect?SC: There was some surprise in America because our legislature does not think about the consequences of what it does Many people thought that the Russian reaction to the Magnitsky Bill would be for Moscow to start selling its dollars, for example, and try to harm the American economy or perhaps that Moscow would reduce its cooperation with the United States in supplying NATO troops fighting in Afghanistan So many people were surprised that the orphan issue became the retaliation But there are two issues here that are interesting: In the beginning President Putin did not seem to favor the ban on American adoptions, but he signed the bill after it turned out that almost every member of this parliament favored it It is also said that President Obama did not favor the Magnitsky Bill, but he signed it when it turned out that almost every member of Congress favored it So it may be that we are exaggerating the power both of Putin and Obama RT: The reset button was pressed in 2009 † but how much has really changed in ties between Washington and Moscow?SC: I see Obama s reset is what we the older generation used to call when we were in a Cold War a detente meaning an attempt to reduce Cold War conflict by replacing it with cooperation I think there was a lost opportunity When Obama and then President Medvedev entered into the reset, Moscow wanted certain things from Washington and Washington wanted certain things from Moscow Without going into the detail Washington got everything from Moscow it wanted and Moscow got nothing So the reset has been dead for several months, maybe a year RT: During the US Presidential elections, Barack Obama had been accused by his Republican counterpart of being soft on Russia Could the latest decision mean he s changing his stance?SC: The Republicans said that because they were prepared to say anything negative they could think about Obama in order to defeat him But he reality is that Obama has continued the policy toward Moscow begun by President Clinton, a Democrat, and continued by PresidentBush, a Republican That policy is advancing NATO toward Russia s borders, building missile defense on Russia s borders, interfering in Russia s internal politics, most recently the street demonstrations This is the same policy that began 20 year ago with the Soviet Union The fundamental American policy toward Russia has not changed So it s ridiculous to call Obama soft on Moscow Just because two leaders get together as they always do and say we are friends † it doesn t mean anything The reality is that the partnership we need between Washington and Moscow to make the world safer for all of us has not existed since the Soviet Union ended And we may be farther from it today as a result

"24 Dec, 2012","Lavrov: ‚ÄòEither secure Syria's chemical weapons, or arm its rebels‚Äô (EXCLUSIVE)","Russia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tells RT that Western powers habit of dividing terrorists between bad and acceptable could have lasting consequences for the whole world Syria s chemical arsenal has become a central point of international concern since the country s civil conflict flared up in March 2011 Syria is reportedly in possession of nerve agents including mustard gas, while NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen has already accused the country s government of deploying the Scud missiles needed to deliver it The worst case scenario, as acknowledged by many governments including the US, would be for the weapons to fall into the hands of Syria s various opposition groups some of whom are affiliated with al Qaeda But to date Syria s chemical arsenal is secure, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RT in an exclusive interview Every time we hear rumors, or pieces of information come to the surface that the Syrians are doing something with the chemical weapons, we double check, we triple check, ù says Lavrov, adding that the latest move concerning the chemical weapons was related to the Syrian government s intent to gather and consolidate the dispersed arsenal in order to make sure that it is absolutely ù protected However, Lavrov says it shows a strange logic ù when the Western powers involved in solving the Syrian crisis pin the full responsibility for the arsenal on the sitting Syrian government even if the rebels take hold of it ù and at the same time, continue to encourage the conflict by supplying the rebels with arms and money Meanwhile, Western governments have begun distinguishing between bad terrorists and acceptable terrorists ù on the ground in Syria, refusing to condemn acts of terror there, saying the overall context should be taken into account to explain why people choose terror an absolutely unacceptable, ù route, the FM continues No war can last forever, and all wars finish in the same way: parties sit down to talks This is what will happen in Syria and it should happen as soon as possible, Lavrov concluded But RT had more questions for him What to make of NATO sending Patriot missile systems to protect Turkey from a spill over of the Syrian violence? Why did US President Barack Obama sign the Magnitsky Act amid the so called relations reset ù with Russia? And should the UN Security Council be reformed? For more on all these issues, read RT s firsthand interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov: Should India get a permanent UN Security Council seat? RT: You re ending your year with a visit to India Russia has been clear in its support for India in its aspiration to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council How do you think the much criticized UN Security Council will benefit from India s participation?SL: First of all, I would say that criticism is not always warranted The latest wave of criticism was related to the fact that the Security Council allegedly cannot act on Syria By the desire to see some action on the part of the Security Council the critics wanted to pass a resolution under Chapter 7 which provides for the use of sanctions and the use of force eventually And Russia and China are convinced 100 percent that this would be a disaster and that this would be the beginning of a very slippery slope and would bring us to the Libyan scenario which we cannot afford anymore, and the region cannot afford So those who say that the Council is ineffective should recall that this Charter of the United Nations provided for the veto right not just for the sake of being nice to the permanent members but because the founding fathers of the United Nations, having digested the unhappy experience of the League of Nations decided in their wisdom that unless five great powers see eye to eye on some world issue decisions would not be efficient That s why the right of veto was included in the UN Charter on the very strong insistence of the United States Now of course the time passed since 1945, the Security Council was once expanded only in the category of non permanent members, and now after several decades of the Council functioning in the unchanged composition, there is a very strong movement towards expanding its membership to better reflect pluralism of the world community We re strongly in favor of this, we re convinced that the developing countries and first of all the new economic and financial leaders in the third world countries, like India and Brazil, for example, must be represented in the Security Council And we would be in favor of making them new permanent members, provided of course a decision is taken to create new permanent seats, because this is the biggest split in the United Nations One group of countries absolutely believes that there must be new permanent members; another group of countries which are also quite respectful members of the United Nations, categorically believes that there must be no new permanent seat and only non permanent seats could be added Russia is convinced this type of division cannot be resolved by an arithmetic vote, that there must be consensus searching, especially since it was decided some time ago that the reform of the Security Council should be subject to broad agreement of member states So any format of the reform which would be commanding general agreement of the member states would be supported by Russia It would be very unfortunate if the reform of the Security Council is voted through because this would split the membership And those who would vote against an imposed reform, in their eyes the expanded Security Council would lose legitimacy, not gain legitimacy And more legitimacy is what we all want, and that s why the Council should be more representative But in any case, while we are working very thoroughly to reach this general agreement on a reform we believe that India certainly deserves to be a permanent member of the Security Council Syria: Bad terrorists vs Acceptable terrorists? RT: Like you said, Russia is permanently blocking attempts of some of UN Security Council members to pass a resolution that would allow a foreign intervention to Syria But do you think a military action could still take place going around the UN like it happened in case of Iraq?SL: Well not only in case of Iraq but also in case of the former Yugoslavia yes, it is possible, and you just cited one example, there are some others But I also feel that those who would like to interfere in the Syrian crisis don t want to do this without some kind of legitimacy, or at least without some kind of an action in the United Nations which could be used to justify this as being legitimate And we can only stick to the interpretation of the Charter which is absolutely without any alternative and which says the Security Council is engaged in matters related to international peace and security, not to supporting one party in an internal conflict And that s what is going on in Syria Some people would like very much to internationalize this situation and to expand violence beyond the Syrian borders, attempts are being made, especially in cases when the refugees have to flee Syria because of the disproportionate actions by the government forces But on the other side, several armed groups of the opposition which are not united under a single command also resort to unacceptable methods absolutely contrary to international humanitarian law: taking hostages, staging terrorist attacks And it is very disheartening that our Western colleagues in the Security Council started to refuse condemning terrorist attacks in Syria saying that yes, terrorism is bad but you must take into account the overall context of what is going on in Syria and why people resort to terrorist attacks It s absolutely unacceptable, and if we follow this logic it might lead us to a very dangerous situation not only in the Middle East but in other parts of the world, if our partners in the West would begin to qualify terrorists as bad terroristsand acceptable terrorists Damascus to Moscow: Chemical weapons not to be used under any circumstances RT: One more reason that arises time to time that could actually okay the foreign intervention is Syria s possession of chemical weapons Do you believe that Syrian will use chemical weapons, or is this another pretext for an invasion?SL: I don t believe Syria would use chemical weapons It would be a political suicide for the government if it does Every time we hear rumors, or pieces of information come to surface that the Syrians are doing something with the chemical weapons we double check, we triple check, we go directly to the government and all the time we get very firm assurances¬† that this is not going to be used under any circumstances Our information is, which correlates with the information the Americans have, as I understand, that the latest reports about some movement of the chemical weapons were related to the steps undertaken by the government to concentrate the chemical stuff which has been dispersed in various locations into two sites, to make sure that it is absolutely protected And it is also accepted by everyone including our Western colleagues (the Europeans and the Americans) that the biggest threat in this situation is the probability that the rebels might take hold of chemical weapons And therefore, while recognizing this when our Western friends say, But still the responsibility is entirely with the Syrian government, even if the rebels take hold of it ¬† it s a very strange logic, because at the same time those very people encourage rebels not to negotiate with the government but to continue fighting and giving them arms, money, and moral and political support So, it s a very controversial position In general, the logic of those who say, No negotiations with Assad is really very controversial and very dangerous We are not justifying what the government is doing, they have been making a lot of mistakes, have been using force disproportionately; the security forces clearly were, and are, unprepared to face the public protests and armed protests in the cities and in the villages They ve been trained to counter a foreign aggression, not to keep law and order in a civilised manner But the opposition is provoking the government, as I said resorting to terrorist attacks, taking hostages, and also introducing into this conflict the sectarian dimension which is very dangerous It is already reverberating in the Muslim world Sunni, Shia, Arabs, Kurds and ethnic and confessional sectarian composition of Syria is so complex that if chaos is established there, it would reverberate all over the region But coming back to the present situation if people who say no negotiations with Assad , if they believe that his departure in whatever form is number one priority, then they must understand that for this geopolitical goal of theirs they would have to pay the price, but the price in the lives of the Syrians, of the Syrian civilians ¬† Our priority number one is not somebody s head It s the cessation of violence and of the bloodshed If they say that they want to save Syria and to save Syrians, then they should join us and should lean on all those who are fighting inside Syria to stop doing this and sit down to negotiate without any preconditions And the fate of Assad must be decided by the Syrian people, not by the outsiders and by part of the Syrian opposition RT: But different fractions of Syrian people are at war with each other, which started as an uprising and has turned into a full fledged civil war at this point The chances of these different fractions sitting down at the same negotiations table are equal to zero SL: Well, the history teaches us that every war ends with peace and this is done through negotiations It s inevitable I don t think it is conceivable that the Sunnis, who are the backbone of the Free Syrian Army and many other opposition groups who are fighting on the same side as the Free Syrian Army, would be realistically thinking of taking hold of entire Syria and throwing away all other confession groups Alawites, other Shia, Druzes, Christians, Curds In any case, even if somebody in his emotional dreams thinks of such an eventuality, this would not materialize It would not last, would not be sustainable We are not in the business of regime change RT: Do you know how from the very beginning of this conflict Russia has been heavily criticized in the West for blocking the attempts of the United States and its allies to get things right in Syria Do you think that if Russia has handled it differently from the very beginning, let s say, a year ago convinced Assad to step down, then things would be different in Syria?SL: We are not in the business of regime change Some of the regional players were suggesting to us: Why don t you tell president Assad to leave? We will arrange for some safe haven for him My answer is very simple if indeed those who suggested this to us have this in mind, they should take it directly to president Assad Why shall they use us as a postman? If president Assad is interested this must be discussed directly with him He went public for many times, including on the Arab version of your channel, saying that he is not going to leave Syria, that he was born there and he would die there with his people, that he is caring about his country and so forth Under no circumstances we would be entering the business of suggesting something to him, because, as I said, this is up to Syrian people to decide ¬† Number two our policy on Syria is not determined by what and who is saying about it, critical or otherwise We hear not only criticism but a lot of encouragement from countries who understand the importance of this issue not only for the region, but also for the world politics, for the way in which the world politics is being made and followed When the crisis started in 2011 in August a few months after the crisis started it was Russia who suggested that the Security Council react And there was a statement adopted by consensus which contained all the right things: that everyone must stop fighting and that the dialogue must begin Then in September 2011 Russia and China proposed a draft resolution which would solidify the elements, the components of the settlement, spelled out in that statement Western countries said that it was not to their liking because the opposition was asked to stop as well as the government was asked to stop So it didn t work Then we supported the Arab League plan We persuaded the Syrian government, and that was not very easy, to accept the Arab League plan We endorsed the Arab League observers to be sent to Syria and worked very thoroughly with Damascus to accept them Unfortunately, their mission was aborted for no good reason It was aborted exactly at the time when in December 2011 they submitted their first report to the Security Council which was rather on the objective side and which was not putting all the blame on the government only, but also describing the atrocities and wrongdoings by the opposition groups Then the Arab League aborted their mission Then Kofi Annan s plan appeared, and again we spent some time explaining to the government that it was in their interest to accept this plan, which was done Then the UN observers were deployed And as the relative calm started to be seen, not sustainable, but still some signs of stabilization were brought with the UN observers, then there was an upsurge of provocations in the areas where the UN observers were working and the purpose was very obvious to us The purpose was to create situation which would be unbearable for them to continue, and that was achieved So they left as well But I want to highlight that when Kofi Annan s plan was endorsed, when UN observers were deployed, the Security Council adopted, by consensus, two resolutions: 2042 and 2043, which spelled out the common position of the Security Council Which was nothing new compared to what I told you: violence must stop, dialogue must start So the Security Council was not paralyzed The Security Council did have a position, which was embraced by these two resolutions Geneva Communiqu√© still the plan for Syria And then, of course, in June this year in Geneva, there was an Action Group initiated by Kofi Annan with our very strong support, because we had been suggesting for quite some time that the key outside players meet and try to see whether they can reach a common approach to creating the conditions in which the Syrian parties could negotiate their own future, without outside interference But the external players can play an important role in creating the necessary conditions for this First of all, from the point of view of encouraging, of sending synchronized signals in the same direction: to the government and to all opposition groups, saying, for example, You must, on Day X,¬† hour Z, stop fighting, delegate your negotiators , and start negotiating the composition of what we call a transitional governing organ, to enjoy full authority during the transitional period, and make sure that government institutions do not disappear, like it happened in Iraq and we still feel the consequences now And then prepare for elections, a new constitution, and so on, and so forth And we managed, in Geneva: all the P5, (all the permanent members of the Security Council), plus the European Union, the Arab League, Turkey, the United Nations we managed to agree on this sequence We managed to agree on this sequence: stop the fighting, appoint interlocutors, let them negotiate the composition of a transitional governing organ This organ, while keeping state institutions, should prepare for elections, and draft a new constitution And we say, Fine This is a consensus, let s stick to it Let s send this message, very strongly, in synch and to all of those who are fighting ùOur Western friends, who had just signed this document, said, No, this is not enough We need to have a Security Council Chapter 7 resolution, and we need to have an addition to the scheme saying that Assad must be gone ù But this is not what we had agreed on In our tradition, when we negotiate something and when we agree on something, we respect the agreement Unfortunately, those of our partners who negotiated with us in Geneva probably have different habits And we still feel the negative effect of this So, the Geneva scheme is absolutely actual today L Brahimi, who was appointed to replace Kofi Annan, reiterated that it is the basis of his activities He attempted an initiative inviting the Russians and the Americans to discuss how the Geneva Agreement could be implemented We have been satisfied to hear an American representative say that they want a peaceful solution Syrian National Coalition s goals unachievable, principles ruinous for the country But we still cannot get any answer to a very important question The West and several regional countries¬† Turkey, the Persian Gulf states¬† have supported and recognized the Syrian National Coalition, which was formed at a meeting in Doha, and was praised as a very important step to unify the opposition We are in favour of unifying the opposition, and since the Geneva meeting we have been insisting that all those who have influence over opposition groups should help unify the opposition on the platform of the Geneva Communiqu√© And that is the message that we are sending not only to the government but to all opposition groups And we meet with all of them: just last week, there was one visiting us, and before the end of the year there might be some others coming from the opposition So, we have been sending the same message to the government and to the opposition: Guys, this is the basis Do what the Geneva Communiqu√© suggests, it s in your interests Sit down and negotiate ùBut the Doha meeting, which endorsed the Syrian National Coalition, and which was supported by the West and by important regional players, also adopted a declaration that says the main goal of the opposition is to dismantle, or rather, to topple the regime and dismantle its institutions¬† a direct opposite to what the Geneva Communiqu√© says And then they also said in that declaration, No negotiations with the regime ù Which is also against the Geneva principles When we asked our American colleagues (I talked to Hillary CLINTON on the margins of an OSCE meeting in Dublin) how they can explain their support of something that is absolutely against the principles of Geneva, she said, Well, at this stage it is important to unite them And the substance of what they want to achieve we can correct ùOne month passed Almost every week we have been enquiring what efforts are being undertaken to modify the substance: the absolute rejection of any negotiation, and absolute emphasis on the use of force And there is no answer I understand that no one is talking to the opposition regarding the need to be a bit more realistic, and regarding the need to avoid positions which are basically ruining the country Patriot missiles in Turkey: Say Syria, think Iran? RT: NATO s deployment of Patriot missiles on Turkish Syrian border is it a part of solution? And who are they really targeted at?SL: First, we understand of course the concern of Turkey and of all other countries that are continuing to receive Syrian refugees; it s a burden under any circumstances And of course, the situation is quite tense The opposition in the region, in the Syrian regions bordering Turkey is quite active, probably trying to trigger some cross border activities and then having the international community revolt against the border violations Incidents happen, and the cross border fire which took place several times we immediately were raising this issue with the Syrians, and we believe that what they explained to us is credible This was not intentional, they were chasing the opposition groups who were attacking them and then fleeing And we immediately suggested to the Turks and the Syrians that we might help to create a direct communication line so that in real time they can check whenever an incident takes place The Syrians were ready, the Turks said that they do have their own channels of communication And then this issue of Patriots was raised We recognize the right for Turkey to think about its own security and the right of Turkey to use, for this purpose, the international arrangements which Turkey has in that particular case, NATO membership, and we accepted this as a given On the other hand, the more military hardware you accumulate in one place the more risk you have that this hardware one day would be used As for the purpose of this deployment, yes, I read and hear that some experts believe that if it is intended to prevent any Syrian crossfire then it could be positioned a bit differently And as it is envisaged to be positioned, some people say it is quite useful to protect the American radar which is part of the American missile defense system they are building quoting, the threat from Iran If this is the case then it is even more risky, I would say, because this multiple purpose deployment could create additional temptations RT: It s more about Iran rather than Syria, right? SL: Well, that s what some people say And the configuration as it is being presented in the media really looks like it could be used against Iran Magnitsky Act is a Catch 22 for Obama administration RT: Syria is not the only issue between America and Russia The first thing Obama did when he got re elected was sign the so called Magnitsky Act, that would sanction Russian citizens and some Russian officials What does it tell you about the state of Russia US relations with Putin and Obama at the helm?¬†SL: I don t think this was the first thing Obama did when he was re elected This was inevitable When the senators¬† Senator Cardin and some others¬† introduced this idea, it was clearly done to create a Catch 22 for the administration Because the administration was promoting a repeal of the Jackson Vanick amendment with the support of quite a number of people on the Hill And it was absolutely obvious that the Americans want it, because with Russia having acceded to the WTO, keeping Jackson Vanick would mean depriving American companies of the benefits of the Russian Federation s membership in the WTO So they had to do it anyway And then, I think, the Republicans decided to have this trick and hinge the removal of Jackson Vanick to the Magnitsky Act Which, at that moment, was most likely done against President Obama As for the Russian citizens who have been included in that list (I haven t seen it, it still hasn t been published), if they wanted to prevent Russian citizens they don t like from entering the United States, they could do it without a adopting a law, and without making a show If they wanted to freeze anyone s assets, they could do it simply by going to court and presenting evidence¬† again, without any show or any public relations campaigns But they believed that one of the achievements that the administration had prided itself upon for the last four years was the reset with the Russian Federation And they wanted to hit Obama exactly on this reset thing It s unfortunate, because it lets domestic politics dominate the international agenda, and in the minds of many, also dominate almost everything that s happening between Russia and the United States And that is much, much more comprehensive and complex than human rights as interpreted by American senators RT: We all remember the off record conversation that Obama and Medvedev had, and Obama promised to be more flexible right after the elections But from what you are saying, how much flexible can he really be or allow himself to be with this Republican opposition in Congress?SL: Well, I think that s the peculiarities of the American system And any congressman can freeze consideration of very important issues just because the beef from his particular state is not being admitted to one country or another for phytosanitary reasons And the issues of global importance could be just frozen because of the interest of one single state in the US, and the interest having nothing to do with the substance of the issue in question You know that Jackson Vanik itself was extended repeatedly after all the emigration problems had been resolved in the former Soviet Union and of course in the Russian Federation, but the Jackson Vanik amendment was extended repeatedly under numerous pretexts, including the lack of enthusiasm on the part of our country to import those chicken legs and all sorts of thing Natan Sharansky, a famous former Soviet dissident, who has been in the Israeli government, said when he learned about that thing: It is not for the chicken legs that I spent seven years in the Soviet camp, a labor camp But this shows how the Hill can really be out of synch with logic and with realistic interpretation of the American national interests So sometimes the issues of huge importance, like the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the need to settle it, are being kept hostage for years and years because of the peculiarity of the American electoral cycles Domestic considerations, the need to be reelected prevent the American administration from doing some things which the rest of the world believes must be done Every two years they have elections And this certainly influences the international agenda, but it s very unfortunate We would prefer to approach international issues on the basis of their merit and on the basis of the crying need to do something together without looking back at your domestic politicking interests Adoption ban on US threatens losing already adopted kids out of sight RT: As an answer to the Magnitsky law, Russian parliament is right now discussing the law that would ban Russian children adoption for the US citizens Many have criticized this law and said that it is somewhat inadequate and disproportional, and were saying that bringing orphan children into politics is not exactly correct You have also spoken against this draft law Why?SL: It is a complex issue For many years we have been appalled by the way some of the Russian kids were treated in the families who adopted them in the United States True, the number of cases which have been made public of maltreatment of the Russian kids is not so arithmetically huge¬† it s nineteen And those who criticize our position say that dozens of thousands of kids have been adopted and absolute majority of them are happy, and I agree with this But I can t accept when people say why do you raise hell about nineteen cases only Any situation in which a Russian kid was humiliated, maltreated, not to mention murdered or raped and those were the cases with some of these nineteen children this must be approached very firmly, I would even say aggressively, to establish the channels which would allow us to influence the situation That s why some time ago we suggested to the Americans to negotiate an agreement on cooperation in the field of adoption And they were not very enthusiastic about it from the very beginning And it is then that we and also the ombudsman for kids, Pavel Astakhov, were seriously thinking about approaching the Russian courts through the appropriate channels and suggesting a freeze on the adoption of the Russian kids by Americans, until and unless we get this agreement Eventually the agreement was signed It entered into force in September this year and it for the first time provides for very important things First, until this agreement was negotiated, the federal authorities in Washington were saying that each state has its own legislation as regards the adoption, so we cannot influence them And so that s it This agreement obliges the federal authorities to take measures to ensure that the states, first, earmark a focal point, which must be addressed, and second, allow for the consular access for the Russian kids which was not allowed before And third, they consider them until the age of sixteen Russian citizens, which was also not the practice This agreement is now in force, and only for two months or three months And we want to make sure that it is functioning properly Unfortunately, the first pilot case, so to say, in Florida, when a boy called Maxim Babayev was part of the issue when his parents were maltreating him and they were deprived of the adoption rights by the American court, and the boy was given temporarily to some foster family ¶ And we are still trying to get access The court ruled against it, but the State Department is now working with the Florida authorities, with the court, explaining that this is an international obligation And this is something that gives us a legal right to insist on getting to the heart of the problem, to the kids themselves So while understanding the position in favor of prohibiting the adoption of the Russian kids by the American families, I still believe that we have to try to keep the agreement itself Because to get out of this agreement would not allow us to attend to those boys and girls who have already been adopted and who live in their adopted families in the United States In other words, the future adoptions might be frozen This is the decision of the parliament, as far as I understand ¬† But I would really ask the lawmakers before they adopt the law in the third reading to keep the agreement Because this would allow us to attend to kids who have already been adopted and who live in their American families Otherwise we would lose this access [RT s note: After the interview with Sergey Lavrov was recorded, the State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament, approved the

"6 Dec, 2012","US Senate approves 'Magnitsky Act', ties it to Cold War era trade law's repeal","The US Senate has passed a new bill normalizing trading relations with the Russian Federation, while at the same time critisizing its former adversary s human rights record In response, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would take similar, reciprocative actions During a meeting with Hillary Clinton in Dublin, I confirmed that we will close entry to Americans who have been guilty of human rights violations, ù Lavrov said The act automatically repeals the Jackson Vanik amendment placing trade restrictions on Russia and establishes permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with Moscow The Jackson Vanik amendment was enacted in 1974 during the Cold War and originally targeted the Soviet Union By enacting PNTR together with the Magnitsky Act, we are replacing Jackson Vanik with legislation that addresses the corruption and accountability issues that Russia confronts today, Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said on the eve of the vote The bill was approved by the House last month After the Senate s 92 4 vote vote it is en route to President Barack Obama for an executive signature The act, while finally normalizing trade relations with Moscow, will allow Washington to deny visas as well as freeze the assets of Russian officials allegedly involved in the death of the Russian lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky The bill also stipulates that future possible violations in the field of human rights would be prosecuted by the same measures Welcoming better trade relations, Russia has condemned the controversial Magnitsky Act incorporated into the bill The country s Foreign Ministry has dubbed the law s approval theatre of absurd ù We do not wish to give up the positive side of the relations we have laboriously built over the last two years, ù a statement on the ministry s website read following the vote But they should understand that the Senate s approval of the provision will have quite a negative impact on our cooperation perspectives The US surely takes sole and utter responsibility for that ùPrevious week, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that approval of the Magnitsky Act would trigger both a symmetrical and asymmetrical reaction from his country We absolutely dislike its link to the trade bill, he said It s inadmissible when one country tries to dictate its will to another Magnitsky case The Magnitsky case began in 2007, when British investment fund Hermitage Capital, one of the biggest foreign investors inside Russia, fell victim to a US$230 million fraud scheme The fund hired corporate lawyer Sergey Magnitsky, whose investigation brought forth names of officials in Russia s Interior Ministry he believed to be involved in the scam Soon after that, the lawyer was arrested on charges of assisting Hermitage Capital to evade tax and was put into a detention facility Spending a year there, Magnitsky suddenly died in November 2009 An inquiry into his death proved he had been denied crucial medical treatment His supporters allege the lawyer had been tortured in an attempt to get him to withdraw his accusations Investigation both into the lawyer s death and tax evasion charges continues Part and Parcel As Obama faces new pressure, Senate has practically ensured the executive s signature by combining both into one document, Aleksey Pushkov, the head of the Duma International Affairs Committee, told RT In order to make it impossible for President Obama to refuse to sign the Magnitsky Act, the lawmakers have presented it to him in the same package as the annulment for the Jackson Vanik amendment, ù Pushkov said This way Obama is being tricked to signing both as he fully understands that approving the Magnitsky Act could potentially damage ties with Russia If the Magnitsky Act and the abolition of the Jackson Vanik amendment were to be handed to the president separately, he could then approve the amendment but not sign the act, Pushkov explained On the one hand, Obama is being pressured by an anti Russian lobby in the US Congress On the other hand, the pressure comes from the American industrial and trade lobby, which is extremely †interested in the abolition of the Jackson Vanik amendment and improve its position in the Russian market, in light of its WTO ascension That s why these two different in meaning documents are being presented as one ù The reason for the Magnitsky Act is Russia s tendency to point out the American government s hypocrisy, believes commentator and journalist Don DeBar The Russian Foreign Ministry should respond to such an obvious insult, where the United States, probably the primary violator of human rights at this point in terms of scale, magnitude and depth, is pointing its finger at anyone, ù DeBar told RT Certainly a person who is having that finger in their face should reply point out, you have no standing to accuse us of anything, and stand up for themselves ù   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/magnitsky-bill-senate-approve-454/
"30 Oct, 2012",‚ÄòThe only US policy towards Syria is to blame Russia‚Äô- Russian MP," Weak, contradictory American policy concerning the Syrian conflict may result in disaster for Syria and Turkey, the head of the Duma International Affairs Committee, Aleksey Pushkov told RT Pushkov warned that Islamic radicals may come to power in Syria and said that Turkey could drag itself into ethnic war In the interview with RT S Anissa Naouai, he explained that only open negotiations, rather than backing a side, will solve the Syrian crisis RT:I d like to begin with diplomacy In the world today it seems even more powerless than ever with situations like conflict in Syria Do you think that there is a political solution, that through words we can have peace there?AP: I think the situation has extremely deteriorated since last spring and it looks more like a bloody deadlock that doesn t offer hope for peaceful solution Yet I think that international community can generate nothing better than Geneva communiqu√© adopted last June, which says that international community has to bring those sides to the negotiation table There is no secret here, there are no magical answers The answer is for both sides, Russia / China on one hand and so called friends of Syria , it is not through backing one of the sides in the conflict that it can be solved I think Russia and China are closer to this understanding than the United States or their European alliance or Saudi Arabia † Unfortunately, their stance until now has been, Assad days are numbered, he has to go , it is not a policy We should try to understand that it is not by arming and financing Syria s armed opposition that a solution can be found The armed opposition has no strength to dislodge President Assad President Assad seems not to have enough strength to crush the military opposition, so here we are really in deadlock So, on both sides we should find people who could start to negotiate RT:What about Turkey? Do you think we ll see any conflict between Syria and Turkey or anywhere else in the region?AP: Turkey can be dragged or drag itself into this conflict But I have a feeling that the leadership of Turkey understands very well that if they go too far in Syria it may become dangerous for Turkey itself You know that an important Kurdish man is living in Syria and in Turkey the Kurds are fighting for a free Kurdistan So Turkish involvement in the war in Syria may have a lot of traps for Turkey, it s not by chance that Turkey has refrained from crossing the border and sending its ground troops to Syria It is easy to go in, it s difficult to get out The story of all the conflicts in that region, Afghanistan, Iraq etc , shows that the decision to go in is taken in two days and it takes years and years to get out So I don t think that the Turkish government is really willing to have an open war with the Syrian government Those two states are basically on the brink of war and this is very dangerous because on the other side of the local map we have Iran and we have all this talk about possible military strike against Iran s nuclear capabilities It is kind of a knot that should be untied bit by bit, now I think it s high time to start to untie the Syrian knot RT: There s a deadlock, a lot of blood, thousands of people have been killed, infrastructure destroyed But [Syria] is not a country like Iraq or Libya that have oil to rebuild itself if we ever see an end to this conflict Who can possibly benefit from this fighting in what obviously seems to be a losing situation for both sides?AP: Syria has some oil but you re quite right it s not the amount which will be sufficient to rebuild the whole country Syria, by the way, whatever can be said about the rule of Assad family was a pretty decent, economically and socially, country in the Arab world I visited Damascus last February and the city produced a very good impression on me It was kind of a European city, it was very open city, open air city, very secular in style It is an Islamic country but somehow the style of living was very modern And you could see women sitting with their husbands in caf√©, nice restaurants Economically it was quite clear that Damascus was one of the points of attraction in this region So it s really a pity that the country that has been enjoying quite an important economic growth, which has now † descended into shambles And who will profit from the destruction of Syria? I think only those who re after establishing a radical Islamist regime in Syria There are some countries in the Arab world and the Muslim world that are financing radical Islamist forces and are quite willing in the case of Syria to support the Sunni radicals against the Shia who are now in power at the expense of the Christians, of the Kurds, of the Druze and other minorities that are living in Syria So in some capitals of this area this conflict is considered through completely different eyes, it s about installation of the Sunni rule in the country which had been ruled by Shia minority for 40 years But it was exactly the fact that this country was ruled by Shia minority that allowed to have that multi ethnic and multi confessional combination in Syria which worked I mean, for 40 years there have been no ethnic conflicts in Syria, there was no ethnic cleansing So my feeling is that what is being done today in Syria is an attempt to crush this multi ethnical and multi confessional peace and to establish one group of people and one religion who would be much higher above the others or even one brand of a religion that would be radical Islam and Sunni radical majority that would lead the country But I think we should see where it leads, look at Saudi Arabia where we have quite an Islamic minded government, let s put it this way, we don t have democracy there RT: And they get along great with the United States Where s the US stand in terms of regime change? They re very open, it s no secret that they want Assad to go And then, they re pushing on Russia and criticizing Russia that it s them and China who are blocking any kind of progress on a solution AP: The United States to my mind are completely mixed up here Actually they are the reason of the large part of all this mess has triumphed so to say in Syria The United States try to prove us that with the help of Qatar, where there s no constitution and the opposition is being crushed, or of Saudi Arabia, where there s no constitution and even the remote notion of what democracy is, they will establish freedom and democracy in Syria And I wonder who can believe this, I wonder whether the American diplomats, do they put two and two together The US position is completely flawed I think basically that the US themselves are at a loss in this situation, they don t know what will happen, they don t know who are the forces that will come to power When Hillary Clinton was asked on the Congress hearings, who are the people the United States support politically in Syria, she said I don t know And also she was asked why actually Mr El Zawahiri, one of the leaders of al Qaeda, says that Assad is their main enemy In a paradoxical twist of history, Hillary Clinton and El Zawahiri find themselves on one side of the fence against President Assad How America reached this unbelievable position, I do not know I think it is very contradictory, very weak, I think the US had no policy towards Syria and the only policy they have is to blame Russia They are very lucky to have Russia because at least they have somebody to blame If Russia was not around the void of American foreign policy on Syria would have completely been clear to everybody RT: Right, let s talk for a moment about the forces that will come to power in the US They are having elections very shortly What does that mean for Russia, does it matter who is going to be in office for the next four years in terms of foreign policy, to expect any changes either way?AP: Well, the Russian President said already a couple of times that we will work with the President who s chosen by the American people So I don t think that Moscow would like to take sides Unlike, by the way, our American friends who always like to take sides and who show that they would like to have this person as a President or that person as President, and the one who is popular in the country, they would not like him to become the President of Russia We have a different approach, but Mr Romney complicated everything Basically, he set the tone of this election to the extent as Russia is concerned and he made us choose almost immediately when he said that he considers Russia to be America s number one geopolitical foe After this the answer from Moscow is evident, who is the President we would like to win As I say, Mr Romney said it all So we definitely would not like to have a President who has some kind of negative attitude about Russia For half a year, or a year, if Mr Romney is elected, it would be a year of farcical, theatrical Cold War, mostly rhetoric, but still it will poison the relationship to a large extent I think the reset declared by Mr Obama, although it was very much criticized on both sides in the United States and in Russia, I think it has produced something And the most important result of that reset is that the tonality has changed because basically the relationship between Moscow and Washington, between the Kremlin and the White House, turned to ashes in the last months of George Bush s second presidency The reset brought a new tone and atmosphere in the Russian American dialogue The relationships between Mr Obama and Mr Medvedev and even between Mr Obama and Mr Putin are decent relationships They have of course their complications and the differences have not gone away on a number of issues But still it s an atmosphere at which we can consider ourselves as partners Partners with disagreement but still partners With Mr Romney we will be forced to consider ourselves as enemies, so it s definitely preferable to have partner you heavily disagree with, than an enemy which would kind of be a clear cut enemy So I think that Russian choice in those American relations is absolutely clear RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/syria-russia-conflict-policy-606/

"5 May, 2012",Medvedev leaves behind legacy of reform,"Dmitry Medvedev s time in the Kremlin may go down in the history books as a period when Russia began to make serious strides in the fight against corruption, and changes in law that introduced colorful diversity into the nation s political life Although Medvedev is widely recognized for declaring war on Russian corruption, his first task as president brought him face to face with a conflict of the bloody sort Just three months into Medvedev s presidency, on the morning of August 8, 2008, Russia awoke to the news that Georgia had launched a large scale military offensive against South Ossetia in a desperate bid to claim the territory The attack caused casualties among civilians and Russian peacekeepers stationed in the capital, Tskhinval What followed next were five days of intense fighting, with Russian forces pushing deep into Georgian territory Eventually, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili agreed to a ceasefire, which Moscow signed on August 16 Ten days later, Medvedev signed a decree officially recognizing the sovereignty of South Ossetia and nearby Abkhazia Although Russia was viciously attacked on the Western media front during the duration of the conflict, an EU independent commission report found that Georgia, not Russia, was really to blame for starting the hostilities Pushing the reset buttonAlthough the South Ossetian conflict placed severe strains on Russia US relations, outgoing President Medvedev and his American counterpart, Barack Obama, nevertheless found the political will to activate the button on their reset ù plans In March 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a mock up reset button to symbolize improved bilateral relations The little red button, however, quickly became the butt of jokes as the word reset was mistranslated into the Russian for overcharge ù Ironically, however, † overcharged ù has come to more accurately describe the state of Russia US relations in light of recent developments But more on that later In April 2010, the reset bore its first fruit in the form of a New START treaty, which limited each side to 1,500 nuclear warheads The only thing that could possibly derail the bilateral bonhomie was if the United States and Russia failed to cooperate on the construction of the US missile defense system in Eastern Europe Unfortunately, that is exactly the course the reset is taking today Missile defense crash and burnLooking back on the New START treaty, it may seem almost sinister that the Obama administration spoke of slashing nuclear warheads at the very same time it was building a missile defense system in Eastern Europe Trading away some nuclear missiles while constructing a massive shield to hide under did not fool anybody, least of all the Medvedev administration As Russian military experts recently warned, the US built system has the potential for making Russia s remaining stockpile totally irrelevant Unless the talks produce some tangible results, Russia will be forced to walk away from New START, possibly prompting another arms race in the process There is even the possibility that Russia will consider the risk of initiating a preemptive strike on the missile defense system Russian General Chief of Staff Nikolay Makarov announced last week at a missile defense conference in Moscow that Russia may be forced into such a position if the situation continues to deteriorate Considering the destabilizing nature of the (American) ABM system, namely the creation of the illusion of inflicting a disarming (nuclear) strike with impunity, a decision on preemptive deployment of assault weapons could be taken when the situation becomes more difficult, ù Makarov said Meanwhile, Medvedev warned the US and NATO on many occasions over the course of his last two years in office that without an agreement on missile defense, the world would face the prospect of another arms race I am not satisfied with the American side s reaction to my proposals and with NATO s reaction in general, ù the Russian leader told reporters at the G 8 Summit in Deauville, France last year Why? Because we are wasting time Even though I spoke about the year 2020 yesterday as a deadline which is the year when the construction of a four stage system of the so called adaptive approach ends Political reformIn an effort to inject more political diversity into Russia s political system, as well as appease the demands from a chorus of critics, Medvedev signed into law a bill to simplify Russia s current stringent requirements for the registration of political parties The Justice Ministry should not be seen as a barrier † as participants in a previous discussion called it † but as a filter to do away with irregularities, Medvedev said during a meeting with some 40 leaders of unregistered parties in Moscow The ministry has in the past refused to register opposition parties, often on technicalities that the political opposition believes unfairly denies them a political voice The bill, which was passed both houses of parliament, reduces the membership requirement for registering a party to 500 people from the present 45,000 It also eliminates the requirement for parties to collect voter signatures in order to participate in elections The outgoing President also signed a much anticipated law on the direct election of governors This law now enters into force and from now on heads of regions in this country will be elected by direct secret voting of all citizens living on the territory of the region, ù Medvedev announced during a meeting with leaders of the State Duma parties Finally, in what could also be described as political reform, Medvedev passed a decree for the creation of a Public Television channel in Russia, which is scheduled to air on January 1, 2013 Of course, the state has influence on everything, but such influence must not be exorbitant, ù Medvedev observed Battling corruption Corruption has become a systemic problem, and we therefore need a systemic response to deal with it, Dmitry Medvedev, May 19, 2008 Although external factors may eventually undo Medvedev s reset efforts with the United States, nothing will be able to take away his sweeping efforts to eliminate corruption in Russia One of Medvedev s first acts as president was the signing of a law obliging officials, including the prime minister, deputy prime ministers and ministers, to report not only their own incomes, but also those of their family members Medvedev did not exclude himself and his family from following the new legislation Medvedev continued his battle against corruption up till the very end of his presidential term In March, he submitted to the State Duma a bill that aims to control civil servants expenditures, telling the parliamentary majority he wanted it discussed and approved as soon as possible I am asking you to pay special attention to this bill so that it is worked through and made effective before being approved, ù the outgoing President told lawmakers Medvedev s new draft law obliges all civil servants to declare not only their incomes, but also large expenditures It requires that state officials report the expenditures of their spouses and children if the expenditures involved acquisitions of land, vehicles or securities Finally, the bill would require that all documents pertaining to the acquisitions were received legally Although Russia still has a long way to go before corruption is a thing of the past and the country conforms to the rule of law ù Nevertheless, Medvedev s strenuous efforts have put the country on the right path Modernization and reformIn addition to fighting corruption, Dmitry Medvedev has shown himself to be a tech savvy politician He embraced the endless capabilities of the internet, reaching out to his constituents via a variety of social media, which includes a personal blog and Twitter account He even instituted a program that allowed him to watch in real time how government bureaucrats were carrying out their orders I want it installed on my own computer, so that I can see at the click of a button, what is happening with the decree, who is responsible for the delay, and what should be done with the culprit, ù he told reporters in October, 2010 Meanwhile, reform initiatives are not relegated to the halls of government The urgent need for police reform was accentuated the January 24, 2011 bombing at Domodedovo International Airport, which killed 36 people and injured 193 The Russian leader slammed public safety issues at a whole host of facilities ù to make his case for broadening police powers to ensure public safety ù Military modernizerFinally, Medvedev paved the way for radically streamlining the Russian military Russia boasts the fourth largest military in the world, with just over 1 million active personnel and 20 million reserve troops Following Medvedev s orders, Makarov said the Russian military will eventually adopt a recruiting structure similar to those of NATO member states, slowly phasing out its conscript based system in favor of recruiting contract troops We will be moving further, towards a contract armed forces, ù the General Chief of Staff said In conclusion, Medvedev s one term presidency, focused as it was on reform and modernization, provided a perfect balancing act to Putin s emphasis on security and stability Now, Putin will pick up where Medvedev left off, hopefully restoring the reset with the United States, as well as forging an agreement with the US and NATO over European missile defense In the absence of such crucial agreements, Russia will be forced to shift gears and look for new allies, predictably in the East The United States and Europe now have an opportunity to meet Russia halfway in order to confront dire global problems, including terrorism and economic stagnation to name a few It would be terribly unfortunate if this opportunity was missed at such a crucial juncture in history Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved

Opposition protests in Moscow thinning (VIDEO),"Far fewer people than expected turned up for a Saturday rally in central Moscow to protest the results of the recent presidential election, which saw Vladimir Putin winning in the first round with 63 6 per cent of the vote As usual, official estimates differed somewhat from the figures provided by activists Police say some 10,000 people gathered in Moscow s center to protest the presidential poll, while the rally leaders have put the count at up to 25,000 Wherever the true number may lie, the protest was projected to attract at least 50,000 people Police had even expressed readiness to halt traffic in Novy Arbat Street if the crowd could no longer fit into the designated area Demonstrators started flocking to the venue at 12:30pm (08:30 GMT) The opposition s full spectrum turned out from the Left Front headed by Sergey Udaltsov and nationalists under empire flags to the communists and street ù independent activists, who made up the core of the December protests Numerous banners read: This is no president, this is no election ù, Khodorkovsky instead of Putin ù, We have seen worse instances, but never so blatant ù The signature of the movement For Fair Elections ù ribbons, scarves and other tokens, all white flickered everywhere The activists believe the presidential poll was rigged with various techniques to ensure Putin s landslide victory In December the same, they believe, was done for the United Russia Party to scoop a majority in the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma Saturday s rally reaffirmed the slogans created in December, transferring them onto the presidential poll: election results should be annulled; election violators should be punished; Russia needs heavy political reform; political detainees should be released from jail We will strive for snap elections to take place: parliamentary in one year s time, presidential in two years, ù says opposition politician Vladimir Ryzhkov Volunteers who observed the presidential election took to the stage to tell the protesters of the violations they had witnessed at the polling stations Ryzhkov says files will be sent to courts in 10 15 day s time Ryzhkov also called for a new protest on May 7 the date when President elect Vladimir Putin will be sworn in Leftist Udaltsov urged a March of Millions before that day The rally wrapped up an hour earlier than it was supposed to Police detained three people, including Udaltsov, over an attempt to stage an unsanctioned march after the rally Explaining the lower turnout, rally leaders say it was a very good result for the third day of a holiday Russia has been marking International Women s Day and many will be spending Sunday at work due to calendar rearrangements But political analysts say the movement is losing its gusto One million to march? No, there will be much fewer demonstrators than what we saw in winter The opposition just does not have enough demands to conduct a protest What can they demand? Annulling election results? Even institutions which are clearly no fans of Mr Putin acknowledge he has won the poll with over 50 per cent of the vote There are no demands, and I can see no one in the opposition who could put forward any demand, ù director of the International Institute for Political Expertise Evgeny Minchenko told Interfax news agency Saturday demo follows the massive opposition rally For Fair Elections ù that took place on Monday in the Russian capital after the Sunday vote Between 14,000 and 20,000 people attended demonstrations at Pushkinskaya Square Police briefly detained some 250 people, including Udaltsov and prominent whistle blowing blogger Aleksey Navalny Despite reports of voting irregularities, the international community has accepted the results of Russia s presidential elections US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Vladimir Putin a clear winner ù   ",https://www.rt.com/news/opposition-russia-novy-arbat-245/
"7 Mar, 2012",Anti-Russian sentiment spikes in US,"Moscow and Washington are at loggerheads as Russia which just overwhelmingly voted Vladimir Putin into the presidential office for the next six years demonstrates it will independently pursue its own foreign policy agenda Tensions between the two countries broke to the surface following a recent UN resolution vote on Syria, which is experiencing a protracted conflict between government and opposition forces The resolution would have demanded that Syrian government forces retreat from conflict zones and essentially lay down their arms Russia, alarmed that the document made no similar demands on opposition forces, vetoed the resolution What followed next was a not so diplomatic tit for tat between American and Russian diplomats US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed Moscow s veto as despicable, ù while the Russian Foreign Ministry responded that Washington s reaction was hysterical ùAlexey Pushkov, head of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, did not betray any secrets when he told reporters on Tuesday that not everyone is happy about Russia s independent foreign policy There are opinions that Russia must become a servicing partner, although this idea is not favored by everyone and everywhere, he added The Duma deputy then mentioned Putin s stand on foreign policy, outlined in a pre election article, in which the president elect warned that foreign actors on the geopolitical stage may be tempted to solve their problems at someone else s cost by means of force The president elect said that Russia should never be in a situation where it may tempt anyone by our weakness ùPutin s warning took on immediate relevancy this week when US Senator John McCain called on fellow colleagues to support a military offensive against Syria The time has come for a new policy, McCain said during remarks on the Senate floor The United States should lead an international effort to protect key population centers in Syria, especially in the north, through air strikes on Assad s forces Although McCain s plan ultimately failed to generate enough support, his comments underscore the tendency on the part of many US politicians and planners to jump headlong into military action † in direct opposition to Russia s stated foreign policy Meanwhile, with US presidential elections scheduled for November, the Republican nominees are wildly playing the Russian card in an effort to win their party s nomination What the world witnessed in Russia yesterday was a mockery of the democratic process, ù Mitt Romney, a leading Republican nominee said following the announcement that Vladimir Putin had won Instead of stating that it congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the presidential elections, as the Obama administration has done, it should have condemned the flagrant manipulation and media restrictions that marred this election ù(It would be fair to add that Russia s presidential elections had hundreds of thousands of observers at polling stations around the country, as well as the use of video cameras, causing many foreign observers to applaud Russia s coordination of the elections) Romney suggested that President Obama s Russia policy is set back ù rather than reset ù, yet provided little clue as to how the Republicans would set forward ù US relations with Russia, especially given the Republicans recent track record on military misadventures The tit for tat over elections has a rather long history between the two countries In December, Putin expressed his irritation with Washington s response to Russia s parliamentary elections, which provoked an outcry from the political opposition, who said the vote was rigged I looked at the first reaction of our US partners, ù Putin said The first thing that the secretary of state [Hillary Clinton] did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers ù She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal, ù Putin continued They heard the signal and with the support of the US State Department began active work ùThe situation between Moscow and Washington hit more turbulence in January with the announcement that Michael McFaul would be the new US ambassador to Russia, making him only the second ambassador to Russia in 30 years who is not a career diplomat It took just hours for McFaul to attract the wrath of his Russian hosts Pushkov said McFaul had attracted criticism by his own actions taken during the first hours on Russian soil, ù referring to a meeting held between the US ambassador and several members of the political opposition shortly after McFaul assumed his duties It is one thing when such a meeting with representative of the opposition is held in a calm atmosphere, and quite another when it happens as the political situation escalates in Russia in the run up to the presidential election, Pushkov said Meanwhile, on Monday night, as the police arrested some protesters who had gathered in the center of Moscow, McFaul posted on Twitter: Troubling to watch arrests of peaceful demonstrators at Pushkin Square Freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are universal values ùThe Russian Foreign Ministry replied in its own Twitter post: Police on Pushkin were several times more humane than what we saw in the breakup of the Occupy Wall Street protests, the tent camps in Europe ùGiven the increasing tension between Moscow and Washington over critical foreign policy questions, which include the US desire to plant a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe, just miles from the Russian border, it will be very fortunate if the tit for tat attacks remain in the form of harmless tweets Robert Bridge, RT

"31 Jan, 2012","Assad must go, no foreign forces in Syria: UNSC draft","The UN draft resolution on Syria reportedly calls for President Assad to hand power over to his deputy in 15 days or face further measures ù It also clarifies that no foreign forces will be deployed to the country The draft, obtained by the Guardian, emphasized any punitive measures would be peaceful It also demands the Syrian government put an end to all human rights violations and attacks against those exercising their rights to freedom of expression ùThe resolution is set to be debated by the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday Further negotiations at the council will take place Wednesday, and a vote is expected on Thursday But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow has no intentions of telling President Assad to step down Russian politics is not to ask someone to resign, ù he told Australia s ABC TV channel Regime change is not our profession, ù the minister added He also rejected out of hand any accusation that Russia unconditionally supports the Syrian leader We are not President Assad s friends or allies, ù he stressed Lavrov made it clear earlier on Tuesday that Assad s continuing tenure as president is not a precondition for a settlement in Syria The resolution fails to take account of the positions of countries like Russia and China, which have presented a united front opposing regime change in Damascus Moscow says the new resolution contains a threat to adopt further measures if Syria does not comply with the terms of the resolution, ù opening the door to a Libya style foreign intervention in the conflict torn Middle Eastern country Lavrov said the UN Security Council would never support a tour de force against Syria If [the Syrian] opposition refuses to sit at a negotiation table with the regime what is the alternative? To bomb the regime? I ve seen that before, ù Lavrov said, I guarantee the Security Council will never approve this ùReportedly, tensions are running so high that the US Secretary of State s spokeswoman has accused Russian FM Sergey Lavrov, who is currently visiting Australia, of being unavailable by phone when Hillary Clinton allegedly called him to discuss the situation Bashar Assad s resignation is a non negotiable precondition for talks on ending the bloody crisis engulfing Syria Head of the opposition Syrian National Council Burhan Ghalioun stressed there could be No negotiations without Assad s exit ùWhile Damascus accepted a Moscow proposal to host informal talks with all parties without any conditions, the Syrian opposition rejected Russia s approach outright Burhan Ghalioun told the Lebanese Daily Star that Moscow has the power to urge Assad to leave, and offered to confirm the status of Russia s naval base in Tartus in return Author and Middle East expert John Bradley told RT the National Council is now a pawn in greater Middle East game: NATO is determined to bring the Assad regime to its knees as a prelude to invading Iran The Syrian opposition is under huge pressure from outside powers who want these talks [between the Assad regime and the opposition] to fail even before they begin most obviously NATO ù The resolution on Syria has been worked out with no Russian participation whatsoever Because Russia s concerns were not taken into account, the resolution is one dimensional, says Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chief of the Russian State Duma Committee for International Affairs This draft resolution is addressed towards just one part of the conflict, namely President Assad and his government, to force them to resign This undermines any perspective for a political solution to the crisis, ù Kosachev said As well as rejecting peace talks, the Syrian opposition has gone so far as to state that President Assad and his family have lost their chance to make a peaceful exit, in an ultimatum which made reference to the brutal killing of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya last year Kosachev believes the Syrian opposition is simply listening to the message coming from abroad, from Washington or Brussels † This message has always been this regime does not have a future, don t talk to them this message is wrong ùThe result of such a stance will be clashes, casualties and blood, Kosachev predicted, But not due to Russia s position, but due to the very unilateral and unfair position taken by the US and their allies ù   ",https://www.rt.com/news/un-resolution-syria-russia-131/
"14 Jan, 2012",Fear and loathing in Central Asia: Will US go to war with Iran?,"As sparks fly dangerously close to the powder keg of US Iranian relations, speculation is rife and rumors are spreading like wildfire Will there be a war? Who wants it? And what will happen to this very lucrative region? Google the words Iran ù, USA ù and war ù and you get over 140 million hits Many believe the possibility of a military conflict between the two is not even a question of if ù, but a question of when ù And there is definitely enough evidence around to lend support to these beliefs Let s break it down Will there be a war? According to Israeli military analysts quoted by Global Research, an independent research and media organization, that possibility is dangerously close ù But let us say analysts, especially military ones, are of the boy scout always be prepared disposition by nature What other evidence is there? Occam s Razor states that the simplest explanation is the most plausible Logic tells us to follow the money and in this case, the cases of weapons shipped out by the US So where are they headed to?In October 2010, the US negotiated a $67 billion deal with Saudi Arabia to supply the latter with bunker buster bombs, F 15 fighter jets, Black Hawk and Apache helicopters, Patriot 2 missiles and warships It is, in simple terms, the largest bilateral weapons deal in US history One month later, in November, the Wall Street Journal revealed that the United States will provide the United Arab Emirates with thousands of advanced bunker buster bombs and other munitions, part of a stepped up US effort to build a regional coalition to counter Iran ùWashington also plans to supply Stinger and other missiles to Oman Kuwait is in for $900 million worth of Patriot missiles And a $53 billion arms deal with Bahrain is still on the agenda delayed only because of pressure from international lawmakers and human rights groups So the United States is increasing military ties with its allies, one might claim And it is true, but all those allies are conveniently located in the Persian Gulf right next to Iran It is not just weapons, either Israel, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman all have US military bases on their territory This month, an additional 15,000 American troops were dispatched to the US base in Kuwait With the US most likely asking NATO in for a piece of the action, alliance members like Turkey are perfectly positioned to lend a helping hand Besides being conveniently close geographically, Ankara has also been holding on to a lot of US nuclear weapons, including a large number of B61 bombs But all this does, effectively, is to highlight the military capabilities of the US in the region Categorically stating all this is being done by the Department of Defense as part of a preparation for war with Iran would be irresponsible † until the Pentagon men say so themselves Oh wait they have been For years In late 2005, then CIA director Porter Goss, who was visiting Ankara, requested that the Turkish prime minister provide political and logistical support for air strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets In 2006, the Israeli prime minister green lit a military strike against Iran Various staged war games always focused on the possibility of military conflict with Iran And all these years later, Secretary of State Clinton s former advisor on Iran still says Obama is more than willing to launch a pre emptive strike Michel Chossudovsky, economist and director of the Centre for Research on Globalization, says there have been specific, detailed military plans for war with Iran since 2003 These war plans go back to the 1990s or even before that If you look at active war plans, you can say May 2003, when the Department of Defense came up with the strategic concept plan CON8022, dubbed Global Strike ù The framework of attacking Iran and the scenarios and the war plans have been going on for the last eight years We have so much evidence of covert operations, of scenarios, of drone attacks, of regime change scenarios And it s not only the United States that are preparing The Iranians have been preparing for this war for years They have the S 300 missile defense system, very extensive ground forces enough to overrun the remaining US forces in Iraq Our estimates are that Iran can mobilize 1 million troops overnight † Preparations, strong allies in the region, huge defense budget for 2012 all the signs point to the Americans getting ready for a potential war But when and how does it start?According to the editor in chief of Russia s National Defense magazine, Igor Korotchenko, anything can trigger the triggers If the US pushes through more sanctions and Iran closes off the Strait of Hormuz in return, that could easily be enough Basically, Washington will use any convenient reason that appears legitimate cause for the international community to attack ùAnd with the upcoming US Israeli war games in the Strait of Hormuz, analysts like Chossudovsky say a convenient reason will be very easy to come by The strait is very narrow There s not a lot of space before Iran s territorial waters begin And they would have to respond to a violation of its territorial waters ù He goes on to speculate that, faced with such a violation, Iran would have no choice but to send an ultimatum to the Fifth Fleet commanders there, which will be ignored for some reason Then, according to international law, a second ultimatum If that is ignored, Iran has no choice but to act leaving America in its preferred position of reacting History does support this notion of provocation being a favored US military tactic Richard Sanders of the Coalition Against the Arms Trade looked at US war history in detail and came out with a rather disturbing conclusion: starting from the Mexican American War in 1846, pretext incidents have been used every time; incidents that were later disproved, or re interpreted by historians, journalists and political committees; incidents that have become a military trademark for one of the world s youngest, but war hungriest nations Sanders statement is echoed by many including www infowars com associate editor Patrick Henningsen Examples he highlights are historical facts that show just how manipulative the US Department of Defense can be This is how the US was able to fake their way into the Vietnam War, via the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Incident Likewise, Israel s slaughter of the USS Liberty naval crew in 1967 was designed as a false flag event, but luckily Russia intervened at the last minute before Israel could sink the American ship ùIt would not be the first time the US has tried to push Iran s buttons As revealed by a senior British officer a few years ago, there were times in Iraq when the US military commanders ordered British troops to prepare a full scale ground offensive against Iranian forces that had crossed the border and grabbed disputed territory If we had attacked the Iranian positions, all hell would have broken loose, the unnamed officer said Unfortunately, all hell breaking loose ù is a scenario that is still not off the table Iran, while not having many allies willing to go to bat for it in the region, can still put up a fight Iran plays a critical role in the Persian Gulf and with its strategic geography not only dominates the Northern Gulf but the shipping lines both inside and outside the Strait of Hormuz Iran s leadership adheres to a no first strike doctrine ù and thus Iran has launched no wars of choice in modern history The Iranian constitution bans the establishment of any foreign military bases in the country, even for peaceful purposes Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran also divided its armed forces into regular and revolutionary components The Iran s Revolutionary Guards is separated from the regular army and has its own Navy, Aerospace and Ground Forces, as well as Special Forces And past experiences have also shown that for the American Armed Forces, a war with Iran, a country that is larger in population than the four countries recently invaded by the US put together, will not be a walk in the park The Pentagon s own war games in 2002 showed that in the event of an armed conflict, the United States would be overwhelmed by Iran in the Persian Gulf As speculated by researcher and sociologist Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, Despite its might and shear strength, geography literally works against US naval power in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf The relative narrowness of the Persian Gulf makes it like a channel, at least in a strategic and military context Figuratively speaking, the aircraft carriers and warships of the US are confined to narrow waters or are closed in within the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf This is where the Iranian military s advanced missile capabilities come into play The Iranian missile and torpedo arsenal would make short work of US naval assets in the waters of the Persian Gulf where US vessels are constricted ùAllies wise, Iran is more or less on its own Syria, its closest ally, is too caught up in the almost year long violence that has been shaking the country, Armenia is a possible one and Lebanon s Hezbollah could shift their allegiance either way The Shanghai Cooperation Council is a regional organization that has a few powerful friends, namely China and Russia, but whether they would want to get involved in an all out military conflict is doubtful A statement made by Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Duma Committee for International Affairs, said that a military operation against Iran could have grave consequences And Russia should make every effort to control emotions, bring negotiations back into the field of political and expert discussion, and not allow any such action against Iran ù This was seconded in a recent comment by Russia s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who said that an attack on Iran will be regarded as a direct threat to Russia Iran is our close neighbor, just south of the Caucasus Should anything happen to Iran, should Iran get drawn into any political or military hardships, this will be a direct threat to our national security, ù stressed Rogozin on January 13 at the Russian mission to NATO As for China, it is showing Tehran some support by refusing to fold under US pressure and halt oil imports from Iran But it has never been one to show its hand before it had to, so the extent of China s potential involvement in the conflict is also open to debate Some analysts, like Patrick Henningsen, believe that should other countries get drawn into the conflict, it could signify the beginning of a new, economical Cold War era Henningsen says that We have the ideal set of conditions for a †New Cold War †to emerge in the early 21st century one where the Western Axis powers of the US, Europe, Israel and GCC countries sit on one side, and with Iran, Syria, Pakistan, China, and perhaps Russia sitting on the opposite side This New Cold War will be more about sub regional dominance in terms of economics natural gas, mineral and trade relationships, as well as petroleum † than it will about the political ideologies that seemed to dominate the previous 20th century Cold War ùAs sparks fly and tensions reach critical points, experts and analysts argue over who will start the war, why they will start the war, how the war will develop, whether it will spill out into World War III and what will happen in the end Opinions are varied, detailed and range from the simplistic and obvious to the complex and conspiratorial And the only one thing they all agree on?

"28 Dec, 2011",‚ÄòRussia and US are in for a very hard year‚Äô,"Russia s political life dominated world headlines in December, with the parliamentary election and its aftermath firmly in the spotlight But what is the country s direction in its international policy going to be like? RT spoke to Aleksey Pushkov, the newly appointed chairman of the State Duma s International Affairs Committee, about prospective changes that might be expected in Russia s foreign policy Speaking of the future shape of the country s foreign policy, Pushkov particularly pointed out that before anything else is should meet the expectations of the Russian population, and, according to the diplomat, his previous career in television gave him a clear image of what these expectations are The parliamentary elections that took place in Russia on December 4 have invoked heavy criticism from abroad over numerous cases of alleged fraud The head of the State Duma s body on international affairs believes that the Russian parliament can simply ignore this reaction The response has already been given by President Medvedev in Brussels He basically stated that the opinion of the European parliament is not important for Russia Russia is not a member of the European Union, ù he told RT This is a consolidated position of the Russian parliament [too] Whatever requirements and requests the opposition parties may have, they would like it to be a domestic procedure The opposition parties in the parliament, even those who insist that there were violations in the Russian elections, do not support the declaration of the European Parliament and the statement which was made by [the US Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton They regard it also as a domestic affair ùThe diplomat also added that all Russian political parties that are presented in the State Duma have recognized the elections legitimate and attended the first session of the parliament Aleksey Pushkov believes that it is time to reset the reset ù The reason is not just [the parliamentary] elections [in Russia] and the American reaction to these elections I think that there is crisis of a reset policy, ù he said A number of contradictions have accumulated since [Hillary Clinton offered to press a reset button to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their meeting in February 2009] And the biggest contradiction is the US ABM [Anti Ballistic Missile] system in Europe ùAleksey Pushkov refers to Dmitry Medvedev s tough statement on this matter, in which the Russian president mentioned a number of countermeasures that Russia may take if American anti missile system is placed in Europe without taking Russia s concerns into account I think that this answer was well thought over and was not just a knee jerk reaction or some kind of impulsive statement, ù he pointed out The diplomat also reminds that Russia has come up with a plan which could provide for a compromise between the two sides on this complicated issue, but this plan has been rejected by NATO Recently, we have heard from the [US] State Department that the United States would not allow Russia to have a veto power over US plans of ABM deployment in Europe, that Russia will not be able to change the plan itself and the schedule Basically, this was a no to Medvedev s offer to resume negotiations, ù was his conclusion Speaking of the forthcoming presidential elections of 2012 in the United States and Russia, Aleksey Pushkov noted that these elections are more likely to have a negative effect on bilateral relations [Presidential elections] always have impact on bilateral relations, especially such complicated relations as the relations between Russia and the United States And my feeling is that these elections will not be an exception, and the effect will be negative, ù he said [Republicans] are accusing Obama of being too soft on Russia What kind of reset can we have in these conditions? The administration will have to be sensitive to these attacks, they cannot just, you know, pay no attention, for these are election times, ù Pushkov explained So I think we are in for a very hard year in Russia US relations I think that in Russia too, there is a lot of disappointment with the reset ù All this state of reset between Moscow and Washington is extremely fragile So I m not very optimistic about the prospects of the reset in the electoral year both in the United States and Russia, ù the chairman of the International Affairs Committee concluded   ",https://www.rt.com/news/russia-us-reset-pushkov-797/

Interior Ministry reported around 25,000 people gathered at the scene † However opposition leaders claim up to 40,000 on the square Before the rally police have blocked access to the squares adjacent to the Kremlin and have restricted entry to Red Square Security in the capital has been stepped up with police trucks and Interior Ministry troops surrounding the scene Moscow police say security will be tightened in the city until nightfall to prevent possible incidents People who came out to protest in central Moscow today were of all ages and backgrounds, reports Itar Tass news agency There were young people, the middle aged and pensioners Many came with white ribbons, balloons and flowers Supporters of different parties and movements were present on Bolotnaya Square Banners belonging to the liberal Yabloko party, the Communists, the Solidarity ù movement and the Russian Federation of Car Owners could be seen The event has passed off peacefully, with no arrests made However, fire torches have been lit among the nationalist contingent at the rally One has been thrown at the crowd Protesters have booed the provocation and handed over some of the perpetrators to the police Moscow officials had previously provided protestors with a permit for a 300 strong meeting on Revolution Square, not far from the Kremlin s walls But as tens of thousands signed up for the event on social networks, the rally s organizers agreed to the city s suggestion that the rally be staged on Bolotnaya Square, which can hold a larger crowd † And is only about 2 kilometers away from the initial location The new venue was offered by Moscow authorities out of security considerations There were announcements in the Moscow Metro, and police throughout the city center were informing citizens about the change of venue At least five sizeable groups were redirected from Revolution Square to Bolotnaya They were escorted by police with police helicopter monitoring the situation from the air The opposition demanded the annulment of the election results and the resignation of the Central Election Commission chairman It also called on authorities to investigate violations and falsifications

Russia, noting that he was very much surprised ù by Hillary Clinton s recent comments They were very much out of the framework drafted in a preliminary conclusion by the parliamentary assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, issued the day after the elections ùKosachev says the Secretary of State s conclusions are not fair, adding that in his view, her comments were not free of the United States political interests, ù as the US competes with Russia on many important issues It is quite obvious that if and when you can create addition problems for your interlocutor, Kosachev told RT, then it may be easier to reach your own goals So, for me the statement by Hillary Clinton, some other statements by the EU, and by NATO and other high representatives in the West are just a part of the game ùAccording to the Duma official, this is not about democracy in Russia, nor is it about elections the most important thing, he says, is making Russia a little bit weaker in order to make

"8 Dec, 2011",Have Clinton‚Äôs election barbs put an end to the Reset?,"American interference in Russia s internal affairs risks poisoning relations again Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin is confident that public criticism of the Duma poll by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signal the end of the Reset In the article below, Panarin explains his view Several years ago, it was Mrs Clinton who first publicly declared the beginning of the Reset in Russian American relations Now, though, in her speech at an OSCE foreign ministers meeting in Vilnius, she has effectively heralded the end of the Reset phase between the former Cold War enemies On December 6, the US Secretary of State urged the Russian authorities to carry out a full investigation of all credible reports of electoral fraud and manipulation ù Note that this was Hillary Clinton s second statement relating to Russia s parliamentary elections At an international conference on Afghanistan in Bonn, she expressed concern regarding reports of electoral fraud at polling stations during Russia s parliamentary poll Thus, we heard criticisms of Russia coming from Mrs Clinton for two days running, something rarely seen in international relations The person in charge of America s international politics should pay attention to the fact that the USA is the only OSCE member state where presidential elections are not direct This is a gross violation of international election norms Even apart from that, America has plenty of election issues For example, take the fact that huge numbers of Americans residing abroad cast their votes by mail Did you know that envelopes from over a million American voters come in AFTER the voting results have been announced? That means those votes aren t taken into account at all At the same time, America often tries to teach democracy to other states, right down to interfering in their internal affairs The Americans themselves make no secret of the fact that they finance various non government organizations in Russia As State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a press conference, such groups received over $9 million from the US authorities before the Duma elections alone A question is bound to arise, though † what about the Reset? Imagine Russia supplying, for example, 10,000 warm tents for American protesters in Oakland, Los Angeles, New York, and other cities; all free of charge, simply to aid the democratic process in the USA What would Mrs Clinton s reaction be? As for Mr McCain s reaction, it is hard to imagine at all So why does the Reset have to be a one sided affair? At the same time, the parliamentary elections in Russia have shown, of course, the weakness of Russia s opposition, which is rather good at spending its Western sponsors copious budgets This poor return on investments, perhaps, is the factor that frustrates Mrs Clinton most The latest parliamentary elections in Russia have shown clearly that Russia s political scene lacks a unified opposition force that could play a meaningful part in the elections All efforts by the USA to form a powerful, unengaged opposition have been in vain All attempts by the opposition, backed organizationally and financially by a number of Western states (the USA and the UK), to rock ù the internal situation in Russia, have failed In many respects, this is due to the careful and consistent work of the ruling duo of Putin and Medvedev, who are more interested in political stability than anybody else †At the same time, a conclusion can be drawn that political stability in Russia frustrates immensely a whole range of influential political figures in the USA Their views are publicly expressed by Mrs Clinton, which is another proof of the end of the Reset Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/parliamentary-elections-russia-panarin-223/

"30 Sep, 2011",Putin still most popular politician in Russia - Medvedev,"In an interview with the heads of three major Russian television channels, President Medvedev explained why he chose not to Run for presidency in 2012 and what it takes to bring more changes to Russia s politics Below is the full text of President Dmitry Medvedev s interview with First Channel Television, Russia Channel and NTV Channel on September 30, 2011 KONSTANTIN ERNST: Mr President, last week, a major and long awaited event happened in politics: at the United Russia convention, you suggested that Vladimir Putin should run for president Many are wondering what your motives were Your approval rating is high, and you are a young, energetic politician with a good reputation What was the primary motive behind your decision? Usually, presidents seek re election You are a politician, and politicians are ambitious people What was your ambition in making this decision?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: My biggest ambition is to be useful to my country and my people This may sound a bit pretentious but it s true Unless you have this ambition, you shouldn t go into politics You should focus on something else instead of politics or government service As for my reasons, on the one hand they are obvious; on the other hand, there are always many questions about them I d like to stress that both for me and Vladimir Putin the top priority is to be of use to our homeland, our nation We both belong to the same political force Both Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev were nominated for the presidency first him, then me, under the current model of power by the United Russia party Vladimir Putin was No 1 on the United Russia slate, and yours truly is this time So we really represent the same political force We belong to the same political force and our views are very close Of course, we may be different on a personal level; each of us has his own habits But our views are very close on most strategic issues in fact, on all the strategic issues of how our country should develop and on other issues as well So, sharing the same views, should we compete against each other? Should we argue and fight? I have read a few pieces by political analysts that basically say, Why don t they go into the political arena and vow to fight each to the end? Why don t they have an open rivalry? ùBut that s not the way it happens anywhere in the world People who represent the same political force always decide between themselves who will run for this or that office In some countries, they use primaries for this purpose We don t have much experience with primaries in Russia, although we have seen positive examples In some countries, the decision is made simply by at a party convention or by the leaders themselves Can you imagine Barack Obama competing with Hillary Clinton? You may remember that they both sought nomination That would be impossible They both belong to the Democratic Party, and their decision was based on who could get better results And this was also how we made our decision Of course, it s nice to know that people trust me as president and that my approval rating is quite high under current circumstances But I also know that Prime Minister Putin undoubtedly remains the most popular politician in our country at this point and his rating is even higher Somehow, people tend to forget about that Those may be just practical considerations, but every politician should pay close attention to them, if he really wants to be useful to his country and not just fight against other people In fact, this is exactly what people often want us to do They want us to become enemies and enter an open confrontation on the political arena At least that s the kind of recommendation I hear from the opposition and from some political analysts Let me tell you: this is not going to happen What we are after is a political result We want to win the elections, both the parliamentary election in December and the presidential election in March, not just to satisfy our ambitions Every responsible person should have an ambition to serve their country I strongly believe that OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Speaking of your plans for 2012, you ve had quite a few interviews in recent months where you hinted that you did not rule out the possibility of running for office Why was that? Did you genuinely feel this way at the time? Or you simply didn t want to break the news of the decision you made together with Putin, ahead of time?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Let me tell you and, of course, all our people absolutely frankly: we are dealing with practical politics and practical governance Everything may change in this life It s true we have long had an understanding on how to configure the power, should our people show us trust in 2011 and 2012 It s true, and we said so at the party convention But at the same time life could have made unexpected and paradoxical changes to our plans What if the preferences of the voters change, for some reason? I must take this into account Vladimir Putin and myself are holding two top posts, that of president and prime minister, and we must basically be a back up for each other, because we are ordinary people, after all Therefore, when I said I did not rule out such a possibility, naturally, I was not cheating anyone Life could have taken an unexpected turn But we did have a certain understanding between us In fact, I believe that in any situation, even in the future, should we succeed in implementing our current plans, we should always think about the future and what we should do in various difficult situations that we can hardly foresee or predict in their totality This is why I said what I said VLADIMIR KULISTIKOV:Mr President, now a few words about the United Russia convention It astounded me, first, by the huge number of participants DMITRY MEDVEDEV: We are learning from our foreign colleagues VLADIMIR KULISTIKOV:Exactly! It looked foreign to me with all the cameras, banners and flags At the same time, the atmosphere was very warm, friendly and, I would even say, intimate At round table meetings, participants spoke about things that were close to their hearts Now and then, they would forget what to say, look in their papers and go on even more eloquently Then, to crown it all, two very respected figures appeared and said they had agreed on how to distribute two top jobs in the government between them Many people watched this and said, It has all been decided already Why spend money on the elections? What s the point of elections if everything has been decided? ùDMITRY MEDVEDEV: First of all, I agree that the atmosphere at the convention was very warm I have attended many different events, and I assure you that you cannot fake it no matter what some people say, no matter how much this convention may remind them of the [Communist Party] congresses of the past The atmosphere of trust was indeed there you re right about that Now, about those ideas you mentioned I consider them absolutely irresponsible, misleading and even provocative What are you talking about? The election campaign has just started Let s ask ourselves a simple question: what if our people reject us both Medvedev and Putin? What will happen to these decisions by the convention? These decisions are merely the party s recommendation to vote for those people, that s all The choice is made by the people, and these are not mere words; it s absolutely true Any politician and any political force may lose an election We have seen this happen time and again, both in our country and abroad Anything can happen What do you mean, everything has been determined ù?Let s imagine for a second that we have reached an agreement with Gennady Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Sergey Mironov and others that they will not run, whereas we, the big time politicians, ù will That would have really been an imitation But they will! They will take part in the elections, both in December and March They will take part in the State Duma election, and they also have presidential ambitions Let the people decide who they should vote for, whose popularity is greater Only our people can make a final decision by voting for a candidate or a political force or turning them down This is what democracy is about KONSTANTIN ERNST:Mr President, you are the only person at the top of the United Russia federal list How much are you personally going to be involved in campaigning? Who else, or what else, will United Russia use for its campaign? And do you expect tough competition during this campaign?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Indeed, I am at the top of the United Russia list The party asked me to do this, and it s a serious choice for me First of all, it was United Russia that nominated me for the presidency Second, I have been working together with United Russia all these years, with the party supporting the president s initiatives Therefore, United Russia is definitely closer to me out of all the political forces It is a great responsibility for me as president that United Russia made this decision I expect the party to win, and I expect our people to make their choice at the elections At the same time, let me remind you that I am still president I have a lot of responsibilities, both domestically and internationally Thus, naturally, I am not going to take a vacation, and I will not occupy myself with any special campaign activities People should evaluate the president and the government based on their work If they see that things are going well, they will vote correspondingly If they see that the leadership is doing something wrong, they will vote against it This is what democracy is about Consequently, I will be performing my duties At the same time, I am sure that there will be tough competition Competition will be tough but, hopefully, proper and we have the necessary legal mechanisms to ensure that OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Mr President, I think my next question is of great interest to many political ethnographers DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Ethnographers?OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Yes, ethnographers There have been many speculations about this Why did you announce your decision now, not after the State Duma election? We all know our country well We all know how our bureaucrats always become stupefied when they learn about such decisions Don t you think that our entire administrative system, our entire bureaucracy, may freeze for a period of time?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: That would be very bad, because everybody should work like clockwork until the presidential term expires and the government resigns At the same time, it s true that such a decision should be announced at an appropriate time, otherwise bureaucrats may go crazy That happens, too I think we made this announcement not too early and not too late At the same time, we need to make sure that everybody is doing their job diligently, responsibly, occupying themselves with administrative work rather than political intrigues This applies to both the president of the Russian Federation, the cabinet and all the other government agencies VLADIMIR KULISTIKOV:Still, Mr President, many people were bored They felt like everything has been decided But they were only bored for a few hours, until Aleksey Kudrin was sacked His resignation was totally unexpected Again, people say different things about this resignation Some say he was out of line, and there obviously was an issue of discipline At the same time, some say it was a subtle political move to sack a stingy finance minister who refused to give money to agricultural producers, milkmen, servicemen, etc , and appoint a new minister who would not be so stingy before the elections and would give everybody what they ask for So how much of Kudrin s resignation was a matter of discipline and how much of it was his differences with you? Did you really have serious differences with the finance minister?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Actually, I have made a public statement about this and made all the necessary comments In fact, I did it practically live on air But I don t mind saying it again From the legal perspective and that s the only perspective from which we can talk about those differences all the decisions on government spending, including defense spending, the wages for military personnel, etc , have been made by the government and carry the signatures of all the key officials All those decisions carry the signature of the former finance minister I think you should be forthcoming in such a situation: either you don t agree with these expenditures because for some reason you think they are wrong, but then it s obvious what you should do or if you approve the expenditures, you don t make any comments about it So, the situation with Mr Kudrin is a matter of discipline in government service That s all there is to it We don t have a coalition government in Russia We are a presidential republic, not a parliamentary one Our government is the president s government It implements the president s policies If you don t agree, you should step down That s the only way it can be It s a tough rule, but I m very strong about it and I will insist on it in the future And I am sure that whoever is the head of our state in the future, they will follow the same principles As for Mr Kudrin, it seems to me that perhaps he stayed a bit too long in this job and was bored In fact, he came to see me in February or March and said he was aware that it made no sense for him to work in the future government because he had been finance minister for a very long time (Naturally, he knew nothing about our understanding with Mr Putin and the recommendations we were going to give at the convention ) Thus, he did not have any illusions That s why his remarks amazed me Anyway, the decision has been made As for Aleksey Kudrin s future, he is a good professional with a lot of experience, so he will find a good job and a way to be useful to the state KONSTANTIN ERNST: Mr President, many people, both in Russia and abroad, consider you an advocate of liberalism However, recent events seem to indicate that liberals in Russia are somewhat disorganized, especially after the recent situation with Mikhail Prokhorov What happened to the Right Cause party, in your opinion, and is it possible to implement the Right Cause idea in Russia?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Personally, I think that, for a long time, Right Cause has been suffering from a lack of responsible leaders After all, it is the leaders who help their parties achieve results And the Right Cause has had a streak of bad luck with leaders Of course, recent events weakened the party I d like to remind you that Dmitry Medvedev is at the top of another party s list, so I am not going to comment on the situation in Right Cause and their problems There is only one thing I can say and this is also our party s view¬† because, like I said at the party convention, our party is magnanimous Our parliament should reflect the electoral preferences of all Russian people left wing, center, right wing, conservative, democratic, etc In other words, it should include all those who can influence people, all those for whom people vote, or would like to vote A parliament is much more legitimate if it includes all those forces That is my answer to your question VLADIMIR KULISTIKOV: Speaking of society, Mr President, many believe the social base for a right wing liberal party in Russia is still not sufficient, due to the lack of a fully developed proprietary class, or a middle class, whatever you call it But where that basis is definitely sufficient is the Internet And I have to tell you, although you have probably noticed it yourself, that things such as the situation with Mikhail Prokhorov, which Mr Ernst mentioned, or Aleksey Kudrin s dismissal, or the United Russia convention all of that didn t go down well with the Russian blogosphere As an active Internet user, do you feel any pressure from the blogosphere? Have you replied to any of the comments posted to your account lately? Or would you like to reply to them right now?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: You know, if I literally felt the pressure, it would be very difficult for me to work as president At the same time, you are right to say that I pay a lot of attention to the Internet Now, to be precise, there have been different reactions to the United Russia convention, the difficult situation in Right Cause and the recent resignations There are people who start saying, That s terrible, democracy is over! ù And then there are people who cheer and say, Finally! You should be even tougher on them ù The blogosphere reflects all the different attitudes and views that form public opinion It s a different matter that, for a number of natural reasons, the Internet has a larger share of younger users as compared to older people Hence, what you see there is not an entirely accurate picture of public opinion I think the fact that the Internet, the blogosphere, the social networks react to politics is a good thing It means there is vivid feedback to what we are doing Reactions vary, but this difference of opinions is one of the elements of direct democracy, the modern, 21st century democracy Of course, Internet polls and their results are not legally binding for governments Nor do they accurately reflect public opinion, because, as I would like to stress once again, you won t find a lot of right wingers hanging out on the websites of left wing parties, and vice versa: people who share Communist ideas would hardly be regular readers of LiveJournal, for one, where the audience is more liberal minded, more right leaning It s great that there are all these different opinions And I believe that the authorities should react to what s going on in the blogosphere without giving in to pressure, of course The government should be up to date, and it should pay attention to opinions expressed, including those expressed via the Internet It s a must for any politician of any level in the world of today OLEG DOBRODEYEV: To follow up on Mr Kulistikov s question, Mr President, have you noticed one alarming trend with our society lately; namely that the public has been turning its back on politics, turning its back on the government? There is a problem with upward social mobility, and the faces on TV do not change VLADIMIR KULISTIKOV:Ours, for example OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Yes, including ours DMITRY MEDVEDEV: Yours, sure Not ours OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Already for a decade now And no matter how successful some individual companies or managers could be, there is a distinct feeling that some people have been in their jobs for too long Of course, I would not like us to follow the advice of Ivan the Terrible who used to take personnel decisions ù quite frequently Still, what needs to be done for new strong individuals to appear in this country; because, obviously, such a demand does exist?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: First, let me say a few words about the weariness I ve been thinking about it quite a lot, maybe because I am one of those who, due to their official status, are often shown on TV and spoken about in other media Mr Dobrodeyev, you must remember how our people, myself included, perhaps you, too, although you re a long time media professional, used to watch news bulletins in the early 1990s? We were glued to the screens, particularly when, say, the sessions of the Congress of People s Deputies were being held Hours of political broadcasting overshadowed everything any movies or TV series I think it s a clear sign of poor living standards The better our life is, the less attention people will pay to that, because they are more or less happy with their life However, they should not become indifferent They should go to the polls and vote for this or that political force This is the constitutional duty, if you will, of every citizen who is not indifferent to the destiny of their own country, their homeland So talking of people being weary and indifferent, let me stress once again I don t have such an impression Sometimes they say our life has degenerated into uninterrupted entertainment; and that television is only entertaining But what are the other options? 1993 style television? To be honest, I would not want it Maybe there are some who want it after all, our country is a democracy in this respect Now, what concerns the need for the new faces you were talking about I am fully with you on this It is not only about stagnation stagnation is always dangerous and may lead to very bad consequences What s crucial is that those in power should eventually muster up enough strength to leave it to somebody else Such changes should not happen abruptly, with everyone resigning at once, waving their hands in farewell, with Vladimir Putin and me saying Good bye! We re off! ù There must be continuity We must know who succeeds us at the helm of the state However, there must be a renewal, and a very serious one I have been trying to make sure that this renewal is continuous In the past three years, as a result of my decisions, nearly a half of regional governors have been replaced And those who left were not all of a retirement age Those were very different people Some had been appointed only a few years, even several months, before the decision that they should resign This should be going on everywhere among regional governors, in the police, in municipalities and, of course, at the level of federal government A government doesn t like shake ups I often receive messages from citizens with a demand like Fire this minister immediately! Shame on you! There s been a disaster but he is still in office! ù We must realize that not everything goes wrong because of a minister We do have quite a difficult situation in the industrial sector and our economy in general But there must be new faces in the government Therefore, if it happens that our nation, the citizens of Russia entrust the United Russia Party to form the government, I mean if they vote for United Russia, if our citizens vote for our presidential candidate, and if I become in charge of forming a new government it will be a totally reshaped government, a government that will feature fresh faces This is what I believe to be of paramount importance OLEG DOBRODEYEV:Thank you for your reply KONSTANTIN ERNST:Mr Medvedev, how did your family respond to the latest events?DMITRY MEDVEDEV: You know, my family is used to all kinds of things, but they feel that if everything we are talking about comes true, if the elections take place in just that way and we get the mandate to run the country and the government, they will hardly be able to see me more often than they do now And although it s not something they are happy about, they continue to help me in every way KONSTANTIN ERNST: Mr Medvedev, thank you for this interview And although we have robbed some of the political commentators of the chance to put forward their theories, the potential voters seem to have been given answers to all the questions that were in the air DMITRY MEDVEDEV: I believe this is the most important mission of television KONSTANTIN ERNST:Thank you!DMITRY MEDVEDEV:Thank you!

"26 Jul, 2011",US-Russia visa row heats up,"The Obama administration has imposed a travel ban on 60 Russian nationals, which Washington alleges are connected to the prison death of lawyer Sergey Magnitsky As uncertainties linger over the Obama administration s commitment to a true reset ù in bilateral relations with Russia, the visa blacklist against dozens of Russian citizens will certainly dirty the diplomatic waters Washington formally announced plans for its visa blacklist, as well as a move to freeze assets belonging to certain individuals Secretary [Hillary Rodham] Clinton has taken steps to ban individuals associated with the wrongful death of Sergey Magnitsky from traveling to the United States, ù the Senate document said Senior Russian government officials have warned us that they will respond if this [Senate] legislation passes, ù the document reads Their argument is that we cannot expect them to be our partner in supporting sanctions against countries like Iran, North Korea, and Libya, and sanction them at the same time Russian officials have warned that other areas of bilateral cooperation, including on military transit flights to Afghanistan, could suffer from the passage of this legislation Of course, Russia won t leave without attention such unfriendly acts and will take appropriate measures to protect the sovereignty of the country and its citizens against the unlawful acts of foreign states, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a terse statement on Wednesday † The head of the Russian Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov on Tuesday said that the so called Magnitsky case was primarily Russia s internal affair, and warned that the US black list could have undesired consequences The idea of fighting crime and corruption in Russia is primarily our concern, Fedotov said in an interview with the Interfax news agency For us, it is crucial that all those who are really responsible end up on the Magnitsky list at the Russian, and not the U S border † We are doing everything we can to make sure that the people from this list are eventually barred not only from traveling to America, but also from leaving the country in any manner They should also stand trial, ù Fedotov went on to say † But the Russian HR official said that U S blacklists could prompt retaliatory measures from Russia We understand the noble goals But one also needs to see the potentially unpleasant consequences † This step can generate retaliatory visa restrictions on the part of Russia, ù Fedotov said When a country establishes visa restrictions against another † it is, of course, its sovereign right, but it is thus provoking the other side to set symmetrical restrictions † This appears to me to be extremely counter productive Russia stated very openly and clearly that it is looking to have all visa restrictions lifted, the official said Meanwhile, Moscow was warned against outside pressure being exerted in the case of the 37 year old lawyer who died while in pretrial detention †Investigators alleged that Sergey Magnitsky had conspired with William Browder, who has reportedly been banned from entering Russia, to set up dummy front firms to illegally buy and sell shares in Russian energy giant Gazprom In November 2009, Magnitsky died in prison following complications from an apparent case of pancreatitis This month, the authorities announced prison doctors would be prosecuted for neglecting to provide the appropriate medical care for Magnitsky while he was being detained The head of the Federal Penitentiary Service said last year that the service was partially responsible for the death of the lawyer Following Magnitsky s death, President Dmitry Medvedev put a law on the fast track that allows individuals suspected of white collar crimes, ù as they are referred to in the West, to be released on bail as determined by the courts Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the death a tragedy Meanwhile, the Russian State Duma, or lower house, has been considering a bill that would target US officials with similar sanctions, referring to the extradition of Russian citizens from third party countries In 2010, alleged arms dealer Viktor Bout, a Russian citizen, was extradited to the United States following a lengthy legal battle in Thailand Bout, who has been the inspiration for at least one Hollywood film, now faces an uphill struggle to prove his innocence in the US court system Moscow expected to deliver harsh response At least one lawmaker, Leonid Slutsky, first deputy head of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, says Russia s response to the sanctions imposed by the US State Department must be tough Of course, our response must be tough and harsh, Slutsky told Interfax on Wednesday,commenting on reports that the US State Department has obtained the right to refuse US entry visas to the Russian officials it believes to be responsible for the death of Sergey Magnitsky while in detention Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Department is required to deny visas to individuals involved in human rights violations, such as torture and extra judicial killings, aState Department official told Interfax Certainly, the Russian diplomatic mission will give its tough assessment to this decision, when we receive its formal confirmation, ù Slutsky said It could happen as early as today Slutsky said the Russian diplomatic community understood that the move by the US is a provocation, ù that unfortunately finds support among high governmental circles in the West, and primarily in the US proper We must not yield to provocations, ù he stressed, while saying that Russia must give the toughest possible, but measured response The First Deputy Head of the Duma Committee for International Affairs then mentioned the Russian US reset, put into motion by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his American counterpart, Barack Obama, which could be jeopardized by Washington s gamble Such actions by the U S State Department, if formally proved, conflict with the reset process in the U S Russian relations, he said At the same time, Slutsky noted that cooperation between Russia and the US is growing, and as damaging as the American actions may be, would probably not succeed at reversing current tendencies Of course, this reset is haphazard, but it is still proceeding, and as the chairman of the Russian peace foundation I can confirm: the constructive cooperation between the two countries civil societies is growing, Slutsky acknowledged He then warned of the dangers of allowing certain politicians to disrupt this process At times, even less significant events led to all sorts of cold and hot wars Under no circumstancesshould we allow a disruption of the reset in the relations between our countries, Slutsky said It is vital that we temper our words and actions so as not to wreck the reset process, thus taking our countries back to the threshold of the Cold War he continued Robert Bridge, RT Read related Vyacheslav Nikonov s column here

"20 Mar, 2011",Obama tarnishes Nobel Peace Prize with ‚Äúindiscriminate‚Äù military action in Libya,"Moscow harshly condemns an international military operation against forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, while Washington downplays its role in the hostilities It has taken US President Barack Obama just over one year and less than that if we consider that he earlier agreed to keep open the Guantanamo Bay detention facility † to damage his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in Oslo, Norway in October 2009 On Saturday, US warships unleashed a massive sea based missile salvo against targets inside of Libya, where Col Muammar Gaddafi has been engaged in a desperate showdown against anti government forces The battle is largely centered on the city of Benghazi, where oppositional forces have announced an interim Libyan government ù US warships and submarines fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Libyan territory to disable air defense systems, allowing French and British fighter jets to more easily enforce a no fly zone The attack on Libya marks the third Muslim country that the United States is now engaged in military operations with So much for sitting down and talking with enemies, as Obama promised to do during his political campaign for the US presidency It should be no surprise that Washington is going out of its way to disassociate itself from the Libyan military campaign, or at least the leadership part of it We did not lead this, ù Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told a gaggle of reporters in Paris over the weekend We did not engage in unilateral actions in any way, but we strongly support the international community taking action against governments and leaders who behave as Gaddafi is unfortunately doing ù †Observers say Washington s reluctance to advertize its hefty contribution in the military operation suggests that the Obama administration, already under attack inside of its own party for towing the Bush line, ù is an attempt to deflect hostility from the Muslim world, not to mention Main Street, U S A , which certainly cannot afford to foot the bill for yet another overseas adventure They [the Obama administration] really want this to be a short, jolly operation, ù remarked a senior British defense analyst, who asked not to be identified due to his position But all the bets are off on this one Nobody is quite sure what the allied forces will be able to accomplish [in Libya] over the long haul ùIncidentally, Saturday s attack also marked the eighth anniversary of the start of the Iraq War, begun by Obama s predecessor, George W Bush Russian officials have slammed the US missile attack, while calling on the international coalition to stop the indiscriminate use of force ù it says has killed civilians Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said the air strikes exceed the mandate of the UN Security Council resolution, which approved a no fly zone and authorized all necessary measures to protect civilians We are emphatically urging the coalition states to stop indiscriminate use of force, Lukashevich told reporters, according to Interfax We are firmly convinced that the mandate deriving from Resolution 1973 of the UN Security Council, which was adopted as a rather controversial step, cannot be used for attaining goals going clearly beyond its provisions, spelling out measures solely intended to protect civilians, he said As Operation Odyssey Dawn ù kicked off on Saturday, missile strikes delivered on Libya also hit non military facilities in the capital of Tripoli, as well as in Tarhuna, Maamur and Jmeil, Lukashevich said, before providing a grim picture of the attack s collateral damage As a result [of the missile strikes], 48 civilians have been killed and over 150 wounded, ù Lukashevich revealed A medical center has been partially destroyed and roads and bridges have been damaged ùRussia announced Sunday that it was evacuating some of its diplomatic staff and other citizens from Tripoli Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic Party leader and State Duma Vice Speaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky has described the coalition forces military operation

"5 Feb, 2011",Russia and US get STARTed,"The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between Russia and the US has fully come into force after Russia s Foreign Minister and the US Secretary of State exchanged ratified and signed documents Following the ceremony, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that the New START treaty has taken effect in the form it was signed by the presidents of the two countries Even though the two sides had made so called special statements or recommendations, they will not affect the actual implementation of the deal The original text remains untouched Russia and the US eventually manifested their responsibility for security in the world and their readiness to continue moving towards stability, Sergey Lavrov said We have many plans and we will try to implement all of them † I would like to underline that the START treaty [is in] the national interests of both the Russian and American people, ù he added It favors nuclear non proliferation and disarmament ùHillary Clinton said that in the course of 45 days, Russia and the United States are due to exchange complete information about their nuclear arsenals † She added that within 60 days the sides are due to resume mutual inspections Clinton observed that the countries have managed to attain visible progress in the reset ù process † † Two years ago we all laughed about the translation of the ceremonial reset button that I gave to the foreign minister in Geneva, but when it came to the translation that mattered most, our two countries, led by our two presidents, turned words into action to reach a milestone in our strategic partnership, ù she said Sergey Lavrov and Hillary Clinton met on the sidelines of the international 47th Munich Security Conference which they were both attending The documents they exchanged were earlier ratified by the parliaments of both countries after heated debate The US Senate backed the treaty in December 2010 Before ratification, American legislators amended the treaty, securing Washington s right to modernize its remaining nuclear arsenal Another statement stipulated that the treaty should not obstruct US defense plans in Europe Before giving their approval to the START treaty, the Russian State Duma also made several amendments to the document One of them suggests that Moscow can back out of the treaty if it feels that US missile defense plans in Europe pose a threat to Russia s national security The new treaty will obligate the two countries to cut their atomic arsenals by a third and will regulate military nuclear relations between Russia and the US for the next ten years, with a possible five year extension option It was originally signed by presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama on April 8, 2010 in Prague Nuclear disarmament campaigner Kate Hudson said that the New START treaty is a very important factor in the global trend away from nuclear weapons The fact that the two biggest nuclear powers are engaged in a disarmament process must surely encourage other countries not to go down that route themselves, not to go down the nuclear proliferation routes, ù she said I think as an indication of the way the international community is moving on nuclear weapons, this is very significant indeed and of course, the way is open for the United States and Russia to pursue further bilateral reductions, ù Hudson added Kommersant newspaper political analyst Sergey Strokan believes that the New START is sending a powerful message to the world community When we discuss the importance of the START treaty, we have to understand that it is not only the deepest cuts of nuclear weapons in world history, ù he said ùThe treaty is definitely an important political and psychological message, a message to the world powers that nuclear weapons are obsolete, they do not fit into the defense strategies of the world powers They have to cut them ùStrokan added that getting rid of nuclear weapons will make the US and Russia stronger † Definitely, it will make them stronger because it envisages not only cuts of nuclear weapons but also both sides would have to undergo modernizing of their potential, ù he said That is why their military force will be more up to date ù Professor of politics at the University of Kent, Adrian Pabst, told RT that the new treaty is a practical step toward genuine reset ù between Russia and the United States † † It is a confidence building measure The reset has often been dismissed as just nice rhetoric with little action, but now we have a concrete outcome of the reset in US Russia relations and I think that both sides want to build on this, ù he said Yury Rogulev from the Franklin Roosevelt Foundation of US Studies said that hopes are high that other countries will follow the example of the United States and Russia † The importance of this agreement is the example to the other countries, ù he said First of all, to those countries that do have nuclear armaments and to those countries who do not agree to join the non proliferation movement This agreement between the United States and Russia, I think, would promote the non proliferation process and would help to include other countries to the process of arms reduction ù   ",https://www.rt.com/news/russia-us-start-ratified/
"1 Feb, 2011",Remembering Yeltsin,"For many westerners, memories of Boris Yeltsin are filled with images of a fun loving, unpredictable and occasionally reckless individual who in some ways was the very personification of Russia itself Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation, was unlike any other leader of modern times Dancing on stage with girls during a live musical performance on Red Square; causing former US President Bill Clinton to convulse in a fit of uncontrollable laughter at the podium; standing on top of a tank at the height of the Soviet attempt at a coup d √©tat, exposing himself to the gravest danger These are just a few of the many indelible memories left behind by the man who almost singlehandedly brought down the sprawling Soviet Union According to Nikolay Svanidze, Yeltsin gave Russia stability, the Constitution, democratic government, free market economy and free press This is enough to recognize Yeltsin as a prominent and definitely positive historical figure, albeit a controversial one For Russia, Boris Yeltsin was the right man at the right time, and the time was certainly ripe for the epic collapse of an empire like Rome that was suffering from imperial overstretch and bankruptcy Although there are vastly differing opinions about Yeltsin, and the role he played in Russian history, historians are practically unanimous in the belief he helped to initiate the dissolution of the Soviet Union with the minimal amount of violence and loss of human life This achievement in itself is enough to immortalize Yeltsin in the annals of world history Indeed, nobody in the West could have predicted that such a massive and powerful regime as the Soviet Union would one day implode with little more than a whimper In a series of remarkable events, which seemed to western observers at the time as nothing more than cosmetic reforms as opposed to the epic changing events they were becoming, Yeltsin quit the Communist Party in 1990; in June 1991 he emerged victorious in Russia s first direct, popular elections for the presidency Then, during a dramatic coup attempt to overthrow Gorbachev in August 1991, Yeltsin never lost his nerve He organized a nearly bloodless resistance of democratic forces in Moscow against the hard line communist challenge, thus emerging as the country s most powerful politician It is one thing, however, to topple a government † indeed, an empire † but a completely different thing to transform an economy And that was the awesome challenge that faced Yeltsin and the Russian people following the collapse of communism and the embrace of free market capitalism Suddenly, overnight, Russia was consumed by a privatization spree, with factories, companies and even the nation s vast natural resources falling under the control of a handful of tycoons The quest for power and profits in the 1990s became the modern equivalent of Russia s past Time of Troubles ù They have also been rightly compared to America s gangland hits of the Roaring 1920s On the streets of Moscow and beyond, contract killings were occurring in broad daylight, while corruption was rampant Meanwhile, Yeltsin was starting to attract public criticism as the Kremlin was falling under the sway of a tightly knit group of economic and political insiders known as The Family ùDespite Russia being ravaged by this complex cocktail of economic, political and social ills, Yeltsin managed to beat off a challenge by the leader of the Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov in the 1996 presidential election Yeltsin managed to attract 53 percent of the vote to Zyuganov s 40 percent in a runoff election Yeltsin, however, recovering from two heart attacks, was now entering the most challenging moments of his dual presidency Not only was Russia s transformation to a free market economy becoming increasingly chaotic (on August 17, 1998, Russia experienced a severe financial crisis as the ruble collapsed, wiping out the savings of ordinary Russians, while destroying thousands of businesses), but the hot coals of war in Chechnya under Yeltsin (Dec 1994 to Aug 1996) were starting to rekindle The last years of Yeltsin s presidency were spent reshuffling the government as four premiers came and went In 1999, the State Duma even attempted to impeach Yeltsin, claiming that he had encouraged the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, among other charges This political setback was followed by a wave of bombings that hit four apartment buildings in Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk, which left 293 people dead, 651 wounded and the country badly shaken By this time late in his political career, Yeltsin, ever the captain of his own destiny, understood better than anybody that events were moving beyond his ability to control them In yet another surprise move that caught the world unawares, Russia s first president announced his resignation on December 31, 1999, ushering the way for Vladimir Putin In hindsight, Yeltsin s final act as president of Russia has been a resounding success: Under Putin s dual presidency, the Kremlin cleaned its corridors of the tycoons who were complicit in the collapse of Russia s economy; the uncertainty over Chechnya has dramatically decreased albeit it at a high human and material cost; Russia has returned to the center stage as a respected global player a little over two decades following the near fatal collapse of the Soviet Union Although part of the reason for Russia s triumphant return from the edge of the abyss is its wealth of natural resources, this explanation only partially explains the turnaround, while failing to appreciate what could be best described as smart, pragmatic politics on Putin s watch That tradition now continues under President Dmitry Medvedev, where Russia continues to develop its economic, social and political infrastructure in pragmatic fashion The legacy of Boris Yeltsin carries on, and Russia is certainly the better for it Robert Bridge, RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/boris-yeltsin-russia-anniversary/

dignity for all citizens Sergey Lavrov will speak on the Global Challenges ù theme We look forward to a fruitful discussion on all important issues: overcoming the effects of the global financial and economic crisis; sustainable development; global and regional issues; human contacts; and streamlining ASEM activities In Brussels, Sergey Lavrov will also have a number of bilateral meetings with foreign participants of the summit The 65th UN General Assembly session is continuing in New York Please note, the text of the statement made by Russia s Permanent Representative to the UN Vitaly Churkin during the general debate is published on the Ministry website An OSCE Review Conference is opening in Warsaw today It will precede the OSCE s summit to be held December 1 2, 2010 in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, chair of the Organization in 2010 There will be three parts of the Review Conference: in Warsaw (30 September 8 October), Vienna (18 26 October) and Astana (26 28 November) It will examine how member states are fulfilling their political commitments assumed in the politico military, economic environmental and humanitarian dimensions of security, and how effectively the OSCE executive structures do their job its Secretariat, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, High Commissioner on National Minorities, the Representative on Freedom of the Media, and field missions operating in 16 countries in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Central Asia and the Trans Caucasus The Russian delegation at the conference will comprise experts from the relevant ministries and agencies Representatives of civil society organizations (NGOs) will also take part Russia has faithfully fulfilled and will continue to fulfill all the political commitments it assumed within the OSCE We urge all other member states to do the same We call for reviewing the political commitments that have been unjustly forgotten, such as the freedom of movement/liberalization of visa regimes in the first place We look forward to a thorough and constructive discussion on the strengthening of confidence building and security instruments in the military domain, and their adaptation to the new conditions and practice of military construction We consider it necessary to begin serious work on correcting imbalances in the work of the OSCE institutions and field missions, which today, unfortunately, is characterized by a selective ù approach and focuses mainly on the countries east of Vienna ù We consistently advocate transforming the OSCE into a fully fledged intergovernmental organization that works according to clearly defined, collectively agreed rules An important step in this direction would be the adoption of a Charter of the OSCE The delegation intends to raise all these and other issues at the Review Conference that opened today We believe if all OSCE states without exception, regardless of their participation in military alliances or other associations, equally and faithfully fulfill their obligations across the board, then we will be able to create a truly indivisible area of equal security and co operation from Vancouver to Vladivostok We hope that the Review Conference will contribute to the success of the OSCE Summit, the chief objective of which in our view is to reaffirm and strengthen the principle of indivisibility of security and to increase the relevance of the OSCE as a platform for dialogue and joint action in areas of common interests throughout the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok Work on the draft Russian Polish intergovernmental agreement on local border traffic, which aims to extend the simplified travel regime to the whole of Kaliningrad Region, as well as the adjacent areas of Poland, is now practically over The only obstacle to its conclusion is the EU rule that sets border zone width at 30km If mechanically applied to the Russian Polish agreement, the approach would leave Kaliningrad Region divided into two parts, landing its residents in an unequal position, in terms of the regime for travel to Poland In this regard, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, guided by the tasks of further deepening Russian Polish co operation in various fields and expanding the range of measures aimed at the overall facilitation of contacts between citizens of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Poland and of Russia and the EU member states, sent a joint appeal to their EU counterparts and the European Commission calling for improvement of the existing internal EU rules governing local border traffic The corresponding document is transmitted to the recipients through diplomatic channels We count on a constructive response from the European colleagues and on an early positive decision by the European Commission The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Embassy in Venezuela (our ambassador in Caracas is concurrently accredited to Santo Domingo), with the active co operation of Children Rights Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov and officials from several other Russian agencies, have solved the question of the repatriation of Dmitry Khokhryakov, an underage Russian citizen (born in 1998), seven years ago taken by his adoptive parents to the Dominican Republic and then left there to the mercy of fate Upon receipt of the documents, local authorities promptly and favorably responded to our request for the return of the child, for which Sergey Lavrov personally thanked the President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, during their bilateral meeting in New York on September 23 On September 27, Pavel Astakhov flew to Santo Domingo He will accompany the boy to Russia (the flight to Moscow is scheduled for September 30) The head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Venezuela is also there now; he is rendering the Ombudsman all necessary assistance The latest expert consultation in July basically produced the agreed text of a Russian US adoption agreement, meant to provide reliable guarantees for the rights of adopted children Now the parties are to complete internal interagency approvals for the draft A final round of bilateral negotiations will then follow, resulting in the submission of the agreement for signature Hopefully this can happen before the end of this year The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela held elections to the National Assembly on September 26 Supporters of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won a majority of seats in the supreme legislative body of the country We note with satisfaction that the polls, witnessing voter turnout of more than 65 per cent, passed in compliance with democratic norms and principles, in a peaceful and transparent manner Representatives of the Russian Central Election Commission and deputies of the State Duma, who were in friendly Venezuela as members of the Program of International Election Monitoring, underscore the competent preparation and good organization of the voting process We commend the responsible attitude of the main political parties of Venezuela, which have accepted the results of the expression of the people s will In recent months we have been following the dynamics of the complicated situation in Kyrgyzstan with special attention On October 10, citizens of the country will elect deputies to the Zhogorku Kenesh the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic Of course, this is a major event in social and political life, and a landmark moment in the evolution of the democratic process in Kyrgyzstan We would hope that the elections will be held in a relaxed atmosphere, fairly and transparently, and will make it possible to form the highest legislative and then executive bodies of power in the Republic capable of coherent, efficient operation At the invitation of the Kyrgyz side, it is planned to send Russian election observers on behalf of the Central Election Commission of Russia, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, EurAsEC, the SCO, and as members of the monitoring mission of the OSCE/ODIHR As previously noted, the Russian side at the request of the Kyrgyz partners is providing all necessary assistance in selecting and equipping polling stations in several Russian cities for the voting of citizens of Kyrgyzstan staying temporarily in the territory of our country We are talking mainly about Kyrgyz labor migrants Those in Russia, according to the Federal Migration Service, number about 300,000 If necessary, we would be willing to make additional voting facilities available to this category of Kyrgyz citizens who wish to use them On the working trip of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs/State Secretary Grigory Karasin to Kyrgyzstan and his meeting with the co chairing Troika of Geneva Discussions on Security and Stability in the Trans CaucasusRussian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs/State Secretary Grigory Karasin made a working trip to Kyrgyzstan on September 27 29 During his trip Karasin visited, apart from Bishkek, the city of Osh and met with representatives of several political parties and movements of the Republic On September 29, in Moscow, he met the co chairing Troika of Geneva Discussions on Security and Stability in the Trans Caucasus representing the EU, UN and OSCE They discussed the political and military aspects of the situation in the Trans Caucasus, and preparations for the 13th round of Geneva Discussions, scheduled for mid October I was asked by Reuters: How can the Russian Foreign Ministry comment on the situation with the extradition of Tajik opposition leader Mahmadruzi Iskandarov from Russia, while the European Court of Human Rights found that his removal was unlawful and fined the authorities of the Russian Federation? ù On September 23, 2010 the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights rendered its judgment on the merits of the Iskandarov vs Russia complaint, in which it ruled that the Russian authorities had violated Article 3 (prohibition of torture) and Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Procedurally, the Court ruling is not final In accordance with the provisions of the European Convention, an ECHR Chamber judgment comes into force in three months if neither party appeals against it to the Grand Chamber Currently, the ruling is being scrutinized by competent Russian agencies, in particular, in the Office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the ECHR and in the Prosecutor General s Office of the Russian Federation The World Thematic Conference of Compatriots will be held in Moscow from October 7 8, 2010 Its organizers plan to invite 150 representatives of

Diplomas Venue: Moscow, Olympiyskiy Prospekt, 18/1, Renaissance Moscow Hotel, Conference Room Theater ù Q: The British side has said that the new British Foreign Secretary William Hague is to make a visit to Russia soon How can you comment on this statement? A: I can confirm that we are waiting for the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs William Hague in Moscow in mid October He will visit the Russian capital at the invitation of Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov The upcoming talks will focus on the state of, and prospects for co operation between Russia and the UK, in the bilateral sphere as well as on pressing international and regional issues Given some recent positive changes in Russian British relations and the intensified political contacts we hope that the upcoming visit of William Hague will help build on these trends Q: The other day some Japanese media quoted the Foreign Minister of Japan as saying that he had handed to the Russian ambassador a request for the Russian President not to visit the Kuril Islands Could you comment on these statements? Is it true that the Russian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry of Japan? A: In the past two days, we have seen many reports and comments on this matter I can say just this The President of Russia independently determines the routes of his trips on the territory of his country, and any advice ù here is inappropriate and unacceptable Moscow has taken note of the fact that senior Japanese officials recently voiced publicly the well known position of Tokyo on the question of sovereignty over the South Kurils, claiming that they belong to Japan So we consider it necessary to once again state that these islands are the territory of the Russian Federation owing to the international legal reality that emerged following World War II and which is enshrined in particular in the UN Charter We are convinced that in the interests of the sustained development of bilateral relations Japan should avoid counter productively repeating dead end positions in statements, take active steps to expand co operation in key areas, strengthen constructive co operation in international affairs, and quietly continue the dialogue on a mutually acceptable solution to the question of the conclusion of a peace treaty and subsequent border demarcation The Ambassador of Russia to Japan recently took advantage of an invitation from the leadership of the Japanese Foreign Ministry to present this Russian position Q: On September 25 Minister Lavrov said that Russia had received an invitation to attend a Russia NATO summit According to him, a report is being prepared to President Medvedev Is there any progress in this matter? A: Minister Lavrov has said a lot about this, and yesterday Deputy Minister Alexander Grushko gave a detailed interview to Interfax news agency detailing our arguments in this regard Q: Chairman of the Iranian parliament s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said that the question of Russia s refusal to deliver S 300 missile systems to Iran would be solved judicially, implying lawsuits among other things What s Russia s reaction? Do you expect any lawsuits? A: Our position on this issue is exhaustively stated in President Medvedev s Decree No 1154 of September 22, 2010 It remains unchanged With regard to possible actions by Iran, we need to acquaint ourselves with them in detail, and then we can make some conclusions and comments Q: Could you elaborate on the outcome of the consultation in Vienna on Transdniestr?A: With regard to the outcome of the consultation we will soon publish an official comment on that Q: How can you comment on the statement of US State Secretary Hillary Clinton during the RNC meeting in New York that all countries, including Georgia and Moldova have the right to decide the question of the presence of foreign troops on their territory, including in the context of Transdniestr? A: With regard to the RNC, its meeting was held behind closed doors I haven t seen any news reports broadcasting this or that statement I am not familiar with this statement of Hillary Clinton, so I cannot comment on it Q: Could you comment on the statement of Moldova s Deputy Prime Minister that the evolution of the Transndiestrian conflict offers the possibility that the US and the EU could become mediators in this process? A: The current format is embedded in the relevant multilateral agreements To change it, you need substantive consultation and the consent of all those who are part of this format Q: What is the position of the Russian Federation with regard to Iran, which has expressed willingness to negotiate with the Six, as well as in respect of the US and Western countries that conduct unilateral sanctions against Iran? A: If Tehran s readiness is realized in practical matters, then it is welcome, because we have always called for a politico diplomatic solution to the issue and waited for positive steps from Tehran As to your second question, it has repeatedly been commented upon There is nothing I can add to what Minister Lavrov said during his news conferences Q: Is there any information that President Medvedev might visit the South Kurils during a trip to the summit of the Big Twenty and APEC in Japan? A: The President addressed this issue while on the Kamchatka Peninsula I can add nothing more Q: The Russian ship Lyubov Orlova, with 49 Russians on board, has reportedly been arrested at a Canadian port The seafarers are trying to contact the Foreign Ministry Do you have more information on this? A: Russia s ambassador to Canada informed us yesterday that he is in contact with Canadian authorities, who are taking the necessary legal steps to decide the fate of the ship As for the crew, 49 Russian citizens are among those on board Because they are in the territory of a foreign state, they will receive all necessary consular and other assistance to protect their rights I repeat our Embassy is in touch with Canadians and with the representatives of the crew The issue is being solved judicially RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/nesterenko-briefing-arctic-problems/
"23 Jul, 2010",UN court ruling doesn‚Äôt change Moscow‚Äôs stance on Kosovo,"The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that the International Court of Justice s ruling will not change Moscow s stance on Kosovo independence: Russia does not recognize it On Thursday, theUN s highest court ruledthat Kosovo s declaration of independence from Serbia was legitimate It is crucially important that the court has only assessed Kosovo s Declaration of Independence, underlining that it has not considered more widely Kosovo s right to unilateral secession from Serbia, ùthe Ministry s statement reads as published on its official website Also, in its conclusions the Court has not assessed either the consequences of the adoption of this document, namely whether Kosovo is a state, or the legitimacy of its recognition by a number of countries ù According to Leonid Slutsky, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma s International Affairs Committee, the court s ruling could be likened to Pandora s box ù I can foresee a lot of dangerous trends emerging globally, similar to what was going on in Kosovo at one time, ùhe told Interfax news agency The politician believes it is awful ù that the majority of the world s advanced nations backed the position of unilateral recognition of Kosovo s self proclaimed independence The decision is extremely strange ùand also is an example of how double standards are being applied in the politics of many countries Kosovo s self proclaimed independence is recognized as normal, while the independence proclaimed by Abkhazia and South Ossetia is not recognized by an overwhelming majority of the international community, ù he said The ICJ s decision is a clearly collective and very serious twist in international politics, in institutions of law and in the world s leading nations, ùSlutsky concluded The Hague Court s decision will not have any judicial consequences, said Aleksandr Torshin, first vice speaker of Russia s upper house, the Federation Council The UN Court has no moral right to address this sort of issues The decision made on Kosovo creates a dangerous precedent, ùhe told Interfax agency on Friday It was with the connivance of the UN Court that former Yugoslavia and Serbia were bombarded; it was with its connivance that Kosovo militants were eliminating civilians, ruining Serbian temples, ùhe said He added that he knows the situation in Kosovo very well and witnessed what was happening during the conflict with his own eyes In addition, the official believes, The Hague s decision is unlikely to lead to prosperity in Kosovo and even less likely to ease tenses in the region This precedent, according to Torshin, raises a question: why can Kosovo get independence while South Ossetia and Abkhazia cannot? The media and analysts have been reading tea leaves trying to predict the possible consequences of the UN Court s opinion on Kosovo and suggesting scenarios it would lead to on the international arena The politicians remain split over the issue The opponents of Kosovo independence insist on the principle of territorial integrity as set by international law They cite UN Security Council Resolution 1244 signed in 1999 which set the principles of the solution to the Kosovo crisis Having set up an interim UN administration in the region, it also stressed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Therefore, Kosovo had no right to unilaterally declare independence, thus violating international law The states that back Pristina, however, claim that the Kosovo case is in some ways unique According to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Kosovo strived for independence and many there believed the region was made part of Yugoslavia against its will In addition, tensions in the country resulted in ethnic cleansing ùcommitted by Serbs against the Kosovo population, she said in an interview with Russian Channel One in March this year The top US diplomat, however, stressed that no parallels can be drawn between the Kosovo case and independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia since the situations are very different ù Georgia, she said, used to be a united country where different ethnic groups lived and those groups should have remained together, she was quoted as saying Still, Deputy Interior Minister of South Ossetia Kazbulat Tskhovrebov said he hopes that the precedent set by the court decision could someday be of benefit to South Ossetia I would like to hope that the declaration of independence by South Ossetia and Abkhazia will also be considered within UN walls, ù Tskhovrebov said So that we have a chance to prove from a high podium that the independence of South Ossetia is not against international law either ù In August 2008 following Georgia s attack on the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinval Russia had to use its troops to protect the republic s population, many of whom are Russian citizens Shortly after the war, Moscow recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia Washington, however, keeps referring to Russia s actions as an occupation of Georgia ù We continue to object to and criticize actions by Russia which we believe are wrong and on the top of the list is the invasion and occupation of Georgia, ùClinton said at a meeting with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili In April this year,speaking at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Russia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovreminded that in 2008, during meetings before the August war between Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin and Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, the Russian side offered its assistance in a conflict resolution on a basis of the territorial integrity of Georgia, but insisted that a document on the non use of force was to be signed As the Russian foreign minister said, you know what was next ùLate in the evening on August 7, 2008, Georgian forces began massive artillery bombardment of the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinval When we responded to the attacks on our peacekeepers and civilians of Tskhinval and other villages, we had no geopolitical intentions We were saving people, ùLavrov stressed After the conflict in South Ossetia, the Georgian president refused to discuss the status of the republics, Lavrov said it means that the war in [Saakashvili s] head is not finished yet ùNatalia Makarova, RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/kosovo-independence-moscow-stance/
"9 Jul, 2010",ROAR: Playing the game of START ratification,"Communists and Liberal Democrats in Russia s parliament have promised to vote against the new START treaty While the majority of deputies can ratify the deal, they will wait for their colleagues from the US The State Duma Defense Committee on July 8 recommended the parliament to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States The deputies analyzed the deal and concluded that Russia would still be able to reliably ensure its security, ùthe committee s chairman Viktor Zavarzin said However, Russian deputies are not in a hurry to ratify the document The discussion in the Duma s Foreign Affairs Committee is continuing However, next week it will take a pause to see what is going on in the US Senate,the committee s head Konstantin Kosachev told RT Kosachev does not see any obstacles, but some deputies think differently The factions of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) and the Communist Party in the lower house said they would not vote for the ratification The LDPR did not vote for ratification of the previous treaty and now it will not vote as well, ùthe party s leader and State Duma deputy speaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky said on July 7 Signing the document, Russia reduces its warheads and becomes weaker, ùhe added Zhirinovsky noted that Russia is surrounded by NATO bases, and Washington did not fulfill the provisions of the previous treaty ùThat agreement forced Russia to cut and destroy nuclear warheads and scrap missiles ùwhile Americans stored the warheads, ùthe politician said He supported the reduction of arms in general, but stressed that Russia should not come out of the deal a loser The LDPR leader promised that the deputies of his faction will push all 40 buttons ùwhile voting against the treaty And those who vote for the ratification will be immediately expelled from the faction, he added The Communists also refused to support the treaty As the deal comes into effect, Russia s defense interests will be vulnerable, said Leonid Kalashnikov, a representative of the Communist Party s faction Until a program of modernizing Russia s nuclear potential is submitted and funds are allocated to it, the faction will not vote for the treaty, he said The ruling United Russia party, which has a majority in the parliament, and representatives of Fair Russia party said they would support the ratification Aleksandr Burutin, first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, said the doubts of the deputies are to a certain extent justified ùThe two factions also reacted to the recent visit by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Poland, ù he said Burutin described the treaty as a product of certain compromises, ùbut stressed it was signed in the interests of both countries and did not violate strategic stability Also, either party is able to withdraw from the treaty Meanwhile, observers predict there will be no problems with the ratification in Russia, but the voting on the treaty may be postponed The treaty is doomed ù to be ratified, Gazeta daily said, but added Russian deputies are waiting for the moves of their colleagues in the US Senate The situation is not as ideal as it seems ùin the Senate, the deputy and political scientist Sergey Markov told the paper If the Senate does not ratify the treaty, the ratification process will be blocked in Russia too, Markov said At the same time, if the Russian president and the government supports the document, the possibility that the State Duma votes against it is minimal, the deputy stressed According to Konstantin Kosachev, the two Duma committees showed the technical readiness to ratify the treaty Political readiness will be determined by the factions of the State Duma, taking into account the US Senate s position ù The State Duma and the Federation Council, the upper house, will not be in a hurry to ratify the treaty, Izvestia daily noted The Russian deputies have actually decided to let their American colleagues do it first, the paper added It is necessary to ratify the document, but not to hasten, because the chances for the ratification in the Senate have deteriorated, ùbelieves Sergey Rogov, director of the Russian Institute of the US and Canada studies The senators may postpone the process of ratification till the November elections when the Republicans may get new seats or even return the control over the senate, he told the paper So, it is necessary to track the developments of the inner political struggle in the US, he said, to avoid the situation when we ratify it, but the Republicans there block the ratification ù The ratification in the parliaments has political meaning, Izvestia said Analysts believe that the parties may not ratify the START treaty, but they will observe its requirements ù Russia s Duma may ratify the treaty at any moment, Kommersant daily said United Russia controls 315 seats, while 226 votes are needed But the deputies deliberately allow the enemies of the ratification, ù mostly in the US, to have their say, the paper said At the same time, the daily highlighted the drift ù of Russia s position on the link between strategic arms and missile defense Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has asked the Foreign Affairs Committee to recommend the ratification But he recognized, the paper said, that Russia was not seeking to limit America s missile defenses while preparing the treaty There are no such limitations in this treaty, ùhe said A diplomatic source told the paper that a game is being played to neutralize enemies of the ratification ù We are closely watching what they [in the US] are speaking about it, and they are doing the same, ùthe source said There is a certain element of a

"29 Jun, 2010",Detained Russians were not spying ‚Äì ministry,"Russia s Foreign Ministry says the suspected spies arrested in the US include Russian citizens, though they did nothing to hurt American interests Moscow is counting on the US to show proper understanding, taking into account the positive character of Russian US relations, the official ministry statement issued Tuesday evening said Meanwhile, Russia s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressed hopes the ties between Moscow and Washington won t be harmed by the incident Your police have let themselves go They are puttingpeople in prison, ùthe Russian Premier said at a meeting with former US President Bill Clinton in Moscow We hope that positive things achieved in recent years will be preserved We also hope that people who value good relations understand that The US State Department says no Russian diplomats will be expelled in connection with the breakup of alleged Russian spy ring The US law enforcement acted appropriately ùin the arrests of alleged Russian spies, but it will not affect US Russia relations, Washington said Tuesday White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Tuesday that US President Barack Obama ùwas fully and appropriately informed ùabout the matter This was a law enforcement action, and law enforcement acted appropriately And he (Obama) did not have a personal reaction that I know of, ùGibbs said as quoted on the White House official website The press secretary said Obama knew about the investigation when he met with Russia s President Dmitry Medvedev in Washington last week, but the two did not discuss the issue ùI do not believe that this will affect the reset of our relationship with Russia, ùGibbs told journalists We have made great progress in the past year and a half, working on issues of mutual concern from a new START treaty to working together on things like in the United Nations dealing with North Korea and Iran ù The arrests were strictly law enforcement operations, believes Ivan Eland, director of the Centre on Peace and Liberty at the Independent Institute in Washington But I don t think this was in any sort of attempt to put a dagger in a heart of improved Russian US relations, ùhe said Moreover, the US counts on further improvements in relations with Russia despite the spy scandal, Dr Philip Gordon, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said at a briefing Tuesday The State Department is in contact with Russian authorities and negotiations regarding the incident are underway both in Washington and in Moscow, he said Russia s Foreign Ministry echoed Gibbs, saying that the scandal will not affect Moscow Washington relations We hope that the incident linked to the arrest of a group of people in the US on suspicion of spying for Russia will not have a negative impact on Russian American relations, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said, Interfax reports We have taken note of the statement given by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, he added However political experts have a different view on the things The political forces on both sides that are traditionally opposing the closer ties between Russia and the US are most likely to be the fire starters, because the spy scandal will certainly affect the reset ù process between the two, they believe The real problem is not to give a chance to these facts to overwhelm and start defining Russian American relations after the successful visit of the Russian President to the US, ùbelieves Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies Still, Barack Obama will let the security services do their job to judge later if the threat to national security of the US was a real one Maybe I am too optimistic, but I think one of the outcomes of this situation will be [an] understanding of the need to look to revise deeply the type of our relationship, maybe just go ahead with the developing of mutual trust of co operation and mutual assistance, ùKremenyuk says Deputy Head of Russia s State Duma Security Commission, Vladimir Kolesnikov agrees, adding there are many in the political circles of the United States who cannot drop the Cold War way of thinking and give up their double standards The thaw that began taking shape with coming to power of the two new young presidents who are set for constructive relations in all directions, wasn t welcomed at some levels of American society As result, the given situation happened, ùKolesnikov said, explaining his view on the nature of the incident The American spy network is very active, and it is no secret that agents of US intelligence services still work ùin Russia, Kolesnikov added Previously Russia, when such were detected, quietly deported them from the country, making them persona non grata ù, but now it should start taking criminal prosecutions, he said I think it s very clear that President Obama did not particularly enjoy the timing, didn t think the timing benefited him, ù said Chris Lapetina, an analyst for the Democratic Strategist Lapetina agreed with the theory that the parties involved in the arrests may have intentionally disregarded the warming in Russia US relations My guess would be that somebody did not care that the president would not agree with this timing and felt it was in their own best interest to make these arrests now And in doing so, definitely put a damper on an accomplishment for the president that was seen as this successful trip by the Russian president that happened recently in DC   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/detained-russian-not-spies/

Lavrov s meeting with members of the World Co ordination Council of Russian CompatriotsOn May 19, Sergey Lavrov, Chairman of the Government s Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, had a traditional meeting at the MFA Mansion with members of the World Co ordination Council of Russian Compatriots, which these days is holding a session in Moscow I was asked: Could you comment on the statement by Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite at the ceremony of bestowal of awards on the forest brethren ù on May 14, in which the President asserted that the struggle of the so called partisans ù not only slowed assimilation and destruction of national identity, ù but also showed that Lithuania s joining the USSR voluntarily ù was a myth?Such statements of Grybauskaite vividly illustrate the duality of Lithuanian politics How else can one explain the fact that, on the one hand, Vilnius offers numerous assurances of the willingness to develop pragmatic co operation with Russia in a spirit of mutual understanding and trust, and on the other, it undertakes attempts to exploit the issues of our common history and to foist a tendentious concept of Soviet occupation ù on the civil societies of the two countries Lithuania must understand that it is impossible to build co operation with the Russian Federation on the desire to manipulate the historical memory to suit domestic political expediency With this approach of the Lithuanian leadership to the creation of a politico informational background of our interstate relations to talk about the prospects of achieving a qualitatively new level of Russian Lithuanian dialogue seems to be premature I would like to draw your attention to the Russian Foreign Ministry statement in connection with the pronouncement on May 17 of the ruling of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the case of Vasily Kononov I ll repeat once again that its contents are being carefully studied in Russia As you know, the website of the Ministry has hosted a special statement In our assessment, one can speak about a very dangerous precedent that causes us great concern We regard the verdict of the Grand Chamber not just as a revision of the fair ruling the Court Chamber in this case, handed down on July 24, 2008, but as an attempt to cast doubt on several key political and legal principles that emerged following World War II and the postwar arrangement in Europe, particularly with regard to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals Once again I will stress: we are sure that the Russian and international juridical community will have its weighty say in designating the legal consequences of the decision On May 19, the media commented extensively on the press conference at Interfax News Agency in which Tatiana Anodina, head of the Interstate Aviation Committee, gave clarifications regarding the work done by Russian and Polish specialists to decipher transcripts of the flight data recorders of the Polish President s plane that crashed near Smolensk on April 10, 2010 I can stress once again that a draft memorandum of understanding was transmitted to Warsaw on May 18 via diplomatic channels, the signing of which on behalf of the state commissions of Russia and Poland, and the Interstate Aviation Committee as an international body conducting an independent technical investigation of the causes of the air crash near Smolensk on April 10 will make it possible to resolve the issues of a transfer to the Polish side at its request of copies of the transcripts of the flight data recorders of the Republic of Poland Tu 154M plane, airframe 101, with regard to a number of restrictions related to the norms of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and to the ICAO regulations I ll stress that the work on the memorandum with the Polish partners is proceeding vigorously We presume that this tripartite document can be agreed upon in a short space of time and, accordingly, the procedure for transfer of copies of the transcripts of the decoded cockpit voice recorders will be held in the near future We hope in co operation with the Polish side to do so during May I have been asked: How can the Russian Foreign Ministry comment on the report by Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State and head of the Group of Wise Men, on NATO s new Strategic Concept, which she submitted on May 17 at NATO headquarters in Brussels? ùWe will carefully study the detailed report prepared by the Albright led group at the direction of the NATO Secretary General with recommendations for NATO s new Strategic Concept, which is expected to be endorsed at the Alliance summit in Lisbon in November this year Our preliminary analysis of the document leaves a dual impression On the one hand, it contains a lot of constructive ideas for a Euro Atlantic system of co operative security, the adequate embedding of NATO in a scheme of international efforts at peacekeeping and responding to modern challenges and threats based on the recognition of the role of the UN and international law and a rational division of labor ù with the EU, OSCE, CSTO, SCO and other existing security structures It is proposed to more clearly define the objectives of NATO as a regional organization which does not seek the functions of a global policeman ù and does not aspire to leadership in non core areas of security An important statement by the example of Afghanistan that military means cannot achieve a long term post conflict stabilization, and that an integrated effort is needed with emphasis on political and socio economic assistance, involving all key players It is these points that have been discussed repeatedly by us with our partners in NATO, and this was also the focus of the conversations with the Group of Wise Men in Moscow in February this year, of which we informed you in detail We note the recommendations in the report for a qualitative improvement of relations with Russia through the strengthening of mutual trust and by the expansion of partnership based on common security interests: Afghanistan, missile defense, arms control, crisis response, and the struggle against terrorism, piracy, the proliferation of WMD and drug trafficking For our part, we have always stressed our commitment to open dialogue in the Russia NATO Council on problematic issues and to a sustained buildup of mutually beneficial partnerships with the NATO countries in countering the real challenges to stability in the Euro Atlantic space However, it has not escaped our attention that the report also includes a number of prejudiced clich√©s from another era, in our judgment, with regard to our country Apparently, some members of the Group of Wise Men find difficulty realizing the changes that have occurred in the world since the end of Cold War and the priorities of contemporary Russia Hence the clearly unjustified from the view of common sense, and the realities of today, hyperbolization of the defensive ù functions of the alliance under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty The suggestions for NATO to maintain a free hand in deciding on the use of its military capabilities, or acting according to the situation, ù including outside its traditional sphere of responsibility, also raise questions The report s formula of the anti NATO focus of the Russian initiative for a European Security Treaty, despite the many clarifications given by us in this regard, likewise cannot but evoke surprise We hope that in further work on the draft of NATO s new Strategic Concept the mindset will prevail for transformations in the alliance which would serve the interests of strengthening stability and predictability in politico military affairs, building a common space of indivisible security in the Euro Atlantic area, and co operating more effectively in responding to the real common challenges and threats This would benefit all I would like to draw attention to the news reports concerning the draft of a so called UN Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran ù I can only direct you to our position on this matter, as detailed in the press release on the MFA site about the outcome of the telephone conversation between Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held on May 18 The heads of the foreign affairs agencies of the two countries had a thorough exchange of views on the situation surrounding the Iranian nuclear program, particularly with regard to the Declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Iran and Turkey signed in Tehran on May 17, with suggestions for resolving the issue of swapping Iran s low enriched uranium for fuel for the Tehran research reactor The Minister and the Secretary of State exchanged views on the impact that this move could have on the preparation of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iran The Russian side confirmed that the principled understanding achieved within the 5 +1 ù group on the draft resolution remains valid and that, at the next phase, work is to be continued in the Security Council already, where the nonpermanent Security Council members will have the opportunity to express their attitude towards the draft It was also noted that at the same time a thorough analysis of the post declaration situation has to be carried out, particularly in terms of the need for Iran to act speedily to comply with its provisions, primarily through a formal application to the IAEA Lavrov drew attention to the document s assessment given by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference in Kiev on May 17, and stressed that agreeing on generally acceptable ways to implement the Brazil Turkey initiative would help establish a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of politico diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue as a whole The full text of the press release on the outcome of this telephone conversation is posted on the MFA website RIA Novosti asked me a clarification question: The draft of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iran has a paragraph about embargo on the supply of missiles Is it about offensive or defensive missiles or all types of missiles? Will that resolution, if adopted, mean the end of Russia s plans to supply S 300 systems to Iran? ùIf you show me such a draft resolution, I'll be ready to comment on it Concerning how the situation is evolving with regard to the UN Security Council I again draw your attention to the telephone conversation between Lavrov and Clinton Signed in Kiev on May 17, 2010, the Joint Statement of the Presidents of the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Transdniestrian settlement has, as anticipated, attracted international attention The document articulated the vision by the states acting as mediators and guarantors of a just and comprehensive settlement of the problem, of the basic principles for continued search of a political compromise and noted the key factors designed to ensure stability in the region Against a background of stalled efforts to restore mutual understanding between Chisinau and Tiraspol, the clear position statement provides a timely and significant contribution to the consolidation of international mediation in this regard By all appearances, the Moldovan side had beforehand disposed itself to receive the signal from Kiev skeptically, openly expressing doubts as to whether the statement would have a political and legal impact on the process of conflict resolution Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat s official comment on May 18 boiled down to just this: Moldova is ready to immediately engage in constructive negotiations with the Transdniestrians in an international format, and regards the beginning of consultations on the transformation of the regional peacekeeping operation and removal of the Russian contingent in the conflict zone as the main condition Indeed, the fact that a settlement can only be achieved in the negotiations between the parties to the conflict, and that the elaboration of a special and reliably guaranteed status for Transdniestr is expected in this context, which, in turn, will prompt an international peace guaranteeing format to replace the current peacekeeping one, is confirmed by the formulations of the Kiev document We would not like to think that behind the striking slogans to reach an immediate agreement about everything ù is hidden the intention to put pressure on the opponent, and not to negotiate on equal terms Since the spring of 2006, the conditions have not yet been restored for even the resumption of the consultation format òPermanent Conference on political issues within the framework of the Transdniestrian negotiation process The politico constitutional crisis on the right bank of the Dniester, the ambiguous statements by Moldovan political leaders about the future orientation of the country, and the absence of the settlement model itself dramatically weaken the prerequisites for mutual accommodation of the conflicting parties The Russian Federation bases its mediation in resolving the Transdniestrian problem on the continuity of the agreements reached in the negotiation process and on the observance of the international principles of settlement It has always been interested in restoring the territorial integrity of Moldova and strengthening its sovereignty and constitutional neutrality The fact that these positions are fully shared by the state leadership of Ukraine enhances the prospects of achieving a sustainable political Dniester region settlement A plenary meeting was held in Brussels on May 19 to sum up the work done in the ninth round of negotiations on a New Russia EU Framework Agreement The parties were generally appreciative of the current negotiation phase in terms of the momentum and the overall focus on the result, which should fully reflect the interests of both Russia and the EU Evaluation of the talks on the Framework Agreement is included in the agenda of the Russia EU summit at Rostov on Don (31 May¬† 1 June) It was arranged to hold the next, tenth round of negotiations in June and July This year's economic forum in St Petersburg will be held on June 17 19 Its keynote theme will be modernization: how Russia and other countries are going to seize the opportunities that the crisis has provided for the modernization of national and world economies By tradition, the President of the Russian Federation will open the forum with his speech French President Nicolas Sarkozy is scheduled to speak on the second day of the forum The discussions will involve the leaders of the world's largest companies, leading experts and heads of bodies of state power in Russia and other countries To date, participation has been confirmed by heads of companies in the most diverse industries: energy, manufacturing, high technology, the financial sector and consulting Among them: Total, BP, ENI, Shlumberger, BHP Bilton, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Alcoa, Daimler AG, Siemens, Intel, Cisco, Telenor, Nestle, Unilever and others, and the leaders of all major auditing firms Topics of panel discussions are devoted to the global problems of the world economy, the Russian specificity, as well as analysis of the future in the sphere of high technology in terms of its impact on the economy and business There will be held discussions on the most diverse themes ranging from changes in investment policy for the largest sovereign funds and the future of the markets for telecommunications and alternative energy, to new models of the formation and construction of the cultural environment of cities A number of sector specific discussions will be held as business lunches This year they will be devoted inter alia to the pharmaceutical industry and global market audit The Business Dialogues: Russia USA, Russia CIS, Russia European Union, and Russia India are organized Traditionally the heads the world's largest energy companies will meet in a panel discussion This year it will focus on the future of the global gas market For a discussion of the Russian theme, some of the activities of the forum will be held in a fundamentally new format briefings this year During the briefings, Cabinet members and leading experts will interact with the audience, explaining the changes that take place in Russia as part of the construction of the Customs Union and improvements in immigration and budgetary policies There was a question from Channel One: How does Moscow evaluate the dialogue with the United States on adoption, including the outcome of the meeting of the Russian US working group on the question of concluding a treaty governing international adoption? ùWe believe that the dialogue on issues of adoption is proceeding in a constructive manner There have been two rounds of consultation (on April 29 and May 12 14), a joint working group of experts has been set up and has already begun to harmonize the provisions of the draft bilateral adoption agreement submitted by the Russian side Most important, the parties have managed to reach a common understanding of the need to change the status quo in this area by adopting a legally binding treaty, which would reliably guarantee the rights, life and health of foster children It is about the regulation of adoption agencies, guarantees of free consular access to foster families, the preservation of the original nationality of children, and the determination in Russia and the US of central authorities responsible for the implementation of a future agreement The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education and Science and other concerned Russian agencies proceed from the assumption that it should be prepared as soon as possible This approach is shared by the American experts It was arranged to hold the next round of consultations in Washington in the first half of June In view of the media inquiries coming in to the Ministry, I would like to comment on the steps being taken to resolve the case ù of B T Hobert, a former school teacher at the German Embassy, who became responsible for the road traffic accident in Moscow on November 30, 2008, which killed two Russian citizens: A V Yevteyev and A G Kamynin On April 30, O E Kamynina, mother of Aleksandr Kamynin who died in the accident, forwarded an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the decision of Germany s Munster Court of November 10, 2009, giving Hobert a one year suspended sentence, a ban on driving for one month and a fine of 5,000 euros The lawsuit aims to ensure the injured parties' rights to a fair and public hearing and to life under Articles 6 and 2 of the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of November 4, 1950 The injured parties used the opportunity and their inalienable right of recourse to international courts due to the fact that the verdict of the Munster court is final and cannot be appealed within the framework of the legal system of Germany The German Federal Office of Justice had formally notified the Russian Prosecutor General's Office of this in response to its inquiry We believe that the ECHR s consideration of the Hobert case ù does not encompass another important aspect of a just settlement of the consequences of this tragic incident: reasonably compensating the victims' families for moral damage We want this solved in the spirit of a humanitarian gesture ù of the German side, in line with the understanding reached by Sergey Lavrov with German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the talks in Moscow on November 20, 2009, and confirmed at the meeting in Berlin on February 5 this year The initiative of German insurance company Allianz, which has insured Hobert s auto civil liability, to resolve the issue of compensation out of court by negotiating an amicable agreement ù with the families affected is being considered in this context The Russian Foreign Ministry will continue to work through diplomatic channels to provide the bereaved families with necessary assistance for a quick finalization with the German side of the acceptable to them and fair terms of an amicable agreement ù on compensation, which would fully take into account the humanitarian aspect of the question We intend to continue to keep you informed about the further development of this situation RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021

"19 May, 2010",Does America consider Russia friend or foe? Antimissile system will show,"Washington and NATO have recently declared the intention of enhancing their partnership with Russia, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the saying goes, not in the promises The reset ù of relations between the United States and Russia increasingly resembles a backroom card game, where the players are trying to read each other s cards and gain an advantage however possible Indeed, it is all too easy to imagine a smoky casino hall, rigged with secret mirrors and contraptions for delivering an ace from the sleeve This is unfortunate, and potentially tragic, because what the players are gambling with is the very life of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which is now being heatedly debated on the Senate floor The new START treaty, signed by Presidents Medvedev and Obama on April 8, 2010, promises to slash the nuclear stockpiles of the respective countries by 33 per cent, limiting the number of operationally deployed nuclear warheads to 1,550, while also reducing the number of ICBM launch vehicles and platforms to 800 Granted, there still exists the possibility of destroying the planet about 500 times, but, as the name of treaty suggests, it is a start This historic document, which presumes to make the world a far less volatile place, hinges on several factors as far as the US Republicans are concerned: the downsized nuclear arsenal must receive a multi billion dollar makeover (in order to understand the mentality of the modern American Republican, which is anything but conservative, it is merely necessary to follow the money scent) As far as I m concerned, ùSen Jon Kyle (Ariz ), a leading Republican spokesman on the treaty, told an audience at the National Defense University, it s got to be an absolute commitment to adequate funding for everything that has to be done (Last week, the White House released a summary report showing that spending on the modernization of the nuclear weapons complex over the decade will hit $80 billion, increasing from $6 4 billion this year to $7 billion in coming years and eventually topping $8 billion beginning in 2016 An additional $100 billion will go into strategic nuclear delivery systems, including bombers and land and sea based intercontinental ballistic missiles So Joe Taxpayer is mistaken if he thought the START treaty reductions would somehow translate into less money for the military industrial complex) But more to the point, US lawmakers are also demanding that START not interfere with the Bush administration s antimissile brainchild in Eastern Europe, practically on Russia s doorstep, for the ostensible purpose of shooting down rogue nation missiles Moscow has threatened to pull out of the treaty if the system threatens Russia s security Speaking at a session of the Russian State Duma on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov touted the treaty, which he said helps to maintain nuclear parity between Russia and the United States Lavrov went on to warn, however, that the new START pact, which allows Washington to develop its missile defense system, should not do so at the expense of Russia s national security (The State Duma plans to start debating the ratification of the updated START Treaty in the coming days) At yesterday s Senate hearing, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates sought to deflect criticism from the Republicans that the agreement could undermine US plans for missile defense Nothing in the treaty will constrain our missile defense efforts, Clinton said The United States was not bound by Russia s opposition to missile defense and had declared plans to continue improving and deploying its missile defense systems, she added Republican Senator Bob Corker expressed skepticism at the remarks, arguing that Moscow had a different take of how America s determination to build missile defenses in Europe could affect, perhaps fatally, the treaty Shouldn t it trouble us that, before we ever get started, that each of the countries has a very different opinion of what we ve negotiated as it relates to missile defense, Corker ventured to ask Nonetheless, Gates seemed totally indifferent to Russia s position, arguing instead that Moscow has always objected to anti missile programs The defense secretary, who is a former CIA director, said the Russians have hated missile defense ever since the strategic arms talks began in 1969 And so the notion that this treaty has somehow focused this antagonism on the part of the Russians toward missile defense, all I would say is it s the latest chapter in a long line of Russian objections to our proceeding with missile defense, he said Gates then ventured a reason for Russia s opposition to the system as probably because we can afford it and they can t The secretary of defense then cited major funding in next year s budget to bolster US missile defense systems as proof that we are putting our money where our beliefs are Some might be tempted to say instead that the United States is putting their beliefs where the money is, ù especially when we consider that the budget for 2011 sets aside $19 9 billion for missile defense radars, interceptors and launch pads There are several disturbing things about Mr Gates blithe comment concerning Russia s inability to fund a missile defense system as a reason for ignoring Moscow s concerns First, let s assume that Gates is right and Russia, now awash in oil dollars, cannot afford to build its own antimissile system (incidentally, it should be noted that Moscow is surrounded by the A 135 anti ballistic missile system, which seems to counter Gates claim that Russians hate missile defense ù The only difference is that the Russian system is not being planted in America s backyard) Does this imply that the United States must do what Russia cannot or will not? In this case, the answer is no, because in lieu of missile defense, Russia can certainly afford to go on building nuclear warheads like there s no tomorrow, as well as highly sophisticated delivery systems But apparently Gates refuses to gaze this far down the road, or perhaps believes that another arms race is not such a bad thing After all, it would just mean more dollars for his friends in the defense industry Second, Gates comments do not jibe with NATO s blueprint for change, hatched by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her Wise Men team of experts In that document, which will be the basis for NATO s new mission statement due out in November, it is stated that, Missile defense is most effective when it is a joint enterprise and co operation between the alliance and its partners especially Russia is highly desirable ù Meanwhile, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Secretary General of North Atlantic Treaty Organization, told reporters at a news conference that We are faced with a real threat and we need real protection against a real threat, and to that end we need an effective missile defense system which covers all populations in all allied nations ù But still, as hopeful sounding as the above statements may be, nothing definite has been mentioned as to how Russia will co operate with the United States and NATO on the anti missile system, planned to be operational in Bulgaria and Romania by 2015 Will Russian scientists be given the right to work on this project side by side with their American and European counterparts, or does joint enterprise and co operation ùmean something entirely different? Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov told reporters on Tuesday that that the level of co operation with the United States on missile defense must include all aspects of the ambitious project Co operation needs to be from A to Z: to the end, ùIvanov said, adding, We will assess the threats together, evaluate the risks together, and begin creating a defense system together ù Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) in April that Moscow advises that the system of global missile defense must protect not only a definite country or a group of countries, but also function in the interests of all responsible participants of international society He said Russia is opposed to the formation of air defense systems because they eventually damage the current balanced system between the main nuclear powers ù Either we are together or [Russia] will have to react somehow, ùhe said In closing this article, it may be interesting to consider a totally opposite side of the debate that is seldom heard: Is a nuclear free world, which is the stated goal of President Obama, more geopolitical smoke and mirrors than a rendering of the famous I have a dream ù speech? In other words, does Washington really believe that a nuclear free world, as wonderful as that may sound, is possible or even desirable? Although at first it may sound strange, many people think that such a dream is not only impossible; it is actually dangerous The reasons are worth consideration But the actual achievement of a world without nuclear weapons would be dangerous, ùwrote Gideon Rachman in the Financial Times [ A nuclear free world? No thanks, ù May 4, 2010] Nobody can prove that it is nuclear weapons that have kept the peace among the world s main powers since 1945 But the likeliest explanation is that conflict between nuclear armed states is just too dangerous to consider ù Rachman s conclusion, which was the cornerstone of the mutually assured destruction ù theory for many decades (until the United States abrogated the ABM Treaty in 2003), is terribly simple, yet possibly the only thing that has kept mankind from unleashing hell on earth: The balance of terror works ùIn fact, it is interesting to note that the only time nuclear weapons were used against an enemy happened when only one country had access to these frightening technologies Now the United States is set on unsettling that grim balance with an anti missile system smack in the heart of the most geopolitically sensitive real estate on the planet Hopefully it will do so with the help of Russia Otherwise, we are possibly in for what future historians (I am being perhaps overly optimistic that there will be some such individuals to record our folly) may very well label Cuban Missile Crisis II ù Do the right thing, NATO, and get Russia on board the antimissile defense system one hundred and ten per cent Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/america-russia-friend-foe/
"13 May, 2010",Obama submits START treaty to Congress,"US President Barack Obama has submitted to Congress the new Russia US START treaty aimed at cutting nuclear arsenals for ratification The signing of the document has been dubbed the final end to the Cold War ù On Thursday morning president Obama informed Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev over the phone that he had sent the document to the Senate In a message to the upper house of Congress, Obama urged the senators to ratify the document, saying it will enhance the national security of the United States ù It mandates mutual reductions and limitations on the world s two largest nuclear arsenals The Treaty will promote transparency and predictability in the strategic relationship between the United States and the Russian Federation and will enable each Party to verify that the other Party is complying with its obligations through a regime that includes on site inspections, notifications, a comprehensive and continuing exchange of data regarding strategic offensive arms, and provisions for the use of national technical means of verification, ùhis letter, published by the White House, reads On the same day, the Kremlin vowed to submit the document to Russia s State Duma shortly The Russian president will submit START for ratification in the next few days, ùPresidential Press Secretary Natalya Timakova said as quoted by Interfax news agency The ratification in the US Senate will require two thirds of the votes According to the White House official website, next week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will open formal hearings on the treaty, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mullen scheduled to testify Over the coming weeks, the Committee is likely to hold several hearings with other Administration witnesses, as well as with former officials from both Democratic and Republican Administrations Two other Senate committees Armed Services and Intelligence will also hold hearings on the Treaty, ùthe White House blog post reads Presidents Medvedev and Obamasigned the new START agreement on April 8 in Prague Over a period of seven years, the sides intend to cut the total amount of nuclear warheads by a third compared to the 2002 treaty and reduce by almost half the number of delivery vehicles The signing of the document is seen by both Moscow and Washington as a crucial step to a nuclear free world According to the joint statement issued on Thursday by the US and Russian delegations, The Treaty ushers in the transition to a higher level of cooperation between Russia and the US with respect to disarmament and non proliferation ù It lays the foundation for qualitatively new bilateral relations in the strategic military field and, in effect, marks the final end of the Cold War period We expect that the signing and entry into force of the new START Treaty will pave the way for an increasingly productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Russia and the US concerning the most relevant issues on the global agenda, ùit reads However, John Isaacs, from the Washington based Center for Arms Control and Non Proliferation, says that the treaty could cause serious debate in Congress There are several problems facing the treaty in the United States The most particular one is that there has been a very bitter competition between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the US Senate With the US elections coming up in November this year, a lot of Republicans are determined to prevent any more victories for President Obama, ùsaid Isaacs Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Aleksey Arbatov agrees that the ratification process will not be easy However, the document will be signed If nothing untoward happens in international politics for instance, an aggravation in the Iranian crisis, the US Senate could quietly ratify the new treaty by Christmas, and it could do so with an overwhelming majority of votes, ùhe said in an interview with Interfax Meanwhile, both presidents are determined not to allow the situation in Iran to worsen and are set to finally find common ground on the Iranian nuclear program issue While speaking over the phone on Thursday, the two agreed to intensify efforts aimed at finalizing the work to negotiate a common position within the sextet on Iran ù Medvedev and Obama have agreed to speed up the joint work aimed at helping to bring stability to the Middle East That, according to the Kremlin, will include studying nonstandard methods of approach to the situation in the region ù   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/start-treaty-submitted-congress/
"14 Apr, 2010",Medvedev calls Washington nuclear summit ‚Äúa total success‚Äù,"Following the nuclear security summit in Washington on Tuesday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was invited to speak at the Brookings Institute, Washington s oldest think tank Medvedev was introduced to the audience by Strobe Talbott, the president of the Brookings Institute, who lent his expertise to the US government as a Sovietologist ù during the collapse of the Soviet Union The Russian president opened his remarks by lauding the nuclear security summit, which brought together the leaders of 47 countries, as absolutely timely ù and a total success ù Indeed, just hours before, US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed a much delayed agreement on the disposal of tons of plutonium left over from Cold War era weapons The agreement binds each country to dispose of at least 34 tons of plutonium by using it as fuel in civilian power reactors to produce electricity by the year 2018; a monitoring regime will ensure against cheating Clinton said during a briefing ahead of the signing that a framework would be put in place to ensure that this material will never again be used for weapons or any other military purpose ù Lavrov said the signing was of very significant importance ù It s certainly a step in the direction of our shared goal of nuclear disarmament, ùhe added Incidentally, it is estimated that the combined 68 tons of US and Russian plutonium represents enough stocks for about 17,000 nuclear weapons Medvedev summed up his opinion of the summit by saying: I cannot recall a more trouble free summit when the participants were so unanimous in the assessment of the current situation It is not like discussing the economy, or talking about getting over the global crisis, it is nonetheless something that serves a real challenge and a real threat for any state taking part in the summit ù The Russian president went on to stress the importance of nations working together in sync to solve the problem of global nuclear proliferation This level of high cooperation was illustrated last week in Prague, where Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev renewed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) The issues of disarmament and nonproliferation concern a big number of countries and today s discussion confirmed it, ùMedvedev said The world will be harmonious only when its constituent parts complement one another instead of clashing with each other ù Although Medvedev was very enthusiastic about the progress that his country and the United States have made recently in the realm of nuclear proliferation, he expressed his hope that bilateral relations between the two nuclear powers were not confined to just nuclear issues It is important, in my opinion, that our relationship not be reduced to just nuclear cooperation, or to the limitation of strategic arms, though it is something that people expect of us, and we have assumed a big responsibility toward the international community I would like us to have a much broader cooperation in all the other areas ù But President Medvedev s comments on international cooperation were not just directed at nuclear security, but were instead meant to provide a set of international guidelines for addressing other issues, for example, building democracy, human rights and a market economy ù At this point, after acknowledging the positive changes that have occurred in US Russian relations over the last year, Medvedev took an opportunity to stress that it is important to recognize the uniqueness of each country s traditions, and how they may effect or determine the course that is taken in both the domestic and international spheres We have very different histories, and therefore sometimes we see things in different ways, ùhe began The US has been developing its market economy for two centuries already, while our country in the twentieth century has gone through a sequence of economic and political experiments and ordeals and that is why Russia needs several decades to gradually build an efficiently working political and economic system ù President Medvedev then hinted that the United States does not need to teach Russia a mature country steeped in its own centuries old traditions how to live There is no need for us to try to teach each other how to live well, ùhe said We should communicate on a regular basis in an honest manner, being absolutely frank ù Medvedev may have been referring to the United States plans to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, a move that may have disastrous consequences on the US Russian reset In order for such a system to be acceptable by Russia, there will ned to be, short of Russia s hands on participation in the project, a high level of trust between Moscow and Washington He then alluded to Russia s rich traditions that sometime hinder modernization, but sometimes also protect society We

Russian president then took an opportunity to say a few words on behalf of democracy to his hosts Declaring the principles of democracy is not what is needed, ùMedvedev said This is not enough What is important is that we exercise the principles of democracy Practice is the criterion of truth ù In the Q&A part of Medvedev s presentation, Rick Burt, the US chairman of Global Zero, an international organization that works for the elimination of nuclear weapons, asked the Russian president if there would be a new round of meetings to further cut nuclear stockpiles between the US and Russia If one day we are able to achieve global zero that will be due not to just to the efforts of the United States and Russia, but to the international community I will not point fingers, but we have partners

"8 Apr, 2010",Will US Republicans shoot down START treaty?,"President Barack Obama, on a political roll after passing his healthcare reform legislation, is set to face severe Senate scrutiny over his administration s arms reduction treaty with Russia Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev met in Prague on Thursdayto sign the successor to the1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty The long fought document commits both nations to slashing the number of strategic nuclear warheadsby one third, and more than halving the number of missiles, and the submarines and bombers carrying them While the atmosphere in the Czech Republic following the signing ceremony was one of jubilation, back on Main Street, USA the enthusiasm is much more muted as the Republicans search for ways to paint the treaty as a threat to US security The partisan battle over the American president s new nuclear initiative was best captured by Fox News during its coverage of Obama s departure for Prague, the chosen venue for the historic signing between the two former cold war foes President Obama heading for the Czech Republic as we speak, ùstarted the Fox anchor, who spoke as if she were reporting on the sinking of the Titanic Set to sign a new nuclear pact with Russia Now critics are asking: Will the new deal leave the US defenseless until it s too late? ù This is exactly the sort of argument that many members of the US Senate, most of them from the Republican Party, will be making in an effort to derail Obama s ongoing efforts to reset ù relations with Moscow, which many political pundits continue to associate with the defunct Soviet Union, as opposed to the capital of a modern and democratic Russian Federation It is important to remember in this context that Obama s Democrats enjoy a robust majority † but not the required 67, or two thirds, vote necessary to seal the deal without Republican support Stephen Rademaker, former head of the State Department s arms control bureau, suggested that some US senators might cast their vote against the treaty since the Russians, according to him, intend to use it as leverage to stop US missile defense initiatives already declared by Obama Is there an intention on both sides to live with this treaty, or are the Russians essentially coming to this wedding declaring that they want to get married but they don t intend to live in holy matrimony? Rademaker asked during a forum at the Heritage Foundation in Washington this week, as reported by Reuters The treaty does not contain any constraints on testing, development or deployment of current or planned US missile defense programs or current or planned United States long range conventional strike capabilities, according to a White House statement Once signed and submitted, the new treaty can expect close scrutiny by the Senate, ùwrote Strobe Talbott, the former US Deputy of State under the Clinton administration and president of the Brookings Institution Since the agreement affects vital US security interests, it should receive nothing less ù But Talbott seems confident that the Senate will conclude that the Treaty does not compromise America s security interests A final judgment will have to wait until we see the detailed treaty provisions, ù Talbott continued But based on what we know to date, the treaty will deserve to pass the merit test in the Senate ù The Republicans seem to understand that it would be politically risky to voice too many objections to the START treaty, especially when they are beginning to require a reputation as the just say no ù party Thus, they have decided instead to take up arms against Obama s revised Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released Tuesday, two days before the START signing The White House s revised nuclear doctrine states that the US commits itself to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in deterring non nuclear attacks ùThe new enemy friendly approach applies to states that are party to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and in compliance with their nuclear non proliferation obligations ùClearly, this is a thinly veiled allusion to North Korea and Iran to get on board the NPT, or face international sanctions † or worse Still, some Republican (and neoconservative) commentators say Obama s new nuclear strategy weakens America s defenses Charles Krauthammer, a Washington Post columnist, whom the Financial Times in 2006 called the most influential commentator in America ù,provided a completely misleading assessment of Obama s nuclear doctrine in an interview with Fox News In the event of a biological attack on the United States, Krauthammer said the White House lawyers would ascertain if that country is in compliance with the NPT and if it is it gets immunity from a massive nuclear retaliation ù He then suggests that the Obama administration, if it found itself in such a situation [biological attack from a nation that complies with the NPT regime], would be forced to resort to TNT and marines shooting guns, ùa non apocalyptic scenario that he somehow finds insane or ridiculous ù Although it seems beyond doubt that the Russian Duma will give its legislative blessing to the treaty, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week said that Moscow reserves the right to withdraw from the new START treaty if US missile defense threatens Russia s national security The Russian Federation will have the right to withdraw from the (new) treaty if the quantitative and qualitative growth of the potential of the US strategic anti missile defense starts exerting substantial influence on the efficiency of the Russian strategic nuclear forces, ùLavrov told reporters on Tuesday It goes without saying that we ourselves will determine the degree of this influence Although Obama s Nuclear Posture Review has no bearing on the START treaty, Republicans are using it to suggest that Obama is exposing the United States to outside threats The same ridiculous argument continues to be forwarded whenever his administration attempts to try the detainees of Guantanamo Bay in US civilian courts as opposed to closed door military tribunals, which only suggests that the Bush administration has much to lose if the terrorists ù are permitted to speak their minds in an open court But that s another story In the final analysis, the US Republicans are acutely aware that Obama has made nuclear non proliferation one of the pillars of his presidency, and in the spirit of American political games, the games will certainly continue With mid term elections just around the corner, the Republicans will ramp up the rhetoric that Obama is weakening the nation s resolve before a resurgent Russia ù But it was exactly such tired, worn out clich√©s that helped Obama win the White House in the first place The Republicans will have to do much better than mere fear mongering if they hope to derail START in the Senate Robert Bridge, RT Read also † New START Treaty Triggers Development of Non Nuclear Arms   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/republicans-shoot-down-start/
"7 Apr, 2010",START: trust me like I trust you,"Final preparations are being made for the signing of the historic nuclear disarmament pact START between Russia and the US in Prague on Thursday, April 8 One of the main hopes is that it will encourage other nations with nuclear weapons to reduce their arsenals as well the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades After months of debate and negotiations it seems that the wait is over and on Thursday Presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama will put pen to paper and formalize a new START treaty The United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades, ùObama announced At the height of the Cold War it was estimated there were nearly 40,000 nuclear warheads deployed worldwide The original START treaty, signed in 1991, aimed at reducing the arsenals of the US and the USSR to 6,000 each Read START I treaty (full text) START I expired last December, and since then, the world has been looking to the two nuclear superpowers to take the next step The new agreement plans an unprecedented reduction to only 1,500 warheads each, a move that some hope will be an example to the remaining nuclear powers an important step in the direction of making the world safer I think the signing of this treaty is very important and I have no doubt that it will be an important step in the direction of making the world safer It will be the beginning of a process in which the diminishing of nuclear weapons will continue, ùnoted Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief from 1999 2009 an important step in the direction of making the world safer In the past much of the focus of the START treaty has been on reducing delivery systems, but now there is a new twist in the START agreement linking strategic missile offense to defense The legal juridical linkage in the text of the treaty means that in case the US does something unilateral in order to strengthen their defensive potential † increase the number of interceptors, introduce other radar stations somewhere nearby and so on and so forth in case they improve their defensive capacity, that would mean that the balance has been damaged and that Russia has a legal right to get out of this treaty again and to take some additional measures to compensate for that unilateral development, ùclarified Konstantin Kosachev, the head of Russia s State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee What s new about START? Russian FM puts a word in The idea of an American missile defense shield in Russia s back yard has been one of the key points of contention in the new start agreement, but by connecting offensive and defensive capabilities it seems a compromise has been reached that can make both countries happy The first stages deal with regional defense systems which don t damage regional stability and don t pose any threat to Russia s strategic forces, ùexplained Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov If and when our monitoring of how those plans are implemented shows they are entering a stage of creating strategic missile defense systems, and our military experts interpret this as posing a threat to Russia s strategic forces, we will have the right to resort to provisions provided in this treaty ù A treaty billed as a new start between two countries paving the way for a future that could see a world free of the threat of nuclear war Russia s deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov, told RT the new treaty reflects a different level of trust between the two nations control but trust this is the essence of the philosophy implemented in this treaty Control but trust this is the essence of the philosophy in the area of verification which was implemented in this treaty We have a leaner, a more effective treaty, less heavy in terms of bureaucratic intricacies and more built upon a mutual trust, really acquired by the parties over the years since the Cold War ended, ùSergey Ryabkov stated control but trust this is the essence of the philosophy implemented in this treaty We have a system of verification that will allow us to check when it is necessary to do so to be sure that nothing goes undetected, but at the same time we have never intended to build a system even closer to the one that was in place when the Cold War type of relationship dominated our arms control agreements with the US, ùhe concluded Viktor Kamyshanov from the Federation of Peace and Conciliation believes the signing of the new START treaty is a good sign that the two major powers with nuclear armaments have come to the decision that they have to be leaders in this process ù He added that the fact that Russia and the US decided to limit their nuclear arsenals is a sign that nuclear weapons are not the means of the solution of international dispute ù Sergey Strokan, political analyst from Kommersant Newspaper, shares this point of view, saying that this treaty is not only about nuclear warheads, it is not only about the verification process † this is about the role of nuclear weapons in the world ù He also observed that by signing this treaty, Russia and US would show that nuclear weapons are becoming outdated ù With the START treaty, Russia and the US will have more moral right ù and international public opinion on their side, told RT Professor Evgeny Bazhanov, the vice president of Russia s Diplomatic Academy This will help to convince other countries with existing or planned nuclear capabilities to change their nuclear policies and slash nuclear arsenals Russia and America are interested for those countries not to have nuclear weapons and we will do our best to convince them not to do it, ùsaid the diplomat Mikhail Troitsky, a political analyst from the Macarthur Foundation, believes the new START treaty is an important milestone which gives further momentum for both sides to engage on other substantive issues ù Meanwhile President Barack Obama has unveiled a new American nuclear policy, ahead of signing the START treaty Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates explained that it would narrow down the circumstances under which the US would use nuclear arms But the President warned that countries breaking international rules would remain potential targets   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/start-trust-treaty-conditions/
"12 Mar, 2010",ROAR: Russia-US reset ‚Äúneeds urgent resetting‚Äù,"Moscow and Washington should sign a new START treaty by April 12, otherwise it will be a complete fiasco, ù analysts warn The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit Moscow on March 18 19 for talks on the newnuclear arms reduction treaty She will also attend a meeting of the quartet of international mediators in Israeli Palestinian peace talks Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will discuss issues concerning efforts in the direction of non proliferation in the context of the April 12 13 nuclear security global summit in Washington If the new strategic arms reduction treaty is not signed by that date, it will seriously hamper the reset of Russian US relations, many observers warn Moscow and Washington have offered different predictions regarding the perspectives of the signing of the new treaty on strategic offensive arms reduction, ùKommersant daily said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently sounded optimistic, saying that the treaty may be signed in the next two or three weeks ùthe paper said However, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said no deadlines should be set for the signing, ùand, if needed, it would be approved after the April 12 13 nuclear security conference in Washington, the daily noted Unofficially, negotiators say that almost everything has been agreed in the document except the link between offensive and defensive weapons, or missile defense, ùKommersant said Russia and the US seemed to have agreed that the link should be reflected in the treaty, but Washington then backed out, a source close to the Geneva talks told the daily Moscow wants this link to be binding, the source said, adding that it may be reflected in an attachment to the document Another source of the paper in the Russian Foreign Ministry described as inappropriate ù the agreement between the US andRomaniathat had been announced recently In February, Romania and Bulgaria declared their intention to participate in the US missile defense program and confirmed that the talks are already underway Moscow and Washington agreed on the treaty s clause regarding the exchange of telemetric data, and Russia will provide its partner with information about only a limited number of missile launches, the paper said However, the formal linkage between strategic arms cuts and missile shield remains a sticking point If the link between defensive and offensive arm is fixed in the treaty, it may accelerate the ratification of the document when it is signed by the presidents The more detailed is this link, the easier it will pass the State Duma, ùKonstantin Kosachev, head of the parliament s Foreign Affairs Committee, told Kommersant Otherwise, the document will not be ratified by the State Duma, Kosachev said But the problem is that the US lawmakers are not likely to approve the treaty containing this link either, analysts believe Another round of talks on the START treaty that began on March 9 in Geneva can be considered decisive ù, observer Vadim Yelfimov said Many observers hastened to call it the last round, probably meaning that the document is almost ready, ù he said in a commentary for Regnum news agency But haste may be dangerous ù in the issues concerning national security, the observer noted, adding that Russia should demonstrate that it will never make unilateral concessions ù A realistic treaty ù should not proceed from the fact that the US is abandoning its missile program immediately, but it should create conditions for that, ùthe observer said The linkage between the START treaty and dynamics of missile defense is not only logical in military terms, it is necessary from a political point of view, because a normal cooperation between the two super powers will always be on the agenda, ùYelfimov noted Moscow has slowed down talks on the START treaty to demonstrate its discontent about Washington s plans to deploy missile shield, ùNezavisimaya Gazeta daily said Analysts agree that this has become the main stumbling block Russia is displeased with Washington, which has taken a unilateral decision to deploy a tactical missile system in southern Europe without consulting Russia, ùAleksey Arbatov, director of the Center for International Security at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences , told the daily The plans of deploying missile shield in Romania and Bulgaria have been probably adopted outside the framework of the Russian US mechanism of mutual assessments of threats, which should have already started working, the analyst said At the same time, Arbatov has no doubts that the treaty on arms cuts will be signed anyway ù Moscow possibly expects a number of political steps from Washington, the daily said The US should confirm that it will not act unilaterally ùand is ready to assess threats jointly with Moscow, the paper added Russia also wants its partners to take the decisions on deploying a missile shield based on reports made by both parties assessing the threats, the paper said Moscow also expects the US to be ready to discuss the issues of missile defense during talks in the future, after the signing of the new START treaty, it added The pact itself should be signed by 12 April when the nuclear security summit starts, Arbatov believes Otherwise, it would be a complete fiasco, ùhe said, adding that in this case it would be senseless to speak about any nuclear disarmament or resetting relations ù Hillary Clinton will arrive in Moscow next week to reset relations that have already been reset, ùRossiyskaya Gazeta daily said The talks will be difficult as the Russian US relations have already started to stumble again, ùthe paper predicts The majority of analysts described the first meetings between President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev as encouraging, ù the daily said It seemed that Washington was ready for a serious breakthrough, but everything proved to be more modest, ùit noted Now there is no doubt that the reset itself needs urgent resetting, ùthe daily stressed In particular, the parties repeatedly said in autumn last year that the text of the new arms reduction treaty would be agreed on by December 5, 2009 when the START 1 expired, ùit said But only by January this year was the treaty 98 per cent ready, ùthe daily said, adding that the countries cannot accomplish the remaining two per cent ùMoscow had to react to the unilateral activities of the US in the missile defense sphere at the very least because the presidents of Russia and the US agreed to mutually assess threats first, and then decide where and

Konstantin Kosachev: We are in a very interesting period of our relations, between Russia and the United States And there are many initiatives and proposals coming from each side, including the latest comments by Hillary Clinton Sometimes these comments go in line with our own ideas and proposals; sometimes they contradict our vision of the current situation and our expectations about the future I believe that the most interesting part of it they ve reached so far in our relations during the period Mr Obama and Ms Clinton is that we have established this mechanism, infrastructure for our discussion in different areas like security, trade and economy, humanitarian issues and all others And this means that sooner or later we will be able to work out common understanding, common evaluations about, let s say, common threats and challenges in the field of security and whether we will create a different security structure for Europe † I do not know I believe that Europe needs it, because the current structures, NATO included, are not efficient enough Not a single security structure in Europe † neither NATO, nor OSCE, no other organization managed to prevent the conflict in Georgia, for example, or the previous conflict in Kosovo, for example So, we need to do it in a different way, this is number one And we need to do it through joint efforts † this is number two But for that we need to evaluate our problems, threats and challenges on the bilateral basis, on the multilateral basis And this is what we ve started to do, and hopefully, we ll reach some final result in the nearest future RT: You know, US China relations seem to be growing more and more tense, whether it has to do with trade issues, or cyber warfare, or arms sales to Taiwan So is the United States essentially looking to serve support to another country, perhaps, maybe Russia now more than ever? KK: Well, we watch the current developments in relations between the States and China And we definitely are not going to interfere, or to make comments on that This is a clear bilateral issue for the United States and China And I believe that is equally wrong to believe that Russia plays games ù with China in order to tease Americans, or Americans would try to play games with Russia in order to tease China This is rather na√Øve, this is too much simplifying things I believe that we all need each other China is a real player, Russia is a real player, the European Union is a real player, and of course the United States is a real player And we do not have many options Either we learn how to co operate with each other without concentrating on contradictions and problems in our relations We have many problems in the relations between Russia and the States, as many problems as the States has with China, for example But either we learn not to concentrate on the problems and contradictions and we make progress in the areas where our interests coincide, or we will all the time be trapped in these contradictions and problems without any sufficient result, which is completely wrong RT: When we look at this START treaty What are the major sticking problems here? Because it seems like we are missing deadline after deadline And the negotiation process is a lot more complicated than many people anticipated it would be Why is that and when can we expect a new treaty? KK: Number one is quite simple: there should not be any deadlines when we have a negotiation process, because what is important is a good result of these negotiations It s about two serious things † it s about national security, it s about strategic balance and it s about possible further possible developments for other nuclear powers to join this process at a later stage So, these are very serious things we speak about And the sooner the better, definitely But in case we need more time, it is much better to spend this time on further negotiations, rather than to work out a text that will not be sustainable enough As far as I can see, we have just a couple of problems to be solved before the final result is reached, and the major problem is of course about the linkage between a strategic offensive and strategic defensive forces, between anti missile systems in Europe, to put it the right way and strategic armaments Americans, as far as I can see, would prefer to avoid any restraints, any limits in that area They want to develop their national and multinational missile systems without any agreements with Russia or any other country This is absolutely unacceptable for us We cannot imagine a situation where we can continue to disarm, continue to cut down our strategic armaments without knowing exactly, what s going to happen in the field of anti missile systems So, we insist on this linkage, and we believe that this linkage should be legally written down, should be legally written down on paper in the coming agreement on strategic armaments And this disagreement continues to exist But I believe that they have come closer to each other and that their compromise is rather close RT: Speaking of the nuclear issue, it seems like Russia is getting closer and closer to the possibility of imposing sanctions on Iran Do you have any insight into that? Why the shift?KK: We are getting more and more concerned about what is going on in Iran with its nuclear program We have many questions and we do not get proper answers to them from the Iranian side And the most important thing is that the IAEA † the International Atomic Energy Agency † is getting more concerned This is their judgment that it should be important for Russia and for the United States and for everybody else, and we speak about how to react on that with our partners It may be sanctions It is not excluded at all What is excluded is the use of military force † nothing else is excluded It may be any other measures of setting additional pressure on Iran What is important is to show that the international community in this aspect is consolidated † that we are not separated, that we are not divided And we have come much closer in our approaches with our partners in this group And we hope that this is also the position of our Chinese colleagues Because the situation is bringing more and more concerns RT: Is China more likely to get on board if Russia takes this step?KK: I believe that in case they see that the international community is consolidated, they will not hesitate to join the international community This is my personal assessment RT: Could we get your take on the situation in Afghanistan and US efforts over there? You said before that you think that Russia and the United States should work together on restoring the Afghan economy Can you elaborate a bit on that?KK: The situation in Afghanistan is getting worse and worse, and one of the basic reasons for that is that people do not have any economic and social infrastructure to live on And this is how they are either joining the so called resistance movement, or start to deal with narcotics [production and trafficking] inside and outside of Afghanistan So, we need to provide an alternative, a real alternative to the civil population of Afghanistan And for that we need to assist with the restoration of the national economy of Afghanistan America and NATO countries who participate in this operation do not do anything about that Just nothing They combat Taliban, they try to solve the drug problem, but they do not provide any options And I believe that in case that we find formats suitable for Russia for further participation like money coming from, let s say the European Union or the United States and us, Russian companies [conducting work] inside Afghanistan, that could be a very interesting development RT: Any chance Russia would send forces or maybe even instructors? What Russia s role can be if any as far as manpower goes?KK: Any participation in the ongoing military operation in Afghanistan is absolutely excluded It is not possible and it is not discussible In case we send people to Afghanistan † that may take place only in terms of civil projects, in terms of restoring national economy of Afghanistan based on the agreements with the ruling Afghan authorities, definitely And this should be a question of further consultations, negotiations There are no decisions made This is my theoretical assessment that it can be possible, it can be done through joint efforts of Russia and other countries who are really interested in the peace process in this country RT: Speaking of the nuclear issue, it seems like Russia is getting closer and closer to the possibility of imposing sanctions on Iran Do you have any insight into that?

KK: Any participation in the ongoing military operation in Afghanistan is absolutely excluded It is not possible and it is not discussible In case we send people to Afghanistan † that may take place only in terms of civil projects, in terms of restoring national economy of Afghanistan based on the agreements with the ruling Afghan authorities, definitely And this should be a question of further consultations, negotiations There are no decisions made This is my theoretical assessment that it can be possible, it can be done through joint efforts of Russia and other countries who are really interested in the peace process in this country RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/russia-us-disarmament-kosachev/
"1 Mar, 2010",‚ÄúEuropean security architecture falls hostage to imaginary missile threats‚Äù,"Russia will continue to consistently oppose any dubious unilateral actions in the area of missile defense which may adversely affect international security, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Andrey Nesterenko In his weekly media address, Nesterenko commented on the deployment of US missile shield elements in Romania, Russia US relations, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton s visit to Moscow, the situation in Niger and START treaty development, as well as other issues RT presents the full transcript of Andrey Nesterenko s briefing, which took place on February 26, 2009 The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in Kyiv yesterday held the inauguration ceremony of the country s new President, Viktor Yanukovych Boris Gryzlov, Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, and Sergey Naryshkin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office, represented Russia at the ceremony I think you have been able to acquaint yourselves with their statements during the events in Kyiv on Russian Ukrainian relations and their prospects, which were widely cited by a number of media For my part, I can in addition quote the words of the head of the Russian foreign affairs ministry, Sergey Lavrov, from yesterday s interview with the chiefs of news agencies Voice of Russia, Russia Today and RIA Novosti: Despite the problems in our relationship, which are well known, we have every reason to move towards solving them based on mutual respect and a balance of interests of each other And we sense that desire on the Ukrainian side under President Yanukovych as well ù President Michel Sleiman of the Republic of Lebanon paid an official visit to the Russian Federation on February 24 26, as part of which he had talks with President Dmitry Medvedev in the Kremlin Sleiman also met with State Duma Chairman Boris Gryzlov and called on Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia and Chairman of the Russian Council of Muftis, Ravil Gainutdin This was the first visit of a head of the Lebanese state to our country in the 65 year history of diplomatic relations Both parties view it as an important and landmark event The Joint Statement adopted at the end of the summit, to develop further and strengthen the relationship of friendship and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Lebanon, set out the main thrust areas and prospects for multi faceted bilateral interaction Considerable attention was paid to reinvigorating trade and economic contacts and promoting investment projects Agreement was reached to activate the mechanisms of the Intergovernmental Economic and Trade Cooperation Commission and the Russian Lebanese Business Council for this purpose The sides touched upon themes of project development in the humanitarian sphere, which has traditionally played an important role in the system of bilateral ties They also discussed the prospects for promoting military technical cooperation between the two countries Issues of the regional and international agenda were substantively examined, particularly taking into account Lebanon s membership in the UN Security Council in 2010 2011 The central theme in this case was Middle East peace efforts toward achieving a just and comprehensive Middle East settlement which must include a full Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in June 1967, the establishment of an independent viable Palestinian state coexisting in peace and security with Israel and a just solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly of the United Nations The Russian side again expressed strong support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon, and the efforts of the Lebanese leadership to ensure internal stability and national reconciliation and to strengthen public institutions of the country It emphasized the inadmissibility of outside interference in Lebanese affairs The sides pointed out the need to implement all provisions of UN Security Council resolution 1701, including the preservation of tranquility on the Israeli Lebanese border area and an end to violations of Lebanon s airspace We are confident that the many sided development of Russian Lebanese relations, which received at the summit in Moscow a very strong impetus, works for stability in the Middle East Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov paid a working visit to the Republic of Kazakhstan from February 21 22 In Astana, Lavrov was received by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and held extensive talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs Kanat Saudabayev During his talks with the Kazakh leaders, held in a traditionally friendly and trustful atmosphere, a substantive exchange of views took place on key issues in bilateral relations and on a wide spectrum of problems on the international agenda The sides discussed the state of and prospects for Russian Kazakhstan cooperation in the political, economic and humanitarian fields in light of the latest agreements reached at the meetings between the presidents of the two countries Considerable attention was paid to practical steps to bolster cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan in economic and trade questions, in space, nuclear areas and in other fields The importance was confirmed by increasing efforts to effectively implement the Joint Action Plan between Russia and Kazakhstan for 2009 2010 In the context of the current Kazakh OSCE Chairmanship, agreement was reached on augmenting the interaction of the two countries in this Organization in dealing with pressing international and regional problems The parties also stressed the need for even closer coordination of efforts in the integration entities operating in the CIS space: CSTO, EurAsEC and SCO They paid special attention to practical issues relating to the creation of the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan The ministers thoroughly discussed stability and security in Central Asia, cooperation in the CICA and in fighting the common threats and challenges, the situation in Afghanistan, Caspian related themes and other issues The parties noted with satisfaction the steady and dynamic development of multifaceted Russian Kazakhstan relations, built on a solid foundation of friendship, mutual respect, good neighborliness, alliance and strategic partnership A delegation of the European Union, led by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton, stayed in Moscow on February 24 Let me recall that Ashton was elected to the post of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on 19 November 2009 and that on February 9, 2010 she was also approved as the First Vice President of the European Commission Catherine Ashton was received in the Kremlin by Dmitry Medvedev The President of Russia congratulated her on her appointment to the new position and expressed hope for a productive dialogue on cooperation between Russia and the European Union During the conversation in the Kremlin, special attention was paid to the need to increase the practical benefits of the strategic partnership and to define breakthrough and priority themes which will determine our agenda The talk was also about how to see that the first results of this work are achieved near the next Russia EU summit, to be held in Rostov on Don, 31 May 1 June this year As key areas for cooperation with the EU the President singled out, above all, the Modernization Partnership This concept had been discussed at the previous Russia EU summit in Stockholm Last autumn it was backed up, and now we have begun, with our EU partners, a practical conversation about filling this concept with specific content The first outlines of our partnership have been identified We want to prioritize concrete, practically important areas of cooperation that cover economic development, social services, education, science, technology, innovation, management, administration, and law enforcement On the same day, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held talks with the head of the EU delegation The parties discussed the range of Russia EU relations, the course of preparing a new Russia EU framework agreement, and steps to further strengthen cooperation in 2010 Attention was devoted to streamlining the formats of Russia EU cooperation in the context of the entry into force of the Lisbon Reform Treaty of the EU During the Kremlin conversation with the President and the talks at the Foreign Ministry Mansion, both sides paid special attention to further liberalization of the visa regime In this regard, good opportunities exist for additional steps to be taken under the already existing accords between Russia and the EU The Russian side raised the question of the need to concretize the long stated aim of moving towards a visa free regime We hope that the current consultations between Russian and EU experts on the substantive issues which in the EU s view must be resolved in order to move to a visa free regime and will soon be crowned with success so we will be able to talk about timing Russia, as you know, is ready to shift to a reciprocal visa free regime with the EU even tomorrow Also discussed were issues of interaction between Russia and the EU in international affairs, especially in crisis management The sides have a positive experience of cooperation, particularly in regard to the peacekeeping operations past and current in Chad and the Central African Republic, and with respect to anti piracy efforts The heads of the Russian and EU foreign affairs agencies examined European security issues in the light of the proposals of President Medvedev to craft a European Security Treaty They also had a thorough exchange of views on a number of topical aspects of international relations, including the Middle East settlement process, the situation in Afghanistan, Iran s nuclear program, and conditions in parts of Eastern Europe and Transcaucasia As you know, Russia in late December of last year put forward the proposal to hold a Quartet Ministerial meeting in Moscow We proceeded on the assumption that at this difficult time for the Middle East, with the dangerous pause in Israeli Palestinian negotiations dragging on for more than a year, it was important to prevent destabilization in the region and try to find a way to restore dialogue between the parties At such a moment, concerted efforts of the international community were especially needed All Quartet members backed up our proposal Vigorous efforts were made recently to coordinate the date for this event As you know from the statement of the Minister, the exact date is now agreed ì the 19th of March I can say that the Quartet s special representatives have already started working through all the issues so that the upcoming Moscow meeting becomes a contribution so necessary today to the restoration of the peace process in the region In addition to daily communication by telephone, they are also to meet with several partners I received the following question A year has passed since the Administration of Barack Obama declared a reset in the relations with Russia How could you assess the current state of bilateral relations? In this regard, I can say just this Russia has consistently championed normal relations with the United States, based on the principles of consideration of mutual interests, observance of the obligations assumed, honesty and predictability We never departed from this policy line and follow it also now during the work with the team of President Obama The results of the past year of interaction with the new American administration are seen by us as positive and encouraging We have made substantial progress in strengthening the trust and predictability in bilateral relations Constructive and productive is the Russian American dialogue at the highest level In the past year there were five meetings between the Presidents of Russia and the United States, including full fledged talks in Moscow in July 2009 which resulted in a number of important bilateral documents, including the Joint Understanding on the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms, and the joint statements on Afghanistan, on missile defense and on cooperation in the nuclear field The Presidential Commission for the development of cooperation was created, which has set up more than 15 working groups on various areas, thereby combining many and ramified contacts between our countries into a single, coherent mechanism The Commission is working on the basis of the Presidential Action Plan, which sets out the challenges and outlines the guidelines for the future By the end of last year the stage of forming the Commission and determining the general framework of its work was completed, and the parties proceeded to a full scale deployment of its activities through specialized teams to achieve specific mutually beneficial results Significant efforts are directed at concluding a new Russian US agreement on strategic arms Despite the shortness of time and a large number of military technical problems, we have been able to significantly move forward within the negotiation process and to prepare a voluminous package of documents that can form the basis for the further development of relations between Russia and the US in the strategic realm We hope that we manage to reach mutually acceptable solutions on outstanding issues in line with the national interests of both countries and to conclude the treaty soon Regarding interaction on the international scene, a vigorous bilateral dialogue is in progress on counter terrorism, Middle East settlement, Iran s nuclear program and a variety of other topics On many of these themes over the past year we have managed to reach a higher level of mutual understanding with the American partners Targeted efforts continue to expand economic and trade cooperation Even in a year of crisis, against the background of reduced bilateral trade and investment flows, we proceeded with implementing a whole array of new and very promising joint projects For example, the launch of the VSMPO Avisma/Boeing venture for the machining of titanium forgings, the construction in Russia of additional Alcoa and PepsiCo production facilities, and the active work in the Russian market of the agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere Cultural and humanitarian cooperation is being developed Performances of many Russian creative groups have become an integral part of the largest theater stages of America Exhibitions from collections of Russian museums cause rave reviews among American art lovers All this is a real contribution to enhancing mutual understanding between our peoples and societies, and that is the ultimate goal of the dialogue that takes place at the level of political leadership of both states So, in our opinion, the past year has shown that Russian US cooperation has good prospects Russia and the United States ought to seize the opportunities not only to correct, or, as our US colleagues put it, reset bilateral relations, but also to create a more favorable climate in the world which could help the search for answers to the dangerous threats and challenges of today and the promotion of stability and sustainable development at global and regional levels At the same time, looking at the future of Russian American relations, we, of course, remain realistic and judge things in a purely pragmatic way Much will depend on how strictly the principles of mutual respect and equality are observed in practice and how consistent the line on developing a constructive and mutually beneficial partnership is For our part, we are ready for that and expect the same from our US colleagues too We have noted the statements of official Bucharest on the deliberateness ù of its decision to host elements of a US global missile defense system on Romanian soil and the transparency ù purportedly shown by Americans in advancing these plans Romanian presidential adviser Iulian Fota, for example, made exactly this point in a recent media interview These statements are not quite correct Of course, we are concerned that of the critical decisions being made on a US antimissile presence in Europe we do not learn from our official partners in Washington or Bucharest, but from the media Such practice is out of line with our idea of equal partnership in the field of missile defense, but the problem lies elsewhere What s at issue is that we are again becoming witnesses to a hasty antimissile arrangement for Europe when the fragile architecture of European security actually falls hostage to imaginary missile threats that are defined unilaterally It should be noted that in accordance with the Russian American presidential statement on missile defense of July 6, 2009, we have only just begun a joint assessment of missile challenges Similar work, as you know, is being conducted within NATO In general, serious questions remain in our minds about the true purpose of the US missile defense system Therefore, we will continue to consistently oppose any dubious unilateral actions in the area of missile defense which may adversely affect international security I was asked the following question: How can you comment on reports about the agreement reached in the capital of Qatar between the government of Sudan and the Darfur rebel movement? ù As far as is known from reports that came in, a framework agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Sudanese government and one of the major opposition politico military groups in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement, was signed in Doha the other day Although the agreement reached through active mediation is interim and partial, it is seen as a substantial step forward in unblocking the political process Evidence for such importance was the attendance of the Emir of Qatar and the Presidents of Sudan, Chad and Eritrea at the signing ceremony Under this document both parties agreed firstly on an immediate ceasefire and secondly on the continuation of talks on the basis of the concerted principles for settlement with the aim of finishing them by mid March This meets the task set by official Khartoum of achieving peace and security in Darfur before a general election in Sudan in April this year It should be noted that simultaneously with this event in Doha came the announcement of a fusion of ten Darfur groups into a joint negotiation team, ù which of course makes it easier to forge dialogue But four groups represented in the Qatar capital remain outside this bloc, let alone the fact that such a large Darfur faction as the Sudan Liberation Movement of el Nur is still boycotting the Doha talks Russia, assisting international mediation in Darfur, proceeds from the assumption that there is no alternative to advancing the resumed negotiation process, commends the positive shifts, and hopes for its early finalization in the shape of a realizable all embracing peace agreement We will actively support efforts being made toward this end A military group carried out a coup d etat in Niger on February 18, arresting President Mamadou Tandja and government members The coup leaders, the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy (SCRD), have suspended the Constitution and halted the work of all state institutions in the country Its chairman, Salou Djibo, was declared the head of state and the head of government Instead of the dissolved Supreme Court, a State Court has been appointed and the Constitutional Court has been replaced with a Constitutional Committee On February 23 by his decree, Djibo appointed Mahamadou Danda the prime minister of the country The SCRD has assumed the functions of the legislative and executive branches, pledged to preserve national unity and equality before the law for all, and declared that it guarantees observance of personal rights and freedoms and restoration of the democratic process ù in the country It has also announced that Niger remains committed to the previously signed and ratified treaties and international agreements The military coup has caused a negative reaction in the international community Niger is suspended from all activities of the African Union As to our position, Russia believes that a change of power in any country must take place through constitutional means In the course of the events in Niger, none of our compatriots were hurt The Russian embassy in Mali, representing the interests of Russia in Niger, maintains telephone contact with the Honorary Consul of the Russian Federation in that country, A Iro The Russian Foreign Ministry continues to closely monitor the situation in the Republic of Niger and advises against travel to that country We still have no official information about the essence of the new charges brought by the American side the other day against Russian citizen Viktor Bout, arrested in Bangkok in March 2008, whose case after a Thai criminal court on August 11, 2009 ruled against extraditing our compatriot to the US is currently before the appellate court According to reports, a new request for the Russian s extradition over the new charges so far has not been transmitted to the Thai authorities No matter how the situation may evolve around Viktor Bout, we intend to continue to take the necessary steps to defend his lawful rights and interests We hope that the Appeal Court of Thailand will take a decision that will allow the Russian citizen to return home soon In late March early April this year, the Tampere court of second instance is to examine the appeal of Rima Salonen against the verdict of guilty rendered in her case at the end of last year (remember she was handed a suspended jail sentence of 18 months) At the same time the court of Kokemaki is to hold a hearing on the application of Rima Salonen for restoration of her right to the custody of her underage son, Anton Rima Salonen is provided with the aid of a lawyer who is highly qualified and has extensive experience in representing the interests of Russians in the Finnish courts In relation to the road accident in northern India in which six Russian citizens were injured, the consular department of the Embassy of Russia in India routinely informed us about the following The accident occurred on the morning of February 23 this year Six residents of Yekaterinburg and the Sverdlovsk Region (three men and three women) were heading to the city of Rishikesh They fell behind the main group of 20 tourists, and to catch up with them, hired a taxi van According to the tourists, the Indian driver lost control The taxi van jumped into the oncoming lane, collided with a truck and overturned As a result of the collision the Russians received injuries of varying severity and were taken to a hospital in Hardwar On the evening of February 24 four tourists in satisfactory condition checked out of the hospital Another victim was discharged on February 25 One Russian woman remains in the hospital She was operated on for a brain hemorrhage and will continue treatment there for 5 6 days Question: How is the formation of the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia going? Is Ukraine s accession to the Customs Union possible? Answer: It can be noted that elements of the Customs Union at the initial stage after its launch on January 1, 2010 are generally functioning successfully Some problems of a transition period ù have come out They are associated with the use of the Single List of Goods that are subject to prohibitions and restrictions on import or export by member states in trade with third countries (Single List hereafter) These problems are due to the inclusion in the Single List of goods in respect of which permits had not been previously required They are currently being solved by the parties Regarding the possible accession of Ukraine, I can say the following Russia does not see legal obstacles to the possibility of Ukraine s accession to the Customs Union launched on January 1, 2009 There is a rule on the entry, as a first step of a new member state into EurAsEC and, as a second step, its accession to the juridical base of the Customs Union Of course, for the solution of this question a consensus of the EurAsEC member states is required at stage one, and of the Customs Union member states at stage two Question: How is the situation evolving in the case of Russian citizen Inga Rantala? Answer: Russian overseas agencies in Finland are providing Russian citizens Inga and Robert Rantala with the necessary consular assistance to protect their interests This work should be built on a legal plane The Consulate General of Russia in Turku maintains contact with both Inga Rantala and the Finnish local authorities, including social care bodies On February 23 our Consul General in Turku visited the orphanage in Turku where he met with Robert Rantala The boy has normal upkeep We are currently awaiting a response from Finnish authorities to our request to clarify all the circumstances of Robert s removal from the family Question: There has been information about the upcoming visit to Russia of DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Kun Sun Un How could you comment on it? With whom are his talks planned in Moscow? Answer: I can confirm that in early March DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Kun Sun Un is arriving in Moscow for routine consultations, under the Plan of Inter MFA Consultations agreed upon by Russia and the DPRK for the current year His Russian partner in the talks will be Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin Question : Netanyahu s recently announced decision to include the Cave of the Patriarchs (Abraham s Tomb) in Hebron and Rachel s Tomb in Bethlehem in Israel s list of national heritage sites has led to increased tension in the West Bank, especially at the environs of and in Hebron itself There were even clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces Have you comments? Answer: Let me say briefly We have repeatedly said that we are in principle opposed to any steps or actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations on a final Israeli Palestinian settlement, and cannot fail to complicate the efforts to promote resumption of dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis The statement referred to can well be attributed to such actions Moreover, we re talking about very sensitive issues that have deep religious roots Question: Russia has repeatedly stated that it would like to see in the new START treaty a linkage between offensive arms and missile defense What problems are there in this regard?Answer: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has recently given quite a lot of explanations on this score at press conferences and in interviews I would also like to draw your attention to the extensive interview of Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov to Interfax news agency on February 19 in this connection So there s nothing I can add to those statements Question: How could you comment on the statement by Clinton regarding NATO and its relations with Russia? Answer: There is a lot of discussion on this subject at present, both within NATO and in the United States Thus, on February 22 23 Washington hosted the fourth and final seminar in the framework of the Wise Men Group headed by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the draft of NATO s renewed Strategic Concept, which is expected to be approved at the next summit of the alliance (Lisbon, November this year) Russia is not a member of NATO, but we cannot help but wonder in what direction the transformation of the alliance will go, to which the future Strategic Concept inter alia will obviously provide a vector NATO is a weighty factor in the landscape of Euro Atlantic security and stability, including at our borders So what kind of alliance it is going to be will directly affect the security interests of Russia, and largely impact the architecture of European security Therefore, we carefully study the reports of the discussions on the renewed Strategic Concept of the alliance, including at the seminar in Washington As noted in the previous briefing at the Ministry on February 19, Russia s approaches on problematic issues and prospects of Russia NATO relations were set out to NATO s wise men ù during their visit to Moscow on February 9 11 We would like to reiterate that we are seriously worried by attempts to give the alliance global functions, by the desire for further expansion of NATO, by its military infrastructure being moved up to Russian borders, and by the increase in the number of possible scenarios for the use of its military capabilities in circumvention of international law, including in such non core ù spheres as energy security, cyber defense, and climate change, and in the Arctic We hope that the thoughts and concerns expressed by Russia will be taken into account in the wise men s recommendations and in the future NATO Strategic Concept proper Question: Russia is changing its co chair of the OSCE Minsk Group Instead of Yuri Merzlyakov, Igor Popov has been appointed What is the further fate of Mr Merzlyakov? And what can you say about the mission of Mr Popov and Russia s role in the Minsk Group in connection with these changes? Answer: Yuri Merzlyakov has got a new diplomatic assignment, which is quite natural for a Foreign Ministry staff member Do not rush things I think that after Yuri Merzlyakov steps down as Ambassador at Large and Co Chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, we will be able to speak about appointing a new representative I am confident that his work will be full scale and no less vigorous than his predecessor s I would like to add that Russia s position in the Minsk Group is not determined by representatives It is determined by the President of the Russian Federation and implemented by the foreign affairs agency So let s wait for the change of our representatives And I repeat once again that for its part Russia is doing everything necessary to retain an active role in the Minsk Group Question: On February 26 the Azerbaijani nation commemorates the Day of Khojaly Genocide In this regard, Azerbaijan has scheduled a series of activities What is the attitude of the Russian Foreign Ministry to this date? Answer: Not ready to give you a comment I will take this question to elaborate later  RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/missile-defense-foreign-ministry/
"24 Feb, 2010","Russia demands ‚Äúaction, not words‚Äù over NATO, US anti-missile system","Responding to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s assurances that Russia should not fear NATO s advance, Russian ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin wants more than words In a speech that outlined NATO s mission for the 21st Century, Hillary Clinton emphasized that the 28 member military organization presents no threat to Russia While Russia faces challenges to its security, NATO is not among them, ùthe US Secretary of State told an audience assembled at a Washington hotel ballroom on Monday We want a cooperative NATO Russia relationship that produces concrete results and draws NATO and Russia closer together ù Clinton then said that the key to NATO Russian relations is a high level of transparency in order to dispel Moscow s fears that the alliance will one day turn on Russia European security will benefit if NATO and Russia are more open about our armaments, our military facilities, and our exercises, Clinton continued NATO and Russia should have a regular exchange of information on posture, doctrine, and planned military exercises, as well as specific measures to permit observation of military exercises and to allow visits to new or significantly improved military installations ù Dmitry Rogozin, the tough talking Russian ambassador to NATO, wasn t buying a word of it In my view, Mrs Clinton s speech failed to answer the questions that Moscow has repeatedly raised with its US and NATO partners, ùhe told Interfax on Tuesday Rogozin then cited a long list of complaints aimed at NATO and its spontaneous expansion eastwards ù We cannot be happy with these rules, ùhe said A unilateral world, NATO centrism, the alliance s spontaneous expansion eastwards and refusal to recognize the principle of integrity and security ù The failure to take into account Russia s and its partners interests is a burp of the Cold War, ùthe ambassador said And Russia is not sitting by idly as NATO continues to encroach eastward At a February 5 session of the Russian Security Council, President Dmitry Medvedev said he had approved Russia s updated military doctrine, which ranked NATO expansion as a major threat Russia s new military doctrine mentions, amongst other threats, the desire to invest the military potential of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with global functions, carried out in violation of international law, and advance the NATO member states military infrastructure closer to Russia s border, particularly by expanding the bloc ù But Russia had been making overtures to its partners that the European security architecture needs to be overhauled to reflect all of the parties interests In November 2009, Moscow made a push for the United States and Europe to embrace a new security structure on the European continent that would finally remove stereotypical Cold War rationale ù from NATO s mission statement The first two articles (entire document availablehereon the President of Russia s official website ) of the European Security Treaty proposal make it clear that Russia wants its security interests taken into account before NATO does business in the former s geopolitical backyard Article 1 According to the Treaty, the Parties shall cooperate with each other on the basis of the principles of indivisible, equal and undiminished security Any security measures taken by a Party to the Treaty individually or together with other Parties, including in the framework of any international organization, military alliance or coalition, shall be implemented with due regard to security interests of all other Parties The Parties shall act in accordance with the Treaty in order to give effect to these principles and to strengthen security of each other Article 2 A Party to the Treaty shall not undertake, participate in or support any actions or activities affecting significantly the security of any other Party or Parties to the Treaty Clinton, in her speech on Monday, denied that there was any need to embrace a new security architecture in Europe Given the US military s reckless globetrotting since 9/11, and without the approval of the wider international community, Moscow seems right to question if NATO is designed less with defending the European continent than with giving America an excuse for flexing its military muscles for ultimately unilateral, nationalistic purposes Following US President Barack Obama s decision in September to scrap his predecessor s plans for an anti missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, it seemed that all the talk of a US Russian reset ù was more than just words So far, it appears words are all that were on offer No sooner had Obama killed the anti missile shield, than US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was telling reporters in the Pentagon that the United States had plans to build a new system Here is Gates glowing about the system in an article that appeared in The New York Times, September 19, 1009: In the first phase, to be completed by 2011, we will deploy proven, sea based SM 3 interceptor missiles weapons that are growing in capability in the areas where we see the greatest threat to Europe The second phase, which will become operational around 2015, will involve putting upgraded SM 3s on the ground in Southern and Central Europe All told, every phase of this plan will include scores of SM 3 missiles, as opposed to the old plan of just 10 ground based interceptors ù Gates concludes his hand wringing plans by stating that this system will be a far more effective defense should an enemy fire many missiles simultaneously At the same time, plans to defend virtually all of Europe and enhance the missile defense of the United States will continue on about the same schedule as the earlier plan as we build this system over time, creating an increasingly greater zone of protection ù A child could understand the implications of such a system steaming like a pile of horse manure on Russia s doorstep In the event of some future crisis, either in Russia or elsewhere, and especially if Washington is once again under the sway of a war president, ù such a defensive ù anti missile system could tempt less rational minds to carry out an offensive action in the belief that no reprisal would be technically feasible due to the (unproven) missile umbrella In other words, anti missile defense in Europe will very likely do exactly the opposite of what its makers proclaim it will: defend Europe from outside attack And the Europeans, despite a better than average educational system, are viewing the issue myopically, as if the United States itself, as it has proven so tragically in Iraq, will not carry out some military mission that is (yet again) diametrically opposed to Europe s interests So let the Americans build their anti missile system, but at least make darn certain that more than one nation s finger is on the trigger The fact that Washington refuses to relinquish such almighty control speaks volumes about their real intentions So who can really blame Russia for doubting America s stated intentions, especially when Obama the Peace President may be voted out of office in three short years and the Neolithic neocons go back to Washington? We would still like to understand whether the US is really going to hold not only its own finger, but also those of its partners, on the button for using missile defense systems I personally have very strong doubts about that, ùRogozin, commenting on Clinton s statement that Washington supports the idea of NATO inviting Russia to create a joint missile defense system Russia s NATO ambassador then said that too many uncertainties surround the missile defense issue, including partnership in creating such a system, and exactly what threats the system protects against Initially, we suggested moving according to a certain logic that is clear to everyone, the ambassador said First, missile threats must be identified, Rogozin said There must be a joint review that will identify these threats and those challenges that exist, in particular, in the area of spreading missile technology and possible delivery of weapons of mass destruction by ballistic missiles Once we have jointly decided who is threatening us, when such a threat could become real, where it is emanating from and what steps can be taken to overcome this threat, only then must we proceed to the next stage, he said The second stage involves the use of political and diplomatic measures against the threatening party, he said If this does not work, the third stage comes into effect: putting economic pressure on the transgressing nation And only if all these three steps fail to produce any result, can we talk about cooperation in metal, that is about creating a collective missile defense system, Rogozin said Presently, however, Russia s partners † primarily the United States are following a different logic First they bilaterally agree with some European state, southern or Baltic, then leaving us to find this news from the media, which is not quite the approach between partners, Rogozin said It is totally obvious that in the missile defense policy, the NATO partners are putting the cart before the horse, Rogozin continued NATO style partnership on missile defense consists of one thing: partner states must make their resources, primarily their territory, available for the deployment of US missile defense systems This sort of cooperation is unlikely to cause optimism with Russia This is why we are asking once again to prove, not just in words, but first of all in deeds, that Washington is prepared for real serious cooperation on missile defense So, speaking of the US Secretary of State s proposals, I can only say one thing: the words really sound music to the ear, however we would like to decide on real action, not words, the ambassador said in the interview with Interfax The NATO Russia Council finished a series of debates in drawing up a review of common threats in Brussels on Friday Now, along with the ambassadors proposals and recommendations, it will be passed to civilian and military experts, so that the review become a finalized political document by April, when an informal NATO Russia Council meeting at the ministerial level is to take place, Rogozin told Interfax following the meeting The passage of this document will help broaden cooperation between Moscow and the alliance and overcome mistrust that still exists between the two, Rogozin said We would have the chance to become friends in opposing a common enemy † the threats that are directed against the northern civilization, he said Asked to specify what common enemy is implied, Rogozin continued, We are not inclined to point at anyone † and this is Russia s position now Meanwhile, according to a news report by RIA Novosti, Russia and the United States may agree to the terms of a new arms reduction treaty following a phone conversation between Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, scheduled to take place in several days, a senior Russian lawmaker said on Wednesday But all may hinge on US plans for missile defense in Eastern Europe The issue of interconnectedness between the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and ABM treaties is a problem that will arise during the State Duma ratification process of a new START treaty, visiting Chairman of the Duma Committee for International Relations Konstantin Kosachev, who arrived in Washington in the framework of interparliamentary contacts, told journalists on Wednesday Attention was drawn to the fact that during ratification of the new START at the State Duma priority would be given to the fact as to whether a problem of interconnection between the START and ABM treaties was solved This problem is of key importance to us, Kosachev said Russia would like to have an agreement on missile defense with the U S in this or that form, be it a new treaty or an appendix to the strategic offensive arms treaty, or any other legally bindingform, he said If there are no restrictions and if the U S does not have a restriction to develop its missile defense systems, this will sooner or later kill the disarmament process, because, having unlimited interceptor missile capabilities, it would be wrong to expect the weapons levels to be reduced, he said This position is not opposed by the U S at the political level, but we feel that there are various viewpoints on this subject in Washington, he said Kosachev is currently leading a delegation of the State Duma s foreign affairs committee that arrived in Washington for talks on trade and economic ties with US congressmen And his trip made him privy to information that could have bearing on the negotiations A phone conversation between the two presidents is to take place in the next few days It is being prepared now It might signify a breakthrough, Kosachev added Russia and the US are currently holding talks to replace the START 1, the cornerstone of post Cold War arms control agreement that expired on December 5, 2009 Obama and Medvedev pledged at their first meeting in April 2009 to replace the START I treaty as part of broader efforts to reset bilateral ties strained in recent years The new treaty s outline, as agreed on by the Russian and US leaders, includes cutting nuclear arsenals to 1,500 1,675 operational warheads and delivery vehicles to 500 1,000 Kosachev said the US side is more optimistic about the deal, saying that only a few minor details are to be finished The Russian side is more pessimistic, saying that some serious disagreements remain between the two states and that the US side should show more flexibility However, the possibility to complete the talks in the next two or three weeks is quite high, he said The Russian lawmaker also said the ties are getting better, but still require major improvements The Russian US relations are making progress They are better than during the last century, but are there is still room for improvement, he said, according to Interfax However, the past year brought more expectations than results Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005

"16 Feb, 2010",Iran and Palestine tied up in Netanyahu‚Äôs Moscow talks,"Israel has reportedly asked Russia to support sanctions with teeth ù in order to help deal with Iran s controversial nuclear program Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been discussing the Iranian problem with President Medvedev during his visit to Moscow After the first day of talks there has been no official response from Russia yet The official story is that Benjamin Netanyahu has come to Russia to promote bilateral relations Unofficially, it is thought that the real reason is whether or not Russia will support a fourth round of sanctions against Iran The Israeli Prime Minister was set to try to get Russia on Israel s side on the issue of Iranian uranium The Islamic Republic so far has remained unrepentant when it comes to its nuclear program Just recently it claimed it is expanding it Several days ago, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated that his country is now capable of enriching uranium to up to 20 per cent, which is just a step from getting technology for reaching the 90 per cent enrichment level necessary for production of nuclear weapons Emily Landau from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv said the international community should impose, in Hillary Clinton s terms, crippling ù sanctions on Iran to return Iran to serious negotiations As long as Iran does not feel any pressure from the international community it has no reason to negotiate seriously because it is bent on achieving a military capability for the regional influence that it would gain thereby, ùLandau told RT ùTherefore, Iran s calculation needs to be changed and sanctions, and other forms of pressure, have a role in changing their cost/benefit analysis of the status quo, ùshe said Benjamin Netanyahu may be demanding from Russia to ban nuclear co operation with Iran by saying that the republic is not a reliable partner, in which Russia has so far remained unconvinced While Israel is pressing for tough sanctions against Iran, it is widely assumed that it itself is a nuclear power Irina Zvyagelskaya, Vice President of the Center for Strategic and Political Studies calls it a double standard ù: International policy in general is a double standard policy, everybody knows it, but in case of Israel the main goal is to preserve their nuclear monopoly in the region That is why Israel was against Iraqi attempts to create a nuclear reactor And there are other indications that it s very important for Israel to remain the lone nuclear power in the area ù Russia has been backing Iran in its aspiration to peaceful nuclear energy What is more important, Russia has always been against the use of military force against Iran, while Washington does not rule out any course of action, much to the concern of Moscow The US military have clearly outlined plans to strike Iran if necessary The consequences could be terrible, not only for the Asian continent, but also for the whole of the international community It is hard to predict what will come out of it, ùsays General Nikolay Makarov, Chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff Russia remains committed to relying on the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main authority for the nuclear energy in the world Moscow has repeatedly made it clear that it wants a diplomatic solution of the Iranian issue However those voices supporting sanctions against Iran are only getting louder in Russia Iran is definitely a very important issue, we re definitely very much concerned about the recent developments there and my personal opinion as a Russian politician is that Russia should be stronger in its approach towards Iran and should support at least economic sanctions, though not military actions, against Iran, ùsaid Konstantin Kosachev, the head of Russia s State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Meanwhile, the timing of Israeli Prime Minister s visit to Moscow is really special because he has come to Moscow on the heels of Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, who arrived in Moscow last Monday for discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on a new plan for negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders Shortly before that, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas visited Russia for talks with President Dmitry Medvedev The fact that all parties of the Middle East conflict chose Moscow demonstrates that Russia is becoming the major peace broker in the region, which the world is taking notice of It shows that Russia is willing to engage all parties of the Middle East peace settlement, something the US has failed to do so far The Palestinian knot The story line hasn t changed much over the decades † Israel and the Palestinians as far apart as ever, despite the hands on involvement of American presidents from Carter to Obama But for all the peace summits and road maps, none have got very far Trying to solve the Middle East peace process is an attractive goal for any world power But it would seem that many American diplomats have perhaps overestimated the willingness of Arab countries to make concessions to Israel And for Israel, in turn, to implement a complete freeze on Jewish settlements on disputed lands After the Soviet Union cut relations with Israel in 1967 following the Six Day War, Washington was left to control the game as it desired Russia was too busy with domestic affairs and economic challenges to really perform an important role in negotiations here, and at the time the US felt very powerful as it won the Cold War and it didn t want to share the glory of mediation and negotiation with other participants, ùProfessor Eytan Gilboa from Bar Ilan University told RT Ghassan Khatib has spent most of his life campaigning for Palestinian Israeli dialogue He was a delegate to the Madrid Conference in 1991 † which the US and Soviet Union jointly sponsored to try to break the deadlock † and attended talks in Washington that year He says the main reason for the lack of progress has been America s bias towards Israel, which he believes works both ways, adding I believe that Israel is selective in its international relations They insist on a solo American role in the peace process because they are comfortable with the American approach to the peace process and they discourage others like Russia and Europe from taking part in international efforts and they try to encourage a relationship with Russia on other issues, such as the Iranian threat, because they believe Russia can play a role in this regard ùThat is precisely why many believe Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu is visiting Moscow He is expected to ask the Russian leadership to ban any weapons deals with Iran, and not to provide any nuclear know how to Tehran In turn, his promise would be Israeli participation in any Russian sponsored Middle East peace initiative Peter Stegney, Russian ambassador to Israel, said: We are trying to help to reach direct dialogue between the sides because we believe that a comprehensive, viable and just solution might be reached in the framework of direct talks The sides of the conflict have to decide what the terms of such an agreement are ù Russia has dialogues with Israel s foes † Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran † putting it in a unique position to act as go between But not everyone believes that that makes Moscow the ideal mediator Iran and its allies are committed to preventing a settlement with Israel and Russia does not have the leverage on Iran to change that, notes Dr Jonathan Rynhold from Begin Sadat centre for Strategic Studies As far back as several years ago, Moscow first proposed holding a Middle East conference involving all the parties to try to finally find peace

"11 Nov, 2009",Forging a new START,"As the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 1) draws near, there is a renewed energy surrounding both Russia and the United States to take the next step in the disarmament process Both Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have made it clear that continuing to develop positive relations between their two countries is essential, and it is agreed on the surface, at least, that the new START agreement and how it plays out will be a good indicator as to the sincerity of their words For the most part, the world community believes that a new agreement is in order, but the situation is far more complex than putting signatures to parchment Each side has new issues and interests to bring to the table that could easily compromise negotiations and are beyond the control of the two main countries involved There is even some speculation as to whether a new treaty is even possible given the new, ever changing geopolitical climate The current nuclear weapons arsenal was amassed during the Cold War as two countries with differing ideologies faced off in a global power play START 1 was signed in 1991 by Presidents George H Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev as necessary means to reel in both the US and the Soviet Union, with both parties recognizing the true threat of such military stockpiles Since 1991 the world has changed drastically The Soviet Union no longer exists and the interests of the United States have moved away from any sort of Iron Curtain ù to the deserts of the Middle East Since the Obama administration has come into power there has been a concerted effort to reset ù relations with modern Russia This policy was even physically demonstrated by Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in the form of a gag gift to Russia s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov a reset button Though there were problems in the translation of the word reset ù on the button itself, Clinton stated the gift represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is, We want to reset our relationship And so we will do it together ù The optimism presented in the Secretary of State s gesture was met in kind by Russian interests as well Following Hilary Clinton s October visit to Moscow, Joseph Cirincione of Ploughshares Foundation told RT, I expect that we will have a deal on December 5, and this will be a major part of resetting US Russia relations ù Arguably the most important topic in terms of resetting relations between the two powerhouse countries is maintaining military security specifically missile defense In October 2009, both the US and Russia started talks in Geneva about renewing START 1 On the outset, the possibility of a successful agreement seems promising The Russian government announced the progress following a telephone conversation between the two heads of state, Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama are counting on preparing a legally binding document on the START agreement by the beginning of December, ù the Kremlin said To gain a perspective on the possible success of a new START, it is important to study the success of previous disarmament treaties and how they relate to the current political structure The Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 (ABM Treaty), was signed by both the USSR and the US to ban the use and further development of missile defense systems Both parties adhered to the treaty until 2002, when the Bush administration pulled out of the agreement in order to develop a comprehensive missile defense shield, allegedly to protect from an Iranian nuclear threat The American plan would have put radar systems and defense missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland, too close to the Russian border for the Kremlin to be comfortable In a strong arm reaction to US plans to increase its military footprint into former Soviet territories, President Medvedev announced in his annual state of the nation speech that he would deploy short ranged missiles to Kaliningrad near the Polish border Shortly after President Obama s visit to Moscow in July, Medvedev addressed the press on the matter of America s missile defense intentions at the G8 summit in Italy If we don t manage to agree on the issues, you know the consequences What I said during my state of the nation address has not been revoked, ù Medvedev said The US claimed the reasoning for the strategic placement of systems within the Czech Republic and Poland hinged on the idea that Iran was developing long range delivery systems for their future nuclear arsenal Citing new information that Iran had changed its strategy from long range to short ranged weapons delivery systems, the Obama administration announced in September, that they would be scrapping the plans for developing a missile defense shield in Central Europe As the missile defense shield was a key bone of contention for the Kremlin, the announcement has eased tensions enough for real talks on the START renewal to continue Though a lot of focus has been placed on the renewal of START 1, it is important to recognize that it is just one part of a labyrinth of disarmament agreements between Russia (or the former Soviet Union) and the United States The primary focus of START 1 was to dramatically reduce the number of nuclear warheads each country could use by imposing limits on the means of delivery Following the collapse of the USSR, the former Soviet states Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine followed START 1 by either disposing of their weapons or transferring them to Russia Though the treaty limits delivery systems, it does not specifically limit the amount of warheads each country could possess Thus, a second treaty was in order to address this issue Though the topic at hand is the renewal of START 1, there have been other STARTs ù as well START 2 was a treaty that dealt with new MIRV technologies which allowed existing delivery systems to deploy multiple warheads allowing for greater destruction Signed in 1993 by George H W Bush and Boris Yeltsin, START 2 banned the use of MIRV s, and though the treaty was ratified, it was never enforced The US Senate immediately adopted the treaty after it was signed by the two presidents, but the Duma put the document on the backburner as a protest to the US invasion of Iraq, Kosovo and even NATO expansion As time moved on, America s time and attention moved to modifying the 1972 ABM treaty, a move that was not welcomed at all by Russia In 2000, the Duma did in fact ratify START 2, but only on the condition that the United States preserve the integrity of the ABM treaty On June 13, 2002 the Bush administration unilaterally pulled out of the ABM agreement, and in response Russia pulled out of START 2 the following day In 2002 the Treaty Between the United States and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions ù (SORT) was ratified Whereas START 1 dealt with means of delivery, SORT focused primarily on limiting the number of operational warheads each country can own, and as such functioned as a more adequate successor to START 2 Though the intentions of the agreement seem pure enough, there are problems with SORT as well Though limitations of operational warheads are imposed, there is no wording in the treaty that requires either country to destroy them Another criticism is the fact that either country can pull out of the agreement with only three months of written notification, leading to speculation that the treaty was designed for dramatic effect, rather than for sincere disarmament efforts As both countries are now in the process of negotiating the latest START, the question is: will it be a new, progressive look at the process or will it be merely a continuation of old rhetoric? A look at recent history between the two nations in regards to nuclear disarmament suggests an inherent lack of trust The key to meeting the December 5, 2009 deadline for the next generation START agreement is to truly emphasize the resetting ù of relations and move past old differences START 1 was conceived during the Cold War in which both the United States and the Soviet Union were rival nations The focus of START 1 was to reduce nuclear stockpiles within the two countries who have amassed the majority of the world s nuclear arsenal Now that the two nations are no longer at odds, the focus of a new START is aimed less at keeping two nations from destroying each other and more at the simple reduction of a dangerous arsenal Unfortunately Russia and the United States are not the only players in the nuclear weapons field Three other nations the United Kingdom, France and China make up the remaining Nuclear Weapons States as outlined in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty Aside from the main five, it is believed that India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel have nuclear warheads and that Iran is working to develop its own nuclear weapons program The concern facing both Russia and the United States is the potential to face hostile nations possessing technology of mass destruction Given this global dynamic, it is important for the US and Russia to lead by example and successfully reduce their own stockpiles without giving up their own use of nuclear weapons as a deterrent The trick is to structure the new START agreement in such a way that allows both nations to work together to achieve disarmament while maintaining security for themselves and the rest of the world as well The Global Zero Commission is an organization made up of world leaders and top military brass who have the collective goal of eliminating nuclear weapons entirely from the face of the earth In a statement released by the group, Richard Burt the former ambassador to Germany, chief US negotiator for the START 1 negotiations and the Global Zero US chair said, Global Zero applauds President Obama on receiving the Nobel Prize and for his extraordinary leadership, along with President Medvedev, to achieve a world without nuclear weapons ù This award reflects a new international consensus that whatever stability nuclear arsenals may have provided during the Cold War is now outweighed by the growing risks of proliferation and nuclear terrorism and that the only way in the long term to eliminate the nuclear threat is to eliminate all nuclear weapons, ù Burt said Relatively new on the global stage of influence, Global Zero has set out an aggressive timeline to eliminate the world s nuclear arsenal by 2030, but the first stage of their plan hinges on the success of a new START agreement Unfortunately, Richard Burt and the Global Zero Commission have doubts as to whether real progress can be achieved by the December 5 deadline There is, I think, a feeling in certain circles in the Russian defense establishment that their conventional forces are rundown and as a result they are going to have to rely more on their nuclear forces, ù Burt said, adding, And if that becomes solidified into Russian policy, then the idea of getting to really significant reductions, to zero, is going to be very difficult ù In an article released by Voice of America (VOA), Steve Andreasen, an arms control expert from the University of Minnesota, said that both Presidents Obama and Medvedev have agreed to key points in what will become the replacement START agreement They agreed that in terms of strategic nuclear warheads to be limited, the two sides would basically work to get to a range of 1,500 to 1,675 warheads on both sides And they also agreed that on the question of limiting nuclear delivery vehicles, they would agree to limitations in a range between 500 and 1,100,"" Andreasen said Focusing both on delivery methods and the quantity of warheads is a more comprehensive approach than the original START 1 arrangement and thus would prove to be more beneficial Also both sides are interested in an accurate verification system that accounts for the warheads and their status By most accounts, the world community is pleased with the outward progress and apparent sincerity of Obama and Medvedev in forging a new relationship with a mutual goal of disarmament, but the hang up may be in the deadline alone Though negotiations toward a new agreement continue in good faith, experts say that having an enforceable treaty in place by December 5 is unlikely Also, speaking to VOA, Former US National Security Officer Frank Miller spoke on the challenge of the December deadline I have talked with people on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and they suggest that it would take several months for the Senate to organize itself and to hold proper hearings, which would allow US Senate advice and consent to the treaty, ratification of the treaty So we do face a prospect that the START treaty will expire without a replacement actually being in place by December 5, ù Miller said In order for a new START to be adopted it will take time, trust and a willingness for both the US and Russia to compromise Beyond the good faith of the two heads of state, a successful agreement will also require the ratification of both the Senate and the Duma, a process which can be quite lengthy The hope now is that both parties can work together to negotiate an interim agreement that will extend the current START 1 parameters until a new accord can be written Sean Thomas, RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy

"19 Oct, 2009",ROAR: Opposition returns to ‚Äúcomfortable chairs‚Äù after parliament walkout,"Russian opposition parties in the State Duma will not be able to revise the results of regional elections, but the authorities will pay more attention to them, analysts say Three Russian parties the Communist Party, Fair Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party walked out of the State Duma on October 14 in protest against allegedly rigged elections On October 11, regional and municipal elections were held in 75 regions, in which the ruling party United Russia triumphed It won, in particular, 32 of 35 seats in the Moscow City Duma, while the Communists won the remaining three On October 16, the members of Liberal Democratic Party and Fair Russia returned to parliament The Communists said that they would continue the boycott until all their demands were met Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading member of the Communist Party s faction in the State Duma, believes that the decision to walk out of the parliament was not about the personal ambitions of politicians ù This is a question about the forming of politics, so the opposition s actions are fully justified, and they are supported by the majority of Russians, ù he told Regions ru website The opposition parties formulated seven demands, Ilukhin said, and the main one was the meeting with the president Ilyukhin added that the Communists wanted to recount votes in some Russian regions and to dismiss the head of Central Elections Commission Vladimir Churov Commenting on the boycott, Churov called this move a political action, scheduled for the visit of an important foreign guest, ù apparently referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s trip to Russia Russian President Dmitry Medvedev agreed to meet the representatives of the three parties on October 27 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the head, but not a member of United Russia, in his turn, said on October 14 that if anyone had doubts about the legitimacy of elections, they should go to court and provide proof ù Analysts, however, are certain that the Communists will soon join their colleagues in the parliament The CPRF was left alone to defend a package of very tough measures, to the point of cancellation of the elections results, ù commentator Konstantin Yemelyanov wrote on Politcom ru website Fair Russia returned to the State Duma after saying that it was satisfied by the decision to establish a commission on monitoring electoral legislation The parliament will also hold hearings with the participation of the head of the Central Elections Commission These reasons for A Just Russia retreat were obviously ridiculous and it was clear that other opposition parties will also return, ù Yemelyanov said The parties revolt may be advantageous to the country s leadership Prime Minister and head of United Russia Vladimir Putin seems to be interested in giving his party a good shake, ù believes Aleksey Mukhin, general director of the Center for Political Information The prime minister repeatedly told the United Russia leadership before the election not to be enthusiastic ù about the use of organizational and power resources of regional authorities, the analyst said The election s results are not being annulled, but some governors may be punished in the regions if the cases of fraud are revealed, Mukhin believes However, he is certain that all deputies will soon return to their comfortable chairs ù after playing democracy ù It seems that opposition parties have thought that the authorities may do without them, ù Aleksey Malashenko, analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, thinks So, in any case the resentful parties have nothing to lose, ù he was quoted by Kommentarii ru The analyst even predicted a tough confrontation ù on the political scene if the parties would not return to parliament, but it has not been the case Analyst at the Center for Political Technologies Aleksey Makarkin also believes that the Communists will soon return to business as usual at the State Duma The Russian leadership has recently paid much attention to the opposition parties in the parliament, Makarkin told RBC ru website The president met with them to discuss anti crisis measures, a law was adopted about equal access of all parliamentary parties to mass media, ù Makarkin noted It is said that the Kremlin ordered not to ban candidates on a far fetched pretext, ù he added Makarkin believes that the leadership of the parties reacted to reports sent on the day of voting by their regional activists about violations during the elections At the same time, he called the Liberal Democratic Party and Fair Russia quasi opposition ù The Communists, in his view, are real opposition ù and at the same part an integral part of the current political system At the closed meeting after the walkout, the leadership of the State Duma and representatives of opposition parties discussed not only political questions, but also material interests, ù Regnum news agency reported Analysts were not surprised that the members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Fair Russia changed their mind, ù Gazeta daily wrote It was clear from the beginning that the Kremlin will have problems only with the CPRF, ù Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the analytical department of the Center of Political Technologies, told the paper She called Fair Russia the weakest of all parties in the State Duma ù Ratings and results of the elections confirm this, the analyst said She believes that the crisis seriously undermined positions of that party and ones of Liberal Democratic Party They were not able to show their worth and propose variants of fighting the consequences of the crisis, ù she added Unlike these two parties, the CPRF has its permanent electorate and clear ideology, ù Stanovaya said The Communists may permit themselves to make demarches and a tough line, ù she added It seems that the Kremlin will conclude an offstage agreement with the CPRF, ù Stanovaya said However, the Communists will hardly gain something serious, ù she added If the CPRF secure a revision of the results of the voting somewhere, it will only concern very small towns, ù she said Member of the Public Chamber, journalist and historian Nikolay Svanidze thinks that the demarche of the three parties was senseless ù The opposition is simply trying to justify themselves in the eyes of voters after the defeat, ù he told Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily The parties that walked out of the Duma will meet with the president, Svanidze said However, the question is if they have proof of fraud during the elections If there is proof, they should go to the prosecutor s office, and if there is no proof, then it is interesting what the president will tell them, ù he added Sergey Borisov, RT   ",https://www.rt.com/russia/roar-opposition-returns-comfortable/
"10 Jul, 2009",The untold story of Aleksandr Lukashenko,"On this day 15 years ago Belarus chose its first irreplaceable president, but what is behind the rhetoric of the last dictator of Europe ù? It is time to take a look into this long lasting presidency Lukashenko s victory in the second tour of the election on July 10, 1994, was a surprise for many The clear favourite before the results were announced was Lukashenko s rival Vyacheslav Kebich, then head of the Belarusian government However, the Belarusians seemed to place more confidence in the director of the Gorodets state farm and deputy of the Supreme Council Aleksandr Lukashenko He made the impression of a man closer to the people and more sympathetic with their needs His trump card was the anti corruption rhetoric and activities which he performed as the head of the parliamentary anti corruption committee This part of his image not only proved useful in the time of the struggle for power, but became the fundamental element of Lukashenko s image for years to come Lukashenko came to power as a pure joker none of Belarus foreign partners had a clear attitude towards him Some said he was well acquainted with Russian special services which approved him as a candidate Others said that his political ties with Russia were mainly of a leftist ù nature It is known that his speech at the Russian State Duma in 1994, which brought him more points during the electoral campaign in Belarus, became possible due to support from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and personally Gennady Zyuganov The West was extremely short of information about the new Belarusian president and enthusiastically involved him in international affairs In 1994 1995 Aleksandr Lukashenko met the US president Bill Clinton, and made an official tour across Western Europe Yet very soon the Belarusian president had to make geopolitical choices, which led to a deterioration of Belarus West relations for the following years The young (he was only 40 then) president came to power in a country which was nearing collapse More and more plants of a once developed and industrial Belarus were closing People weren t getting wages The cooperation ties of Belarusian enterprises with their Russian and other ex USSR partners were broken and the times when Belarus was called the assembly room ù of the USSR seemed to have passed forever At the same time Aleksandr Lukashenko could not get loans from the IMF or World Bank to support manufacturers, as the international bodies plans of liberalization and deregulation of economy would finish off deteriorating industries And that was exactly the opposite of what he had intended to do In the 2000s Lukashenko frequently recalled the 1994 1995 period of political struggle in his meetings with common people in different regions of Belarus At every such meeting he asked the workers and farmers one question: Shall we liberalize the economy, fire about half the employees and make our enterprises cost effective, raise the salaries of those still employed and let the fired seek a better life as entrepreneurs; or shall we keep a centralized state dominated economy, preserve the jobs with low salaries and gradually improve the work of enterprises? ù The people always preferred the latter According to Lukashenko, that was what defined his geopolitical choice in the 1990s In reality the choice was based not only on the will of the people ù but also on purely objective factors and Lukashenko s rational calculations On the one hand, choosing the liberal project ù meant firing about half the employed Belarusian workforce with no prospect of small business enterprises created for them, which meant a social catastrophe On the other hand, there was no other political basis for Lukashenko but the post Soviet industrial and agricultural elites of numerous Belarusian state enterprises The second major force in Belarus of the 1990s was presented by the nationalist pro Western groups who despised the new president, regarding him as a kolkhoznik ù (peasant), and would never give him a hand That was why Lukashenko decided to put the preservation of Belarus heavy industry and state collective farms at the core of his political program That decision had imminent geopolitical implications Belarus had to restore its former cooperative ties with suppliers and consumers in the CIS countries, but first of all in Russia That was exactly why from 1994 on Aleksandr Lukashenko became the self proclaimed but recognized leader of the reintegration movement in the post Soviet area Belarus sought benefits while the Russian elite decided to use the reintegration rhetoric in order to widen the support for Boris Yeltsin, who was said to have only 2% approval rating at the beginning of the 1996 presidential campaign Thus, restoring a state centered economy with emphasis on heavy industry and reintegrating at least a part of the former USSR became the two objectives which shaped the so called neo Soviet project ù the basis of Lukashenko s legitimacy for ten successive years There was a strong opposition to the neosovietism ù from Belarusian liberals, nationalists and those who hoped to become the Belarusian Chubais ù ( Chubais ù was a name for anybody who wanted to organize privatization and make money on this) Many people of the initial Lukashenko team ù left him and became perpetual leaders of the opposition, while he became the leader of the state It was then that a number of ex Lukashenko and then opposition figures disappeared They were believed by many to have been killed on the order of the Belarusian president All in all, the struggle for power was fierce and the Belarus of the mid 1990s was a time of thousands gathering, riots and street fights Aleksandr Lukashenko even became the target of an assassination attempt in the town of Liozno in 1994, but that time he was saved by his close associate Viktor Sheiman one of the few persons who, still today, stayed with the president Maybe it was then that Aleksandr Lukashenko decided that he had no choice but to build strong, even hard presidential power in the country Two years after the election he dissolved the Supreme Council (Parliament) and organized a referendum at which a new edition of the Belarusian Constitution was adopted (the results of the referendum are disputed by the opposition and claimed fraudulent in the West) The document gave the president vast powers in comparison with the previous one Later, Aleksandr Lukashenko even compared the Belarus of those days to Germany in 1920 40: The history of Germany is similar to the history of Belarus, at certain periods In its time, Germany was raised from the ruins due to very strong power; and not only bad things in Germany were connected with the well known Adolf Hitler No process or person can be labeled exclusively as black or white Hitler formed a strong Germany due to strong presidential power ù However, those words referred only to the role of the president in the country In general it was anti Nazism and the cult of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War which were made the fundamental value of the Belarusian state The end of the 1990s was marked by a relatively calm political situation in Belarus In spite of the financial economic crisis of 1997 1998 the Belarusian economy sustained its growth The public opposition to Lukashenko became weaker, his popularity with the people in both Belarus and Russia got stronger And that probably was the main factor for the Belarusian president s continuing integration enthusiasm As if to prepare Belarusians to the union with Russia, Aleksandr Lukashenko was pointing out the importance of the Russian language to Belarus: People, who speak Belarusian, cannot do anything else but speak Belarusian, because one cannot express something great in this language Belarusian is a weak language There are only two great languages in the world Russian and English ù Incidentally, it was due to the results of Lukashenko s first 1995 referendum that Russian was given equal status with Belarusian in Belarus Aleksandr Lukashenko s Russian counterpart was the old Boris Yeltsin who was in poor health and was spending more and more time at hospital Thus, many analysts believed that Lukashenko hoped to become the president of both the countries in 2000 or 2001 That would be the proper application for the Union State treaty signed symbolically in Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1999 exactly eight years after the 1991 Belovezhskaya accords which officially dissolved the USSR Yet those hopes did not last long Twenty three days after signing the Union State treaty Boris Yeltsin surprisingly resigned, giving Aleksandr Lukashenko probably the worst present he ever got for the New Year Was it the threat of Batka s coming to power in Moscow which made Russian elites finally agree on a candidate to become Yeltsin s successor? Regardless, the power in Russia was taken up by a young and enthusiastic Prime Minister Vladimir Putin This rearrangement marked the beginning of the Union State project s long lasting crisis the single state of Russia and Belarus had not been created up to now Lukashenko s disappointment with the new situation grew into alleged personal dislike towards Vladimir Putin, but those personal shades did not affect the relations of the two countries until the world oil prices began quickly and steadily rising after 9/11 As analysts agree, that process fomented Russia s role as Europe s raw material supplier and moved the interests of heavy non raw material industry to the periphery of state interests That considerably devalued Belarus importance to Russia and made elites in Moscow reconsider the foundations of the Union Instead of equal rights confirmed by the Union State treaty, the Russian government proposed the idea of Belarus reforming into six regions of the Russian Federation an idea completely unacceptable both to the Belarusian elite and common people Further reconsideration of the Union revealed that the Belarusian economy was heavily subsidized by Russia: Belarus paid reduced prices for gas and was not charged with an export duty for the imported Russian oil, which it reprocessed and further exported to Europe, receiving a substantial margin In 2004 2008 those subsidies ù were considerably cut, which led to a number of rows between the allies (the most important in 2006, when Russia reintroduced the export duty for oil going to Belarus) and major changes in Belarusian politics The most important of those was the beginning of Belarusian multiple vector ù external policy which, first of all, meant restoring normal relations with Europe and the United States The multiple vector ù policy never turned into a European project ù for Aleksandr Lukashenko Despite some progress in mutual relations there is still an abyss between the West and Belarus That was once again proved by the recent PACE resolution on Belarus demanding the abolition of capital punishment and 28 more political changes which would completely transform the Belarusian political system and make Lukashenko s legitimacy dependent on Brussels approval Furthermore, everyone in Belarus is skeptical of prospective economic cooperation with Europe A significant part of Belarusian production would be uncompetitive on the European market and it is already clear that the EU is not going to subsidize Belarus at even half the Russian level That is how Belarus finds itself in a trap while the world financial crisis rages around it An interesting peculiarity of the situation around Belarus is that there had not been an independent autonomous state in this part of Europe for some 500 years Since the middle of the 16th century the territory of Belarus was included into either some Western state or Russia That not only made the independence a brand new challenge for Belarusians (that is why some people in Belarus call Lukashenko Vitovt of the 21st century ù by the name of the Grand Duke of Lithuania who made his country an autonomous Eastern European power which, however, didn t last long), but also created the Belarusian problem ù for the West and Russia Both of them seem to have no model of treating an independent state in Eastern Europe which does not fit into traditional geopolitical schemes The only project for this region is the cordon sanitaire ù between Europe and Russia a destructive invention of British geopolitics designed to prevent the rapid development of Eurasia At the moment, Belarus is being pulled into this project by some European circles (mainly Britain, assisted by partners in Poland, Lithuania and the Ukraine) Thus, Aleksandr Lukashenko is back where he started from At the time of the world economic crisis accepting the European perspective ù would mean destroying national industry, becoming hostile to Russia and eventually losing sovereignty That is hard to accept, but it seems that there is no one in Belarus to offer another perspective This means that in the nearest future we will see either an implementation of some new project masterminded by the Belarusian president, or the great tragedy of a man losing all the gains of the past 15 years Darya Sologub for RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/untold-story-aleksandr-lukashenko/
"3 Jul, 2009",Ensuring the ‚Äúreset‚Äù button stays pressed,"President Obama s upcoming visit to Moscow marks the moment of truth for US Russian relations, which have found themselves in the process of a painful two decade transition, and still remain at the crossroads Glasnost and perestroika, proclaimed by the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, gave a glimmer of hope that the ghosts of the past and Cold War atavisms would be consigned to the history books However, the short honeymoon of the first years of president Yeltsin with his strong anticommunist drive, and liberal economists labeled Chicago boys by the Russian communist opposition, turned into a period of bitter disappointment for both sides In the late 90 s, as the estrangement between the two sides grew stronger, democrats and republicans in Washington were trading accusations and asking themselves the question Who lost Russia? ù: a question which remained unanswered Then there was another chapter of hope and disillusionment started by Vladimir Putin s notorious call to George Bush shortly after September, 11 and George Bush s equally famous remark about the Russian soul , which he discovered in the eyes of ex KGB officer and new friend Paradoxically, as the two presidents enjoyed each others company at numerous summits † driving a legendary Soviet built Volga car in the Black Sea side town of Sochi, or tantalizing their taste buds with delicious swordfish caught by joint effort in the clean waters of the Atlantic Ocean † inter government relations soured As it was in the late 90 s, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction The war in Iraq, constant stalemate and reversal in the disarmament process, growing erosion of the legal framework of the international security system, the Bush administration s plans to deploy ABMs in Eastern Europe and to grant Georgia and Ukraine a NATO accession map all contributed These issues, along with ongoing heated debate on the fate of Russian democracy and new Moscow backed authoritarian regimes in the post Soviet space, reversed bilateral relations to the starting point when Mikhail Gorbachev spelled out his perestroika and new mentality principles It is an open secret that most of the decisions by the Bush administration, which brought an already troubled US Russia strategic partnership to its lowest point since the Cold War, were taken with total disregard of Russia s official position However, it is equally true that it was not only George Bush s stubbornness that brought bilateral relations to their current stage New Russia, awash in oil wealth which, as then President Putin bluntly put it, got up off its knees , never failed to answer Washington with endless angry rebukes and irrational moves The Russian media were overwhelmed with paranoic anti American statements made by numerous experts : MP s from the pro Kremlin United Russia party and proud Cold War veterans, who felt as if their best young days had miraculously come back Some were telling blood curdling stories about the CIA planning to dismember Mother Russia Still others were explaining that the days of the United States were numbered, and soon we would witness the disintegration of the American Empire portraying itself as world police, aggressor and prison of free nations Americans are throwing their weight everywhere and the time is ripe to teach them a lesson Let us cut transit routs to Afghanistan and make them feel the suffocating effects ,a Russian deputy, member of the Duma Foreign Affairs Committee told me last autumn When I asked him if the American failure in Afghanistan met our national interests and if we were ready to step in to combat terrorism, he shouted with indignation, Are you a fool or only pretend to be naive? Do you sincerely believe they are fighting terrorists in Afghanistan? They went there to control the region, and their mission contradicts our interests This was a mood shared not by large part of Russia s ruling elite, but also by ordinary folks here However, the situation is by no means hopeless Today there is another silver lining to the clouds, as President Obama s top foreign policy pundit, Vice President Joe Biden, proposed a second edition of the almost forgotten perestroika of Mikhail Gorbachev, voicing the idea of resetting ù bilateral relations Don t you find it quite symbolic that the two words perestroika and perezagruzka (the resetting button) in Russian language sound almost the same? To Russia with love? It seems that will be President Obama s motto in Moscow, as he discovers the successor of the mighty Soviet Empire and former Cold War arch rival, the country of bullet proof Bentleys and ageing nukes However, I can wager my entire collection of books on diplomacy that we will soon let ourselves into another trap if we fail to derive timely, proper lessons from the mistakes of the past And the question Who lost Russia? will painfully come up again Let us try to sum up these lessons The first point is that we should no longer confuse strategic partnership ù with two leaders personal friendships, making bilateral relations over personalized and lacking substance, as happened on previous occasions We need to formulate positive a bilateral agenda which will make this relationship meaningful and beneficial The second point is that we should tone down the hawks on both sides who view strategic partnership as a path to unacceptable concessions undermining national security Let us not forget that it is presidents who orchestrate the show, and not their milieu, which is trying to win the president s ear and sometimes mislead him, acting on behalf of powerful lobbyists or interest groups The third point is that we should never come back to that notorious senior partner junior partner notion which Washington tried to impose on Russia during Presidents Clinton s and Bush s administrations The official Russian position repeatedly voiced by President Medvedev has made it clear that Moscow will not tolerate it any more And there is no other way to break the vicious circle The fourth point is that we should not only hit the reset button, but also upgrade the computer If the hard disk and the software package are the same, the reset button will soon turn into a useless futile exercise And, finally, let bygones be bygones If we adhere to these principles the question Who lost Russia? will become obsolete Sergey Strokan, Russian newspaper Kommersant staff writer, for RT   ",https://www.rt.com/usa/ensuring-the-reset-button-stays-pressed/
"27 Feb, 2009",Softer reaction on a softer report,"Both the Russian part of the 2008 Human Rights Report by the U S Dept of State, and Russia s reaction to it, are more toned down than in years past, which can be viewed as a positive sign for Russo American relations Negative trajectory The Russian Federation continued a negative trajectory in its overall domestic human rights record with numerous reports of government and societal human right problems and abuses during the year, ùaccording to the report s introduction Meanwhile, the chapter itself (available with therest of the reporton the U S Department of State website) is little more than a list of cases of human rights and freedom abuses, most of which were, in due course, widely reported and discussed in the Russian media More importantly, the chapter doesn t come to a justified conclusion expressed in the introduction, as one would expect from a report of this nature Instead, it notes some positive trends such as a decline in anti Semitism This could be a sign that the chapter on Russia and the introductory part were written by different teams Attributed to Bush s administration It was noted by the Information Department of Russia s Foreign Ministry, which in its response statement (available in Russian on theForeign Ministry website) attributed at least part of the Human Rights Report to George W Bush s team, despite the fact that the report was presented to the United States Congress by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton herself It is our understanding that the report was being composed under the former Republican administration, ù said the Ministry s statement Written in a critical tone, it accused Washington of revamping facts that took place in 2006 2007 ùin order to maintain Russia s image as the main human rights abuser ù Regarding the report s controversial evaluation of Russia s moves to protect its citizens in South Ossetia, the Ministry noted that a similar approach could be used regarding U S actions in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq However, these statements were somewhat played down by the closing lines of the Ministry s statement: In view of the recent statements of the new U S administration on its readiness to conduct a mutually respectful dialog with other countries on a wide range of issues, including the problem of encouraging and protecting human rights, one would like to hope that Washington will alter its approach in preparation of these kind of reports ù In conjunction with earlier statement by Russia s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, this reaction can be considered quite moderate Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Lavrov admitted that Russia has problems surrounding human rights protections We do have such problems, and we speak honestly about them, ùLavrov stated, adding that Russia would never avoid a true and equal ùdiscussion of the human rights protection issue We just have to make sure that such a discussion is based on facts, not biases, and that we don t find ourselves in a situation where political expediency replaces existing legal procedures, or where there is interference with the activities of the judicial branch, ùhe stressed Lavrov also mentioned that Russia has its own Human Rights Report It is presented annually (usually by mid March) by the office of theHuman Rights Commissionerof Russia, Vladimir Lukin (To see the 2007 version of this report in Russian,follow the link) A former Russian ambassador in the U S , Lukin, who was reappointed to his position of Human Rights Commissioner by the State Duma in February, 2009, is one of the most internationally respected figures in Russia s political arena His report usually assesses the same problems mentioned by his U S counterparts Other countries facing various degrees of criticism in the report were Zimbabwe, Sudan, Burma, Azerbaijan, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Somalia, Iraq and China, which received a particularly serious array of reproaches In this year s Human Rights Report, Beijing was accused of severe cultural and religious repression ù of Tibetans and members of the ethnic Uighur group, and limiting freedom of speech, particularly through restricting the use of the internet China s Office of the State Council hit back viciously The U S practice of throwing stones at others while living in a glass house is a testimony to the double standards and hypocrisy of the United States in dealing with human rights issues and has undermined its international image, ù it stated, and published its alternative Human Rights Record of the United States (available in English atXinhua website), which underlined America s own domestic problems with human rights This, however, will hardly hamper Chinese American relations Secretary of State Clinton was in China just one week before presenting the 2008 Human Rights Report where she sought Beijing s cooperation on questions as broad as climate change, the global economic crisis, and security threats She also urged China to continue investing in U S Treasury bonds During these talks, Clinton diplomatically avoided the subject of human rights and Tibet We are talking about the same Hillary Clinton who, during her presidential campaign, called on then head of state George Bush to boycott the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics to protest Chinese policies in Tibet As long as she maintains this kind of flexibility during her meeting with Lavrov next week, the long dreaded warming of Russo American relations is not far away Ruben

"3 Mar, 2008",RT presents: Russia's Choice,"Dmitry Medvedev has gained 70 2% of the vote in Russia Election day in Russia is over and the votes are being counted Already there s little doubt over who is set to replace Vladimir Putin as the country s next president Dmitry Medvedev has what looks like an unassailable lead Stay with RT! March 3, 2008 Sergey Khrushchev is Senior Fellow in International Relations at Brown University in the United States He is also the son of Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union for nearly a decade during the Cold War He joined RT to give his views on Sunday s presidential election, which, he says, was a huge step towards democracy in Russia Khrushchev believes the election will prove to be very important for Russia s history The biggest difference between democracy and autocracy is the respect for the law In a democratic country we have to respect the law, whilst in autocracy we prefer the good will of the leader And here, for the first time in Russian history, we see the person who was in power voluntarily leaving When all Russia begged him on knees please stay longer , Putin said No, we cannot change constitution in interests ù, he said Maria Sladkova, a post graduate student of Russian State Humanitarian university, filled RT s viewers in on education in Russia It can be a matter of choice, or a matter of one s social status, whether you ve got money for this or not It is possible to get private paid education, or you may go to a state university to try and get free education, ùSladkova said An actress and a student of one of Moscow s Boris Shchukin s drama school Laura Keosayan spoke about the trials and tribulations of her trade in Russia and of course the Stanislavsky Method A good professional is someone, who has had a good schooling: at least four years of study and then theater of course, you have to go there to work for yourself, not for the money, hence they don t pay much, ùKeosayan said Andrey Danilenko, the Head of Russian Farms Group and successful businessman told RT about the current state of things in Russian agriculture Agriculture in Russia is all about big landowners Because the Soviet Union was ahead of the world by setting up large collective farms, which were, in essence, the prototype to large corporate farming Today the reality is that the only way to be competitive is to be large, ùAndrey Danilenko said Andrey Chuzhakin, Professor at the Linguistic University compared Russian s past and present linguistic positions Now, more then ever people who don t master a foreign language are facing a disadvantage in Russian society On the contrary Russian as a foreign language reached its heights of popularity in the 1980s, with Gorbachev and Perestroika Now Russian shares the 7 8 place in the rating of world languages with Portuguese, back then it was the third, ùChuzhakin said Regional Director ofMmDRussia, Stephen Lock,gave political adviceto multinational companies He says property development, retail and banking are all hot spots for foreign investors Business is about a commercial return Business sees a long term change in Russia, a change that is already underway and I think in some ways western politicians will play catch up with that in the next few years, ùhe said Political analystViktor Mizinsaid that new trends in Russia s foreign policy do not mean a new Cold War He also speculated on America s next leader Some people say that probably McCain would be a disaster but I do not think this way In the Soviet era and in the new Russia era we managed to deal even with the Republicans, even with the straight talking people The Democrats, especially when they put their stakes on human rights, probably it could be a danger but there is another problem: for example if Obama wins or Mrs Clinton, there are themes like fight against global terrorism, like Iran or Iraq you cannot solve them while getting bad relations with Moscow, ùinsisted Mizin Election commission spokespersonAleksey Gromovtold RT that a record election turnout of 68% in St Petersburg is no surprise, as both Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev come from there People think that they should go to the elections because Dmitry Medvedev is the man who has managed Russian national projects which did come to schools hospitals and homes † it s a sort of gratitude, ùcommented Gromov The Chairman of Russia s State Duma International Committee, Konstantin Kosachev, told RT that Putin is admired by most Russian voters This situation is unique in our modern history, when the President leaving his position is more popular than when he was elected, ùhe said The ruling powers of Russia have managed to work for the interests of the majority of the Russian population, ùKosachev noted Dmitriy Bagrov, an IT specialist from St Petersburg, believes cultural proximity with the West gives Russian producers an advantage compared to other popular software destinations I ve heard a lot about why Russian companies were chosen over Indian or Chinese ones The first and the main reason, of course, apart from being professional and having necessary knowledge, was the cultural proximity, ùsaid Bagrov Tatyana Malkina, Editor In Chief of the Otechestvennie Zapiski magazine,spoke to RT about how civil society is developing in the country I don t think people should be politicised in Russia or anywhere else, that s not the question, ùshe said But I think, that Russian people are too stoic and too patient, they don t take the initiative and don t take the responsibility for their own lives, ùMalkina added Fedor Lukyanov, Editor in Chief of the Russia in Global Affairs magazine, commented on RT about Russia s foreign policy under Vladimir Putin The message of Putin was that Russia still is a great power, ùhe said The international environment is now more multipolar and more interesting than before, I would say But now the task of Dmitry Medvedev will be to convert this general abstract status into practical benefits for the Russian nation, ùhe added Sochi winning the Olympics in 2014was one of the brightest moments for Russia in 2007 Dmitry Chernyshenko, CEO of the Sochi Bid Committee, believes its team philosophy was perfect The great coincidence of such factors as the Olympic movement ideals and our vision for the future brought us †the success, ùsaid Chernyshenko Viktor Vakhstein, from the Golos Association, told RT that Medvedev had a clear advantage in the media There was a huge disproportion in media coverage between Mr Medvedev and all other candidates, ùhe noted Medvedev was mentioned in 64% of publications, which is twice more than other candidates all together, ùVakhstein said Natalya Zamarayeva, Senior Scientific worker of the Oriental Studies Institute, says history and shared values bindRussia and Central Asia together Central Asian countries and Russia have not only common economic interests, but also common history, ùsaid Zamarayeva Russia is back that was Putin s main message to the international community, believes Andrey Kortunov from the New Eurasia foundation Russia s not going to be a junior partner to any other state Russia has its own interests, which it is committed to defend, ùKortunov stressed Matthew Maly, economic expert and author of a book called Russia as it is ù, believesPutin has been driving Russia towards democracy, though the western media s perception of an election may be different Western media represents democracy as a bowl of instant noodles, which everybody knows how to cook and everybody is supposed to like If a favourite of western media wins an election they claim it s a democracy As a result we have a democracy in Kenya or in the Palestinian state, ùsaid Maly Egor Gavrilov, a political analyst from the Russian State University of International Relations, joined RT to share his views onRussia s political legacy and future We can say that while Yeltsin s era can be characterised as a certain retreat of the state, Putin s era is, vice versa, the era of the return of the state apparatus both into the public and economic spheres of † society, ùGavrilov said Kirill Koktyshof the Moscow State University of International Relations, joined RT †to discuss the development of Russia s relations with the CIS countries, and Belarus in particular Aleksey Kuzmin, Chairman of the Expert Council of the National Prospects Foundation in Moscow, joined RT to speak in detail of the four presidential candidates He says Dmitry Medvedev is perfectly equipped for bureaucratic games ù He has got a very serious experience He was the First Deputy Prime Minister and he had the burden of National Projects on him, ùKuzmin said He also commented on the chances of other candidates †winning the election, and gave a short review of their political careers Andrey Zolotov, Editor in Chief of Russia Profile magazine, said to RT that the next few months will be an interesting period in the country s political development What s coming is actually very intriguing because what we can see in the next several months is the formation of the new system of power, ùZolotov said Igor Chestin, the head of the Russian branch of the World Wildlife Fund, joined RT to talk about environmental matters He says despite some positive changes, there s a lot to be done to improve the situation in the country There were dramatic changes when Putin came into power With new administration the environmental committee was dismantled, so there has been no environmental agency in the structure of the government for the past eight years In that sense we compared Russia to other countries, and we found only one which also doesn t have a special designated environmental agency † that s Honduras, ùChestin said Richard Weitzfrom Hudson Institute, Washington DC, commented to RT on how Dmitry Medvedev is viewed in the United States The general feeling is that he is very much Putin s prot√©g√©, but there is also understanding that he may or may not necessarily follow Putin s policies He is not well known among the U S people, ùWeitz said Dmitry Suslovfrom the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy in Moscow joined RT to speak on the probable reaction to the election result in the West and the possible changes in Russia s foreign policy Despite certain reservations that will be and despite the absence of the OSCE monitors team, I think that generally election will be accepted quite positive Since Medvedev was named by Putin as the person he would like to see as the next President, we ve seen some positive reaction from the U S , namely from Condoleezza Rice, from European countries and so on, ùSuslov said Yury Mamchuris a director of the Real Russia Project, an educational project of the †Discovery Institute based in Seattle and Washington, which is aimed at being a credible source of information about Russia Speaking about how America views the possibility of Dmitry Medvedev becoming the new president, he said he thinks ùit s a given fact and it has been for a couple of weeks "" Some see him as a puppet of President Putin who will not have voice of his own and who will serve just as a shell for President Putin to continue his own work and leadership of the country, ùMamchur said However, he says, some Americans, including many businessmen, see positive changes coming Some think he is the most liberal and progressive, and the youngest member of Putin s team He is the only one who doesn t come from siloviki those with former intelligence services or military backgrounds, ùMamchur said RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This
