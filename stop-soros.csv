U not having the rights 2 your own music is just the tip of the iceberg I sure don t want my rights taken away from me by those w/a globalist agenda which Democrats & RINOs support Soros involvement in the multimillion dollar deal is unclear It is also unclear why Swift would go after a man held in such high regard by her liberal peers Soros funds Democratic politicians, judges, and district attorneys in the US, and bankrolls pro immigration and open borders causes in his native Europe Swift, after being hounded by critics for remaining apolitical, emerged as a full fledged liberal last year After Taylor Swift announced she will do everything in her power to see@realDonaldTrumpdoesnt get reelected, I wouldnt care if Soros took everything she had Learning thru your pocket book is the best lesson possiblehttps: // tdotco /v7zbNJIb8N Since endorsing two Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, Swift has attacked President Donald Trump for his supposed autocratic impulses, and vowed to do everything I can ùto stop him being re elected next year or maybe that s the reason she supporters those movements?

"25 Sep, 2019",God Save Our Queen: Elizabeth R dragged into the Brexit Imbroglio (by George Galloway),"Britain never had a Supreme Court in the way it never had a Constitution Yet somehow the political system seemed to work after a fashion, if in a typically British way was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT) He is a film maker, writer and a renowned orator †Follow him †on Twitter@georgegalloway was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT) He is a film maker, writer and a renowned orator †Follow him †on Twitter@georgegalloway When I was serving for nearly 30 years in the British Parliament, the Law Lords shared a rickety corridor and a single secretary high above the chamber of the House of Lords They were the final court of appeal, all of them members of parliament, albeit by appointment rather than election Before Tony Blair set up a separate Supreme Court (who else would be responsible for the distinctly un common law modernisation of a US style Supreme Court ), † the delicate balance between legislature, executive courts and Crown was something to behold A Heath Robinson Affair no doubt But it worked The seismic re writing of an un written constitution by 11 unelected unremovable justices over the prorogation of parliament effectively abolishes the Royal Prerogative exercised by British Prime Ministers for centuries It begins the unravelling of the notion that the PM and the Government represent the Queen in Parliament and on matters in which parliament itself does not preclude them, can exercise executive authority From now on, many, maybe most things, will be ultimately decided not in parliament by elected MPs but in courts by unelected judges Judicial Review just went nuclear This may be a good thing, it may be a bad thing, but it cannot be denied, that no parliament ever agreed to this un elective surgery Thus the constitution of the country has been radically re shaped without a vote being cast Adding insult to injury, the state itself will pay the costs of the case through legal aid The irony is that Boris Johnson s ill fated prorogation of parliament for around an extra week than would be normal at this time of the year and this stage of a parliament served him no purpose whatsoever and this would have been the case even if he had won the case If, as the Court decided, Johnson had set out to stymie (a Scottish Golfing term meaning to frustrate) well he plainly didn t succeed No sooner than he announced it the Benn Burt Bill passed through both Houses of Parliament in record quick time which trussed him up like a turkey, forcing him to abandon his No Deal Brexit negotiating strategy with the EU and to beg them for another three month extension of British membership for starters It is true that the prime minister set out to frustrate the ability of the parliament to stymie him But it is also true that the parliament itself has set out to frustrate the decision of the British people to leave the EU And not for a week but for three long years Although both sides made clear in the Brexit referendum that the people s decision would be final, then jointly triggered Article 50 which set the clock ticking towards exit, then jointly stood for election in 2017 in Theresa May s foolhardily unnecessary election promising to respect the result of the referendum, the narrow outcome of that election put Brexit in trouble from the beginning of this parliament It is a parliament overwhelmingly Remain at heart which gradually recovered its confidence to frustrate the electorate Its confidence was richly boosted by the support of the richest people in the land (indeed the world everyone from George Soros to the American banks have had their tuppence worth ), the deep state, the EU itself, the financial sector (virtually unanimously), international capital (as opposed to the much smaller national bourgeoisie ) and most of the printed media and all of the broadcast media A cacophony of clamour to stop Brexit by hook or by crook has steadily grown and the court case is merely a part of this No one can now predict where this goes The prime minister s efforts to force a new election to change the parliamentary arithmetic seems doomed to fail Thanks to the fixed term parliaments act two thirds of MPs have to vote for an early election The opposition cry simultaneously Tories Out and Tories In by virtue of their refusal to allow an election Ably assisted by the Speaker of the House the rebels are now in charge of the parliament and can, for now, do as they will They may force Johnson or a replacement non partisan prime minster to seek an extension which by the terms of the Benn Burt Bill can be at the pleasure of the EU as to its duration Or they may drunk on success seek to revoke Article 50 altogether and remove the clock thus effectively returning the whole matter to the status quo ante But the people of England have not spoken yet Wales voted for Brexit, Scotland did not But England voted overwhelmingly for Brexit The political class are counting on ennui wearing down the Brexit 17 4 million by the passage of time and literally years of scaremongering Project Fear My own experience in the Midlands and the North (I spend my weekends in one or the other) suggests that this whole series of betrayals has hardened resolve rather than weakened it My own feeling is that the electorate will exact a terrible vengeance on the politicians when the time finally comes to face them And that if they fail even then, Britain and British democracy will never be the same again And I don t mean that in a good way A terrible beauty may be born",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/469574-boris-johnson-supreme-court-brexit/

Just 51 miles of border fencing has been built since Trump took office 30 months ago, and the steel bollard fencing constructed during that time has merely replaced existing fencing in dilapidated designs, ù according to Customs and Border Protection This hasn t stopped Trump from claiming at campaign rallies that his administration has built a lot of ù the wall, or trying to convince his adoring public to swap their chants of build that wall ù for finish that wall, ù but the mission accomplished ù rhetoric has found few takers among Trump s base I guess@realDonaldTrumpis too chicken to call@DRUDGEa wacky nutjob pic twitter com/a5WApdv0dq Disaffected Trump voters took to Twitter toslamthe president for surrounding himself with mass immigration zealots ù and regular Republican Koch Brotherstypes ù George Soros loves it when he sees conservative Americans cheering for legal immigration, ù another usertweeted, invoking the favorite bogeyman of the Right Former Never Trumper Matt Schlapp to Trump Voters: Drop Dead! my business needs sky high levels of immigrationhttps: // tdotco /6ivg5EZfsZ The #Resistance couldn t miss an opportunity to get in a few kicks while Trump was down, mockinglyexplainingthe difference between replaced ù and built ù The only wall you ve built is the one between you and reality, ù one usertweeted A brief Twitter history of all Trump s lies about the wall: It s necessary It s effective It s easy Mexico will pay Americans should pay Other presidents wanted it It s concrete It s steel It s a fence It s a barrier It s already builtDid I miss anything?

"5 Jul, 2019",Gangster mayors and oligarch s dirty money: Will former criminals hold on to power in Ukraine?,"As Ukraine braces for an early parliamentary vote, its political elites are desperately looking for ways to forge alliances that would be of benefit in the new political environment Some deals, however, look shadier than others While Ukraine s major political parties led by former President Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are preparing to face off, as well as the newly formed party of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a parliamentary election, some political figures with a long criminal history also want a piece of the pie One of the leaders of the newlyformed Opposition Bloc who made it to the top of its election list, Gennady Trukhanov, appears to have a particularly gruesome criminal history behind him Since 2014, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odessa Ukraine s largest port and the third most populous city He is a political veteran who has been building his career in Ukraine s upper echelons of power for about a decade and a half Yet, his fine appearance hides the fact that he was once a member of a notorious gang which was allegedly involved in smuggling arms and drugs According to a 2018 BBCreport, the gang, which came into being in the 1990s, was linked to some particularly gruesome murders Trukhanov, who is involved in martial arts and has been thepresidentof the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation of Muay Thai since 2003, trained members of the gang in hand to hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons, ùthe BBC said, citing data from Italian police A reportcompiledby Italian law enforcement in the late 1990s names Trukhanov as one of the leaders of the gang who had extensive contacts with Ukrainian law enforcement He was also said to enjoy close ties with another gang leader a notorious crime lord called Aleksandr Angert, aka Sasha Angel Angert was sentenced to 15 years in prison for premeditated murder in 1980, but was released 10 years later as he was allegedly suffering from stomach cancer, which, however, apparently did not stop him from taking a leading role in another gang along with Trukhanov Later, Angert, one of Odessa s most influential crime lords, moved to London, where he has lived ever since and allegedly moved from crime to business, dissolving his gangs However, he reportedlyretainedhis close ties with his now business partner Trukhanov The criminal turned mayor, meanwhile, apparently did not wipe the slate clean after moving away from gang activities A 2016reportby the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), citing the Panama Papers, revealed that the mayor owns an entire business empire in Ukraine controlled through offshore firms registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is actively involved in embezzlement and money laundering Another Opposition Bloc leader who found his way to the top of the election list is Gennady Kernes, the longstanding mayor of Kharkov For about two decades, he has ruled over the nation s second most populous city (almost 1 5 million people), also a large industrial and science center He managed to retain his post through a range of political cataclysms, from the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought Yushchenko to power, to the 2014 Maidan coup He has, however, a few skeletons in the closet According to an extensivereportpublished by an investigative media project called Criminal Ukraine the now respectable mayor started his career in the 1990s as a fraudster, whose gang ran several shady schemes Eventually, they decided to expand ùtheir business ùand move from fraud to blackmail and extortion Kernes gang was even suspected of murder at one point, but those charges were apparently not proven Eventually, Kernes (nicknamed Gepa) was arrested, but only sentenced to three years in prison, and was set free two years later due to active repentance ùFollowing his release, the future mayor turned to privatization and managed to obtain quite a number of assets in Kharkov, including factories and real estate, through shady schemes, eventually emerging as a wealthy businessman ù Later, he allegedly used his influence to exert pressure on his political rivals and to gag journalists who dared to mention his criminal past in their reports Kharkov Region is located right next to the tumultuous Eastern Ukrainian regions, parts of which refused to recognize Kiev s authority following the 2014 Maidan coup and declared themselves the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics (DPR and LPR) As Kiev still struggles to regain control over the rebellious Donbass republics, having people like Kernes and Trukhanov at the helm of the regional governments will hardly give it much legitimacy in the eyes of the people there Other Ukrainian media reports suggest that Kernes enjoys close ties to controversial Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who is suspected by some of being the real puppet master behind Zelensky s recent landslide victory in the presidential election KernesvisitedKolomoisky in Israel ahead of the presidential runoff, according to one such report The billionaire dismissed the idea of any hidden agenda ùbehind the trip, telling the media that Kernes went to Israel for medical reasons ùand met him by coincidence Kolomoisky, an oligarch who made a fortune during the privatization frenzy in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, might yet turn out to be the one pulling the strings in the newly formed political bloc A sort of Ukrainian George Soros, Kolomoisky gained a reputation of being a shadowy figure seeking to influence politics Unlike Soros, he does not seem to have any particular ideological preference Instead, he apparently tries to place his millions on the winning horse Over the last decade and a half, he has supported the Orange Revolution, former President Viktor Yushchenko, and then Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko He attained particular infamy in the wake of the Maidan coup, when he created his own paramilitary force bysponsoringanti Russia battalions Kolomoisky initially financed the notorious ultranationalist Azov Battalion for months in 2014 He is now reportedly one of the major backers of the Opposition Bloc He does not really hide this fact either In May, headmittedhe was consulting ùthe party created by Trukhanov and Kernes, which he called an All Ukrainian project ùHe also held talks with a leader of another party that eventually joined the bloc We have common issues The commercial and political ones, ùhe told Ukrainian Pravda back then, adding that some unsuccessful projects need a reboot ùThe billionaire specifically mentioned aligning ùforces and creating a broader ùagenda as a recipe for moving forward Kernes then rushed todownplaythe oligarch s influence on his party by saying that he neither financed nor consulted ùthe party, while calling his contacts with Kolomoisky a private matter ù As Zelensky s presidential victory clearly shows that Ukrainians have grown tired of the old political ways, tainted by corrupt elites linked to organized crime, he has apparently embraced the idea of rebranding and renewal at least on the surface Whether the dark past will still loom over the bright future they claim to offer remains to be seen

"25 Jun, 2019",Soros & US billionaires call for new wealth tax; public reacts with instinctive skepticism,"A group of US billionaires including infamous financier George Soros is backing a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest 01%, echoing several Democratic candidates proposals Somehow, Americans don t trust them Polls show that a moderate tax on the wealthiest Americans enjoys the support of a majority of Americans Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, the group of 20 billionaires, including Soros, his son Alexander, the Pritzker, Gund, and Disney families, and the elusive Anonymous, wrote in aletterpublished by the New York Times on Monday While acknowledging that major policies seldom come to pass without the prior support of wealthy elites or other wealthy interests, the billionaires made the case that taxing the rich would benefit everyone by bankrolling solutions to our climate crisis, infrastructure improvements, public health solutions, and wiping out student loan debt Why, it would even strengthen American freedom and democracy, the billionaires gush A tax of $ 02 per dollar on assets over $50 million and an additional $ 01 per dollar on assets over $1 billion would generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over ten years, the would be philanthropists report, lending their endorsement to Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren s wealth tax plan while denying they back her or any of the other wealth tax supporting Democrats they name in the letter And while they name check Pete Buttigieg and Beto O Rourke as backing the policy too important to be part of only a few candidates platforms, they explicitly avoid mentioning Bernie Sanders The letter s publication on the same day Sanders proposed paying for the cancellation of $1 6 trillion in student loan debt with taxes on stock trades, bonds, and derivatives i e Wall Street transactions that can t be hidden in offshore bank accounts, donated to family charities, or otherwise concealed via the tried and true methods of America s richest families in his College for All Act may have been a coincidence, but his omission from the approved candidate list struck some people as odd Nor is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s suggestion of walloping a larger swath of America s wealthiest anyone earning over $10 million annually with a 70 percent tax rate mentioned You do know you re free to stop taking all those tax write offs and also free to write the govt a big, fat check this very minute? IRS even has a handy address to send it to You do know that? Nearly every social media response was suspicious of the billionaires motives, sincerity, or both Reasoning there s no such thing as a free lunch, or free money, they pointed out that Soros and his ilk didn t get fabulously wealthy by helping the less fortunate As several Twitter users pointed out, nothing is stopping Soros and his peers from overpaying their taxes now, and why would wealthy families that have avoided paying their fair share of every other tax choose to pay this one? Plug the loopholes and find the money that they ve stashed in family trusts and in countries hidden from taxes, one usersuggested Soros, like many of the world s superrich, donated $18 billion to his own Open Society Foundation in 2017, leaving him with only $8 billion to his name, and other hugely wealthy families from the Rockefellers to the Rothschilds have similarly spread their money around in self directed foundations and charities We don t need a wealth tax, we just need them to pay their fair share like the rest of us do Others focused more on their distrust for Soros, whose political meddling on behalf of left wing causes has earned him the hatred of conservatives and whose history of currency manipulation (not for nothing is he called the man who broke the Bank of England ) has earned him the distrust of everyone else Stop using taxes to control the people, one useradmonishedhim, while anothersnarked If you believe this guy, he s probably got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you U don t need permission to pay more taxes Spooky Dude who wants to destroy our country Former Obama Secretary of Labor Robert Reich was one of the only voices supporting the billionaires plan, tweeting that he couldn t agree more with the idea that a wealth tax is patriotic †Othersqualifiedtheir support by pointing out that this was an intelligent move on behalf of the wealthy if they don t want capitalism to devour itself within the next 20 years Personally, I m investing in guillotines Seems like a growth market ",https://www.rt.com/usa/462606-soros-wealth-tax-billionaires-distrust/

Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda they don t get to continue setting it like the election never happened In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the reduction or lifting of sanctions on Russia by Western powers He may not take any action delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with the IMF and other foreign partners It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review ù multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious de communization ù which banned Soviet symbols in the country Ironically, this push for de communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy The NGOs ùinsist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another red line among their national identity demands Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian?

The answer is probably somewhat Unlike its uber liberal neighbor Sweden, Denmark has reacted to the influx of refugees and migrants with increasing hostility The coalition government made up of the center right Venstre and further right Danish People s Party has passed laws requiring refugees to hand over jewelry and valuables to finance their stay, banned the burqa in public, and planned to ship rejected asylum seekers to an uninhabited island in the Baltic sea If you are unwanted in Danish society, you should not be a nuisance to ordinary Danes, ù Immigration Minister Inger St√∏jberg stated when announcing the island plan They are undesirable in Denmark and they must feel it! ù St√∏jberg has been a key author of her government s anti immigration policies In March 2018, she marked the passing of her 50th anti immigration measure by celebrating with a cake decorated with fruit, the Danish flag, and the number 50 #DanishMinister for#Integration(!) Inger#St√∏jbergis celebrating her 50th tightening of#immigrationrules #classy#trumpingtrumppic twitter com/fD8sTRFUpU The government has also targeted settled immigrants, who it says often live in parallel societies ùLast July, as part of a series of measures aimed at eradicating immigrant ghettos, the government announced tougher criminal penalties, lower benefits, and mandatory integration classes for those living in these neighborhoods Despite the anti immigrant sentiment coming from the Danish government, voters are not so sure The center left Social Democrats are leading in the polls at 25 percent, compared to Venstre s 20 percent and the Danish People s Party s 11 6 percent The Social Democrats have begun to move further right on immigration, and as a result could have plenty of coalition forming opportunities open with the center and center right parties As long as Stram Kurs manage to capture more than two percent of the vote, the party looks set to enter parliament for the first time next month In the runup to the election, the newcomers could push the existing right wing even further right as nationalist party Vox did in Spain recently or siphon the hardline vote away from the Danish People s Party Such a fragmentation of the right was also seen in Spain last month, and ultimately helped left wing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez party consolidate its power in parliament Meanwhile, Paludan and Stram Kurs continue to grab column inches The party also took on board as a candidate a prison guard who Paludan said can offer professional knowledge of the consequences of immigration ù As Paludan builds his anti immigration dream team, next month s elections will reveal whether the Danish electorate still wants to continue the country s rightward shift Asylum applications in Denmark dropped by 84 percent between 2015 and 2018, and without a cohort of immigrants to rail against, a return to centrism is not unlikely ù, ",https://www.rt.com/news/458862-denmark-far-right-election/

two other outlets Co authors Olivia Solon former Guardian scribe of everyone who questions White Helmets is a Russian agent ùfame and Cyrus Farivar say that the documents show Facebook CEO Mark

chief Nicholas Thompson, the article opens with George Soros s2018 denunciationof social media giants in Davos, going on to claim that the world had learned how Russian intelligence operatives used the platform to manipulate US voters ùwhile Genocidal monks in Myanmar and a despot in the Philippines had taken a liking to the platform ù CNN s Brian Stelter later shared a link to the story, along with a quote about how Facebook executives supposedly rejoiced at pain ùof news sites losing traffic on the platform According to multiple Facebook employees, a handful of executives considered it a small plus, too, that the news industry was feeling a little pain after all its negative coverage The pain being reduced traffic to news websites https: // tdotco /obX39jQihH The day before, ABC

"27 Mar, 2019",America s cult of liberal privilege lets Jussie Smollett dodge felony bullet,"Instead of facing charges for staging a hate crime, Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett is free without so much as a slap on the wrist Welcome to the world of liberal privilege, where criminals enjoy full immunity before the law Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge As March madness continues to get madder by the day, it is becoming clear that the United States is not just a country being torn apart by two irreconcilably different ideologies, liberalism and conservatism It is a country where its inhabitants increasingly reside inside of fenced off, heavily guarded parallel realities Whereas the one half is governed by the rule of law and tradition, the other half is guided by raw emotion and hysterical claims of victimhood The case of Jussie Smollett should make it clear which of those realities is gaining the upper hand Just days after Robert Mueller wrapped up his years long investigation of Donald Trump, which exonerated the president of any collusion with Russia, Jussie Smollett also received his share of good news But that is where the similarities between the two public figures come to a screeching halt Whereas Trump had received non stop, politically fueled abuse from the media since the moment Mueller started his 675 day inquisition, Smollett got kid glove treatment from the very same media, despite the extremely disturbing nature of his charges For the uninitiated, Smollett wasarrestedfor filing a false police report a Class 4 felony with regards to an attack on his person The Empire star said he was the victim of an assault in Chicago in January, in which two white men allegedly beat him, doused him with bleach, and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene In addition to hurling racist and homophobic slurs, the men according to Smollett yelled Make America Great Again comments ù in the course of the attack That sounds more like a cheap rendition of the 1988 Hollywood film Mississippi Burning than your average winter in Illinois The takeaway point here is that Mr Smollett orchestrated an actual hate crime based on a volatile cocktail that mixed up race and politics By appealing to the brutal savagery of America s pre civil rights past, complete with allusions to public lynchings, Smollett was attempting to connect Trump supporters to those historic acts of severe racism That is about as sick and deranged as it gets Worse, however, is that this rash and reckless stunt relied upon a reverse form of racism after all, it is not just whites who are always guilty of racism that worked to aggravate racial tensions that are always smoldering just below the pavement Can Michael Flynn get some of the Jussie Smollett privilege?A decorated war hero was entrapped by the feds and now faces $5 million in legal fees for a meaningless process crimeMeanwhile Jussie committed 16 felonies and gets off totally cleanThis is a total injustice Another disturbing part of the fake news story was how so manypeople especially in the Democratic establishment willingly rushed to Smollett s defense before any real investigation had commenced On that point, would any scandal in America be complete without dropping the name of George Soros? And yes, there does seem to be a connection It has been reported that Soros donated $408,000 in 2016 to a super PAC that supported State Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office prosecuted î and dropped î the Jussie Smollett case, ù Breitbartreported †It has even beensuggested, following the release of emails, that Foxx agreed to intervene in the Smollett case on behalf of his family @JussieSmollettis one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know I m praying for his quick recovery This was an attempted modern day lynching No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin We must confront this hate But let s forget about the billionaire interloper for now The purpose here is to consider the question of justice when it comes to such incidences The conservatives like to argue that those who inhabit the left side of the political tracks always seem to have a get out of jail free card at the crucial moment, while those on the political right must suffer the full brunt of the media industrial complex A good example of this mediabiasoccurred in January when a group of students from Covington Catholic High School traveled to Washington DC to partake in a protest During their trip, words were exchanged between them and members of an obscure religious group At this point, Nathan Phillips, a Native American, walked between the two groups in an apparent effort to defuse the tensions He approached Covington student, Nick Sandmann, as he continued to beat on a ceremonial drum What happened next is already well known Phillips and Sandmann, aggressively sporting a red MAGA cap, engaged in what appeared to be a cold stare down between the two The media, without doing much research into the matter, jumped to the conclusion that Sandmann and his fellow students were taunting the Indian elder, when, as it later transpired through a video, nothing of the sort had happened Now the Washington Post isfacinga $250 million lawsuit for its mishandling of the story Was Sandmann s grave offense in the eyes of the media being white, Catholic and a Trump supporter? Meanwhile, Smollett s total exoneration should really not come as a surprise The trend up until this time points to the fact that liberals have acquired a super sort of immunity when it comes to their behavior, even criminal behavior The climate of political correctness seems to have given liberals a body armor that repels any accusations made against them In what other period, for example, could a celebrity hold aloft a severed head effigy of the American president for a promotional photo shoot, as the so called comedianKathy Griffindid, and not suffer any legal consequences? In fact, Griffincontinuesto play the victim card since pulling the stunt Then there was the moment when pop queen Madonnatolda crowd of rapturous fans that she has thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House ù However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel Although Jussie Smollett is a free man today, avoiding a lengthy prison term that would have been a certain fate for anyone else, there are signs of anger with the decision, even inside of the Democratic camp Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, for example, called the ruling, a whitewash of justice ù At the same time, the Chicago Police Union, which invested a lot of manpower and money into solving the non crime, iscallingfor a federal investigation of the incident While the liberals seem to enjoy a sort of invincibility when it comes to some of their more bizarre antics, with no small help from a left leaning media that supports their every stupid stunt, the tide may be slowly turning against them In that sense, the liberals may possibly be saved from themselves",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/454911-liberal-privilege-jussie-smollett/
"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary s FM: We didn t get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People s Party, the center right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps: //soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation ss: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news So, the bloc of the centre right parties in the European Parliament, the European People s Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? ps: Look, because Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the European Union as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that s why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs And our position is a very strong anti migration position, which is not shared by many And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements So that s why this is the core of the conflict ss: That s where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you re saying it s much larger of a spectrum, not just centre right, because we get an impression that it s a center right bloc Ok, so that makes sense ps: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament And if you, let s say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you And we have to be honest, European People s Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be ss: So, this suspension happened, took place The head of your Prime Minister s office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP What s going on right now? ps: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People s Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let s put it this way And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP ss: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn t take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote ps: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself ss: So that means, that if it wasn t voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? ps: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow ss: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend ps: Yeah We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing ss: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? ps: No no no We shouldn t confuse the party issue with, let s say, institutional questions The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the European Union, like a cash machine, you know, and don t take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair ss: So you re saying the payouts are not under threat? ps: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well So it s a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long lasting debate or legal procedure ss: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti migrant policy that your country s leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we ve all seen Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? ps: No, no definitely not Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that s going to be the case in the future as well And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don t want that to happen So it s a debate with him, an open debate He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him And my question is, why shouldn t a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary ss: Okay, so let s see how the forces could be re arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro EU, and now it s kind of siding with Italy against Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? ps: Look, I don t think it s fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the European Union ss: Integration, let s put it this way ps: Yeah, yeah, right There s a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward And there are definitely at least two different camps One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels We think it s a dead end street We think this is a bad concept We think that this will not strengthen European Union What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro European position, as we think that the way towards a strong European Union leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong So the debate is rather about that, and that s why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong European Union, but we think that ss: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it s not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you re all part of European Union, you want to be part of European Union, but, like you said, there s definitely two camps One is super pro integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro stronger state and a formal Brussels, let s put it this way So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you ve suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? ps: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we ll see how we go forward But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro migration body And this is something that we don t like ss: So you re leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU s border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation This is a serious accusation ps: These are facts, basically ss: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? ps: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border Let s look at the Internet, at what they have said You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it s not a border protection unit They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together But protecting the entire border to the South of the European Union with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn t know what he or she speaks about We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended ss: Ok, so I m going to play a little bit of devil s advocate, and I m going to tell you what the opposite side is saying The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they re saying it s ludicrous, and it s a conspiracy theory, and they re actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you re not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it s under threat? I just want to hear that ps: Whether the borders are under threat? ss: Do you feel like you re not in control of your own border? ps: We are in control That s why we have built the fence That s why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis A number of them So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border But, you know, it s really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together We think it s a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states ss: So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered ps: Absolutely ss: That s your country as well ps: But this cannot be our country It s physically excluded ss: OK But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary ps: But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary either Greece or Greece and Croatia Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, was that we registered them, and the Greek didn t But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one ss: Another thing Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? ps: Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament Then we don t know the composition of that We don t know the composition of the European Commission So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the European Union, what we see is a huge set of double standards Why? Take the example of Poland The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made They completed all of them from A to Z And what European Commission has done was saying Äúoh, it s not enough, we continue the procedure Äù instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations ss: So I want to talk a little about Hungary s stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that s something that your country speaks very strongly about For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the European Union If that happens, if the pro immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? ps: No, absolutely not That s not in question ss: So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe s population was Muslim And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far fetched, no? He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different ps: Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti anything So we are not anti Muslim We are not anti anything We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent You know, it s unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn t be the case Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo Christian heritage, with its Christian culture And in this regard, I think it s very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate ss: I know you don t like Frontex, but I m still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? ps: You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the European Union, mostly in the Southern and Southern Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe I was in Jordan recently The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom Lebanon the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there The last time the Turkish President has complained about the European Union not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU Turkey deal on migration As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats they ll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing I mean, on the level of European Union, we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the European Union is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe ss: Okay, I get your point Now to a different topic the Russian led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans What s the calculus behind it? What s the logic? ps: Look, now the situation started to change So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute IIB s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension So new and modern investments are happening in the country We are looking for financial background So IIB s involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us ss: But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank It s a normal, usual practice with this international institutions But the Western commentators are saying that actually it s a great base for Russia s intelligence services to operate from What do you say to that? ps: You know, I think I surprised these commentators, including the Hungarian opposition, when I ask them whether they know that five out of the nine owners of this bank are NATO member states Period ss: Thank you very much It s been great pleasure talking to you Good luck with everything ps: Thank you for the invitation again Good being here",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/454459-hungarian-fm-peter-szijjarto/

"2 Jan, 2019",Tommy Robinson and the impact of the super rich on UK politics,"Over the last few years Tommy Robinson has gone from being a marginal character in the far right to a prominent figure with over one million Facebook followers He s also supported with lavish donations in the UK and overseas Editor s note: The original text of this article has been changed to more accurately reflect what public tax records show about the financial relations between a fund headed by Nina Rosenwald and the charities investigated by the Guardian for their ties with Tommy Robinson Taking into account comments by legal representatives of Ms Rosenwald, alterations have been made concerning the funding of the Middle East Forum and the regularity of articles published by the Gatestone Institute in support of Tommy Robinson It s hard to think of anyone else that has so rapidly gone from being a convicted football thug to a worldwide known political figure Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, set up the extreme right Islamophobic English Defence League back in 2009 He has always denied being a racist and claims he does not worry about the colour of someone s skin But he is strongly opposed to Islamist ideology, although he claims not to be opposed to Muslims as people This claim was undermined when he was recorded on film saying Somalis are backward barbarians, and British Muslims are enemy combatants who want to kill you, maim you and destroy you The film also shows him claiming that refugees are raping their way through the country In 2017 Robinson began campaigning against what he called grooming gangs, appearing outside the courts and denouncing the defendants because of their religion and warning that their abuse had been covered up He was arrested for contempt of court, and within just one day 20,000 in donations were raised to support him The following year Robinson was arrested again outside a court in Leeds, for contempt of court, after placing a live video on Facebook about a child exploitation trial He was briefly jailed, and while his case was appealed his supportersstageda mass demonstration in London in July that turned violent It was the largest right wing demonstration since the 1970s and it wasfundedby a think tank in the US called Middle East Forum One of the activists present was Avi Yemini who denounced Islam as a barbaric ideology and claimed it had taken over England Another speaker was CarlBenjaminwho was revealed to have sent the Labour MP Jess Phillips a tweet threatening rape Benjamin has over 880,000 YouTube subscribers and has posted videos denouncing not just Islam but feminism He has now enrolled as a member of UKIP Although Robinson depicts himself as a mere underdog whose campaign against Islam has been suppressed by the establishment, he is now receiving more funding from right wing groups than anyone else in Britain His growing prominence led to him being appointed as an official adviser to the UKIP party by its leader Gerard Batten, who supported the Westminster demo In response its previous, and immensely popular leader, Nigel Farageresignedfrom the party after 25 years of active support, along with other prominent members The dramatic rise of Robinson from a marginal far right fringe to now being followed by millions across the world shows the worrying growth of the far right in current politics He is now getting financial support from think tanks in the USA and Australia This was revealed following an investigation by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, commissioned by the Guardian newspaper, that forty percent of the tweets supporting Robinson came from the US as opposed to only thirty percent from the UK Others were also flooding in from Holland, Canada and nine other countries Robinson admits he has received several hundred thousand pounds in donations, but the Guardianinvestigationraised disturbing issues about the groups funding him The US think tank Middle East Forum admits it has given $60,000 to support his legal fees and the London demo The Guardian also reported that the Middle East Forum, as well as other groups that have supported Robinson, have themselves received nearly $5 million from several wealthy donors Among them is the Abstraction Fund, of which New York department store heiress Nina Rosenwald is president and treasurer The fundgavethe Middle East Forum $2 65 million in donations between 2011 and 2015 Rosenwald is also the president of the Gatestone Institute, which has published a number of articles about Robinson and has received generous donations from the Abstraction Fund Gatestone is also supported by the family of Robert Mercer, a hedge fund boss who was a key funder of Donald Trump s presidential campaign The foundations of Richard Mellon Scaife, the late billionaire who donated generously to conservative causes, gave $575,000 to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which frequently runs articles supporting Robinson The idea that American billionaires can impact on our politics in any way is profoundly wrong and the UK government should pass a law to ban all foreign funding in our domestic politics Two of the richest Americans, David and Charles Koch, who are worth $120 billion have not been seen before to be funding organisations in Britain but the Guardian s George Monbiotrevealedon December 7 that the Charles Koch Foundation had transferred money to a company that appears to be the US funding arm of a British organisation funding a magazine called Spiked The politics of Charles Koch were revealed back in 1978 when he wrote: Our movement must destroy the prevalent statist paradigm He argues for lower taxes and deregulating businesses, yet his own company has faced massive fines for illegal emissions, ammonia pollution and oil spills The company was found guilty in 1999 of using a corroded pipeline carrying butane which exploded and killed two people The Koch brothers set up the Mercatus Centre, the Cato Institute and Americans For Prosperity and over the years they have spent hundred of millions of dollars supporting those organisations that share their right wing views They provided vital support for the Tea Party but then moved on to support Trump by funding his transition team Not surprisingly Trump s administration has dramatically reduced taxes on large corporations such as those owned by the Koch brothers In the last two years the Charles Koch Foundation gave $300,000 to support Spiked which has denounced George Soros, Jeremy Corbyn and Black Lives Matter It also denounced those campaigning for feminism and environmental issues It provides strong support for the far right columnist Katie Hopkins, Tommy Robinson, Aaron Banks, Toby Young and Viktor Orban (Hungary s right wing prime minister) It has consistently supported a hard Brexit without a deal It s not illegal for Tommy Robinson to be getting funding from non British political organisations but it could have a major impact on British politics Robinson is a hard line supporter of Brexit and Britain remains deeply divided on this crucial issue If Robinson has enough money to mobilise his supporters to increase pressure on MPs to leave Europe without a deal the consequences for our economy could be severely damaging and lead to a surge of support for the far right as unemployment increases following Brexit In the last ten years the thousand richest families in Britain have seen their wealth double while working class and middle class families have struggled to cope with savage cuts in services, and wages not keeping up with inflation The same has happened in the USA and across the world, giant corporations have seen their profits continue to grow It s no surprise that the super rich are spending hundreds of millions to influence government policies and it s time that we campaign to force our governments to make this illegal, and supporting figures like Tommy Robinson needs to be stopped ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/447939-tommy-robinson-support-us-billionaire/

Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others But the debate requires much more than moral appeals ù A recentstudyentitled Building Walls puts the growth of EU internal and external border barriers into stark perspective In the 1990s, there were two border walls Now the number has grown to a total of 17, with most of the structures built over the past three years Ten countries out of 28 EU member states have built physical barriers to control migrants entering from outside the bloc They include Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Latvia The authors of the above report call the structures edifices of fear ù and make the startling comparison to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany until its dismantlement in 1989 EU states have built border barriers equivalent to the length of six Berlin Walls The report also reproaches the proliferation of mental walls ù across EU member states with the rise of what it calls far right ù and racist ù political parties There are now, it is claimed, 10 EU states in which xenophobic ù parties have significant government or parliamentary representation However, the problem with a report like this is that it provides no practical solutions to the immense political and social challenges stemming from phenomenal migration The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that a record number of 68 5 million people worldwide are forcibly on the move from their origins, many of them trying to reach Europe We can perhaps agree that in recent years that the EU has faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake Civil society and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443776-migratns-poverty-war-eu-soros/

At this point, I would like to say that, as an American, it is difficult to fathom how the question of a strong border has become such a political football The United States has a very fair system for allowing people to become naturalized citizens, and asylum seekers are accorded all the protections mandated by the law The only requirement is that migrants follow the legal procedures for entry, and if that sounds like a radical or xenophobic idea, as many Liberals today seem to believe, then the majority of countries in the world would have to be classified as racist Somehow the US went from being an ethnically diverse country comprised of law abiding immigrants, to a nation that thinks it s alright to accept law breaking border jumpers as future citizens In times past, before the age of virtue signaling, social justice warriors and PC dementia was all the rage, a group of undocumented people storming the US border would have been dealt with in the appropriate manner, and without any questions asked Today, however, many Western governments have been infected by the globalist creed, Merkel style, that says it is the duty of Western democracies to let oppressed migrants into their countries en masse and unmolested Meanwhile, it is the migrants who areportrayedas heroes in the Western media, while the people who want to defend their borders are some sort of knuckle dragging xenophobes In the case of the European Union, countries that fight back against the concept of loose borders, like Hungary, for example, are treated like pariah states, even suffering severe disciplinary action The situation is so grave and arouses so many different emotions that the issue of borders actually has the power to break up the West into two camps the nationalists on one side and the globalists on the other When one looks a bit deeper at the situation, the Liberal desire to accept migrants with open arms is dripping with hypocrisy and not a little blood After all, if the Democrats (and Republicans) really wanted to address the problem of mass migration at the root they would be out on the streets demanding that their governments cease and desist from waging war on sovereign states That is the real reason why so many people are fleeing their homes for a new life military aggression It s a national embarrassment that a group of illegal immigrants can cross our border and receive free healthcare/benefits, while veterans that have served this country are put on a waiting list Even tiny Honduras is no stranger to such violence This is something the Democrats should understand given former president Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton s botched efforts toinfluencethe Honduras military coup of 2009 In fact, that event, which brought to power a far right strongman, Pepe Lobo Sosa, goes far at explaining the caravan now ascending upon the US border In short, if the West would simply stop pursuing war and chaos around the world, much of which is based on avarice and empire building, the question of stronger borders would no longer be an issue, and those innocent people now in the firing line of NATO armies could rest easily knowing they can build prosperous lives in their own countries",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442423-migrants-caravan-midterms-crisis/

"25 Jun, 2018","Atlantic Council finally admits Ukraine s Nazi problem, and seems upset RT reported it earlier","RT has accurately and consistently chronicled the rise of neo Nazism in Ukraine Now, rather belatedly, NATO s principal mouthpiece has finally joined in, throwing some bizarre shade at this network in the process Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv KRASNODAR For the uninitiated, the Atlantic Council is NATO s propaganda wing And whenever its lobbyists, or guest writers, publish opinions which digress from the standard Washington foreign policy establishment position, it usually suggests a change in attitude is on the cards Last week, the think tank ù sent Ukraine a clear message: get your extremists & neo Nazis under control promptly and start taking the threat they pose seriously In doing so, the Atlantic Council also finallyacknowledgedthe problem exists Something readers and viewers of RT have been aware of since the first Euromaidan protests back in 2013 However, for years, this reportage was dismissed by pro NATO activists as Kremlin propaganda ù So what has changed? Well, Ukraine s far right has become so emboldened that even the countries biggest defenders are beginning to realize the threat they pose to the narrative established since the 2014 change of power in Kiev For instance, just this weekend near the western city of Lvov, a member of the Roma community was murdered during a pogrom Additionally, others were stabbed, including an eight year old child Amid total impunity, Roma pogroms in Ukraine have now become deadly Another Roma settlement in Lviv, biggest city of Western Ukraine, attacked overnight: one person is killed, many stabbed Police detains 7 people, considers to open the investigation Farther eastwards, in the capital Kiev, for some months now, aneo Nazi militiahas been imposing its own order †with street patrols Meanwhile, the legal authorities either offer tacit approval or are helpless to stop Azov or perhaps a mixture of both While all this sounds like something from a history book, documenting the time of Hitler, Franco, and Mussolini, it s the reality in Europe s second largest country today And it s clear that the mainstream media simply won t be able to ignore the situation for much longer Indeed, even American state broadcaster RFE/RL hasconcededthat Azov s induction ceremonies are more reminiscent of 1930s Germany than of postwar democracy, ùas they include nationalist chants, raised fists, and a torchlight march through central Kyiv* (sic) ù But has the horse bolted? Many experts think so Ivan Katchanovski, a Ukrainian emigre professor in Canada, has consistently warned of the dangers of appeasing ultra nationalists This weekend, hetweeted: far right violence became normalized and mainstream in Ukraine following their crucial role in violent attacks during Maidan, (the) Maidan and Odesa (sic) massacres, war in Donbas & political assassinations But Western governments and media chose to deny and ignore this Now it is too late ù His view is supported by Tarik Cyril Amar of Columbia University Timing mattered enormously: in 2014 Ukraine needed the West urgently The West was engaged, rightly, but not as, literally, invested as now That was the moment, obviously, not to let the far right infiltration tactics pass, ù he wrote That was also the moment when western intellectuals signed a letter to do precisely that because: wartime emergency, Russian info war, blablabla And that was the tip of the iceberg To all those who joined what Andreas Umland later proudly called the fencing season for the right: congrats You now know how it feels to be a fellow traveler (sic) ù That was also the moment when western intellectuals signed a letter to do precisely that because: wartime emergency, Russian info war, blablabla And that was the tip of the iceberg Thus, Atlantic Council s volte face is timely But one wonders why the editor chose the title: Ukraine s Got a Real Problem with Far Right Violence (And No, RT Didn t Write This Headline) ù Because it bears no relation to the writer Josh Cohen s text, in which he doesn t mention this network at all My guess is the pressure group feels it has tripped over itself here Because for some years now, it has been attempting to present everything RT reports as inadmissible, owing to its fears that Russian media threatens the dominance of the Western establishment press, which is overwhelmingly pro NATO And like all true believers, Atlantic Council lobbyists don t tolerate dissent Yet, the simple fact remains: RT reported on Ukraine s Nazi problem when mainstream outlets deliberately ignored this reality Back in October of 2014, Iwrote: If it walks like a Nazi and quacks like a Nazi it s the far right, ù adding when correspondents in Kiev see Nazis, they report only the presence of far right nationalists, a far more palatable term Welcome to the bizarre world of Western media in Ukraine A self contained pit of rumor, fear, braggadocio and propaganda ù Earlier that month, Ipublished A journalist s duty is to inform: have western press forgotten this in Ukraine? ù Again, questioning why journalists refused to report the facts After this, for challenging their groupthink, many of the Western hack pack unfollowed or blocked me on Twitter: the modern form of journalistic ostracism In May of last year, as the far right became even more visible, Iaskedwhy western reporters in Kiev continue to ignore the rise of Neo Nazism in Ukraine And five months later, I noted the lack of press coverage after up to 20,000 far right radicals honored the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) a paramilitary group led by Stepan Bandera, which actively collaborated with Hitler s Germany They brandished lit torches, smoke pellets, and flares as they chanted fascist slogans And some participants openly gave Nazi salutes during the rally ù So, readers of my columns, and of RT s work in general, have been well aware of Ukraine s Nazi problem while consumers of Western media are generally blissfully ignorant, as it has largely turned a blind eye Yet, the Atlantic Council routinely calls for restrictions on RT Indeed, only last autumn, itwantedthis network to be †listed as a foreign agent in the United States: a move which was clearly coordinated with policymakers because, within weeks, the wish was granted Furthermore, a month later itdismissedRT as a Low Grade Platform for Useful Idiots ù READ MORE: Useful idiots?

John Bosnitch:This verdict was anticipated even before the court was formed During the civil war in Bosnia, the European powers, which were backing the Muslim and the Croat side, were calling General Ratko Mladic a war criminal even before the court was formed to try him He was never given a presumption of innocence even from the first day RT:Then are you surprised that the trial lasted as long as it did? JB:If you are going to try people in full, it sometimes takes quite a lot of time to do it You draw the trial out, you let both sides appear to have a fair trial; you let them present the evidence; you disregard the evidence that shows that the accused party is innocent; you refer only to the evidence that is proven in many documents to be untrue and then you convict him What we have here is not a delivery of justice through a lengthy and detailed trial but a very complicated and purposely drawn out show trial to keep the name of General Mladic in the news for the best part of a decade and to thus demonize the entire Serbian people RT:Mladic was accused of crimes against humanity This is a very high profile case Are you confident that all of those who committed such crimes during the war in Yugoslavia have been brought before the tribunal? JB:The point is that the tribunal was a one sided tool of the NATO powers The purpose of the tribunal was to find one side guilty, and that was the Serbian side, because they were accused of being war criminals long before the court was formed There is no surprise about the way it was done What is surprising is that anyone, anywhere expected even the slightest chance that General Mladic might be acquitted That, I am sure, no normal rational person could have expected Not because he is guilty but because he was determined to be found guilty even before the first witness presented any evidence So as long as the public knows that there was no other possible verdict even if the man was innocent, then that s fine The NATO powers have had their show trial; we have had the media reports upon it We know that the media, especially the mainstream media, which pushed this case, were described by the US president as the lying mainstream media Another lie was perpetrated through the means of the court and the media The war was promoted by the West The West pushed the Muslims into the war, provided them with weapons, backed them through the war and the lying media delivered the verdict Now we are just doing the autopsy on the death of justice This verdict also creates a potentially dangerous precedent as it could be used by the US to justify future invasions launched without any internationally approved mandate, international affairs commentator Marko Gasic told RT This verdict was necessary primarily for the US, to find someone guilty of genocide is to create yourself a false moral mandate to stop future supposed genocides, ùhe said On the basis of this verdict, the USA will give itself a right to attack anywhere, anytime with its acolytes to [defend] its own interests ù Gasic also said that the Mladic trial was a tribunal financed by the US, Saudi Arabia and George Soros ùAccording to Gasic, it had only one purpose: to achieve the prosecution of a targeted nation the Serbian nation ù",https://www.rt.com/news/410664-mladic-tribunal-verdict-analysts/

Michelle Gross: Not in the least I think this makes the conditions in this country far less safe Because we are not talking about protective gear here, we are talking about things like grenade launchers, militarized vehicles, weaponized vehicles There is nothing about these kinds of devices provided under the 1033 program that would make the community safer I think it is a very dangerous precedent; it is a very bad idea It adds to the level of danger in this country Trying to act on your First Amendment rights, you could get gunned down by military vehicles in the streets of this country I think it is terrible RT:Police in the US are often accused of using excessive force, even brutality How do you think the Trump administration is going to address this issue? MG:He has already shown us that he doesn t intend to address this issue whatsoever In fact, he actually encourages police officers to engage in brutality He did that in a speech before the Fraternal Order of Police He has indicated many times that he frankly doesn t care about people s civil rights I don t think that he has one ounce of interest in warning about people s civil rights He was completely mistaken about the crime levels in this country they are at a 20 year low We don t need militarized police running through the streets with things like grenade launchers and tanks and this kind of business I think it is a grave danger to the civil liberties in this country, and it portrays a government out of control This is not the policing that people want in the community It completely undermines any ability to improve police community relations The things people have been working the last few years, he has literally gutted those And I find that very distressing People in our community do not want to see armed military vehicle rolling down the streets of Minneapolis The militarization of the police will make more problems, in as much as this so called civil unrest is synthetic These groups receive funding from George Soros and other persons, in fact President Obama gave millions of dollars to groups to create this discord So, this isn t an organic conflict between American citizens, but paid actors This is a Deep State or Dark State operation Further militarization of the police want stop people that are paid to be disruptive and violent from doing so †Dr Randy Short, US human rights activist, to RT RT:What reaction do you expect from American society at large? Trump s supporters seem to like his tough on crime stance Will there be support for giving police greater access to military equipment? MG:I think that the support that Trump has clearly you could look at the polls and you can see that he does not have the wide support of the community But more than that, the things that you do have to be based on facts He keeps talking about what a horrible crime problem we have But in fact, violent crime isdownat a 20 yearlow It is ridiculous to militarize the police He asserts that militarizing the police will decrease crime And in fact, it does what it does it increases crime and police brutality We don t think it is a crime reduction mechanism whatsoever And I think that people who look at those kinds of things from a factual basis, not just some sort of imagery, but from a factual basis agree that you do not decrease crime by rolling military vehicles down the street The other thing to think about is this: one of the things that does decrease crime is increased trust within the community, being able to communicate with cops, to able to say they have witnessed things without feeling endangered by doing so These kinds of actions of remilitarizing the police make the community less trustful and therefore law enforcement is a much more dangerous job and a more difficult job I would absolutely assert that it is the opposite of what Trump is saying is going to happen out of this ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/401446-militarizing-police-crimes-brutality/

countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis Mr Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1 It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars Where Mr Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent ù Soros funded groups are only network following mafia ways in Hungary Orbanhttps: // tdotco /NPoXZlq4e3pic twitter com/CsQoLf1Sle The

Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten Germany lost over 6 million men on the

truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey,

sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: Russia s surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr Soros is right to point out that if the European Union carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement That is why the European Union needs to be radically reinvented ù The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self evident detriment of millions of working people It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short term investment as and where the opportunity arises It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08 The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti politics or to be more specific anti politics as usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem Until European governments

"15 Mar, 2017","European headscarf ban won t be imposed on British workers automatically, say lawyers","A European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling allowing employers to ban their workers from wearing any kind of political, philosophical or religious sign ù will not directly apply to the UK The ECJ ruled on Tuesday it would not be considered direct discrimination if an employer banned its workers from wearing religious and political symbols, such as an Islamic headscarf While acknowledging such a ban could constitute indirect discrimination on some instances, the court ruled that such discrimination would be fair if objectively justified by a legitimate aim ùsuch as a company wanting to adopt a neutral policy However, experts have warned if UK employers were to adopt such a ban, they would likely face a barrage of discrimination claims Employers wishing to ban their employees from showing any kind of religious or political affiliation would have to appeal to Europe, and that would take years and be impractical until the UK leaves the EU There is a danger that many UK employers might misread the headlines around this ruling and feel that it is legally OK to ban the wearing of headscarves by those in public facing roles, provided they impose a neutral and across the board ban on all employees, ùsaid Juliet Carp, vice chairman of the Employment Lawyers Association and a partner at Kingsley Napley, speaking to the Times Although the ECJ claimed the ban is only indirect discrimination and therefore potentially legitimate, UK tribunals would be unlikely to rule in its favor, especially given the UK s tolerance and diversity, she added In the UK we have accepted differences î for example Sikh headgear on construction sites and children carrying ceremonial Sikh knives into schools î we tend to be more adaptable ù CMS Cameron McKenna employment partner Anthony Fincham backed this view, saying courts would likely shy away ùfrom giving an absolute ruling and that every verdict would be functional to cases varying dynamics I think our courts would shy away from an absolutist position and we would be left with case by case testing of the employer s reasons, as is consistent with the ruling, ùFincham said, according to the Times However, Jonathan Chamberlain, a partner at UK firm Gowling WLG was reported saying in the Independent that the ECJ s ruling is in line with what the UK has already been practicing for several years For example, it s fine for employers to have a dress code but it needs to be applied with some sensitivity and flexibility to take account of religious beliefs, ùhe said What is almost certainly never OK is for an employer to tell an employee to stop wearing a religious symbol because a particular customer has asked for it ù Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out today in the Commons during PMQs to defend women s †right to †wear a hijab or headscarf, saying that it is †the right of all women to choose how they dress adding it was not for government to dictate what women can and cannot wear Right of all women to choose how they dress, we won t legislate on this issue @theresa_mayon@EUCourtPressBurka ruling We have a strong tradition in this country of freedom of expression, and it is the right of all women to choose how they dress and we don t intend to legislate on this issue You have raised the broader issue of symbols, but of course this case came up particularly in relation to the wearing of the veil, May pointed out There will be times when it is right for a veil to be asked to be removed, such as border security or perhaps in courts, and individual institutions can make their own policies But it is not for Government to tell women what they can and cannot wear, and we want to continue that strong tradition of freedom of expression The ECJ also ruled that the ban would not be justifiable if imposed for customer satisfaction The ruling came after two cases were brought by employees in France and Belgium who had been dismissed for not removing their headscarf, despite it not covering their face While human rights charity Amnesty International welcomed the ruling on the French case that employers are not at liberty to pander to the prejudices of their clients, ùit claimed the ban would open a backdoor to precisely such prejudice ù The ruling faced backlash by a series of human rights organizations and Muslim groups Open Society Justice, which is backed by philanthropist George Soros, said it was disappointed by the ruling In many member states, national laws will still recognise that banning religious headscarves at work is discrimination, ùMaryam Hmadoun, the initiative s policy officer, said, according to the Independent But in places where national law is weak, this ruling will exclude many Muslim women from the workplace ù",https://www.rt.com/uk/380855-religion-work-headscarf-discrimination/

What it is that is so very evil and antithetical to American values, and sense of decency? I m at a loss here While I recoil at Trump s entry ban in that it is humanely questionable and painstakingly pointless since it fails to address the very premise of its purpose: fighting terrorism, I don t accept the tsunami of uber sentimentalism liberals have showered us with Bottom line I don t buy it! The Oval Office did not manifest the list of countries; it recycled the intelligence that Obama s administration put forth and then pulled a Trump on America I find the sudden cries of outrage both hypocritical and ever so conveniently timely From where I m sitting the US did not exactly wait for Mr Trump s arrival to revel in all things Islamophobic And yet today a litany of Hollywood stars and other celebs ùare having a day at the bashing their favorite tangerine pantomime to a nasty pulp @Nigel_Farage&@KTHopkinsvoice their support for@realDonaldTrump s#MuslimBanand want the same for Britain https: // tdotco /ehKJyNUSKt I would personally argue that the United States has not only defined but architected the very industry that is Islamophobia, to the tune of misconceptions, bigoted generalizations, and downright fascist orientalism Here I would say that Mr Trump stands the product of decades of exceptionalism, political arrogance, and intolerant self entitlement Let us remember for a second that President Trump sits in the White House not as conquering sociopath, but an elected official In all fairness, every decision he has so far taken good or bad, has been in keeping with his campaign promises Might it be the Mexican wall, the anti lobby act, or theMuslim ban, Mr Trump has been consistent As his daughter once declared: He says what he means, and he means what he says ù So what gives? Was America expecting Mr Trump to suddenly transform into a Democrat and front liberal policies instead of enacting those he promised his fan base?

We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it s great to have you here on our program, welcome Peter Szijjarto: My pleasure, thank you ss: So, we ll start with the latest: † Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros † I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that How dangerous are those organisations for your country? ps: Actually, there s a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country which is a very dangerous approach, because it s not true There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would ve run, so there were no people voting for I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me People vote on politicians, on political parties So it s the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous number one Number two, you know, there s a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it s not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent So, that s why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments then it should be known to the people ss: Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with local groups despite government s opposition ps: What we say is that they have to be transparent People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics then these people have to know, whom these are representing That s what we want to know ss: Well, who are they? ps: We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary He has a very clear, let s say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn t like our approach, doesn t like our policies But, it s not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it s the Hungarian people We find it very anti democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for ss: But when George Soros says that more than ever he s going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he s going to go against the government s will How s that going to play out? ps: He has a very clear intention, that s definitely true, but I think it s an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence This is what we have heard a lot from the U S for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country So, it s a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors people, persons, businessmen of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves ss: If you re saying you re going after NGOs, you can t just go after Soros funded NGOs, you ll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well Are you ready to do that? ps: My position is that we have to ensure level playing field So, double standards we don t like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by Actually, it s I wouldn t say funny because it s too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter N is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family so, actually, I don t think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non governmental organisation is too much ss: So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country s foreign policy? ps: I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life social, political life of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are ss: But here s a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros funded NGOs, before they came to power so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? ps: Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad in the U S and in the UK But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things ss: Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe do you think with him in the office it s going to be easier for Hungary to get rid of these Soros foundation NGOs in your country? ps: What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points There were very clear attempts from the U S to interfere in our internal issues Just to give you an example, I was given a two page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S as a foreign minister This two pager contained some measures which the U S government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship but, come on! I mean, it s too much, it s interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary Although our economic and defence military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve ss: We re going to talk about U S Hungary relationship in just a bit Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? ps: What I understand from my colleagues, since I don t supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations ss: What s the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? ps: Since I m not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard ss: I spoke to Ex president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus † and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe Why are they still so supportive of this open door policy? What do you think? ps: I wouldn t speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015 I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there s no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there s war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia So, why the EU carries out this open door policy? You should ask the high ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy It s harming the EU, it s dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU we don t even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not † but if you speak like this, you re going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that migration equals terrorism which you ve never said But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe ss: I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter argument for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested if I m correct a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren t refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it s a homegrown thing ps: It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there s a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are with opening green borders to them, saying please come on in without controlling them does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been double societies or parallel societies constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies We have to speak about this openly We think that this solution based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it s totally against common sense We have to be able to protect ourselves We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that ss: So let s talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey Luxembourg s Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that Aren t you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? ps: No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary we are a Schengen member state, so if there s a decision that a number of ex migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country number one Number two it s against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they re going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx And, number three, it s breaking European regulations These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling ss: Just because this open door policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr Orban, comes out and says bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide I m thinking, maybe, it s a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a national suicide ? ps: There are tricks in that First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don t oblige So, † these are tricks, and it s very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don t want it ss: You ve turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren t the only one there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls Is this the only way, to put up fences? ps: We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there s a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders according to regulation But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you re located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours it even said, during opening hours ! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia so no Schengen member states There s no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations! then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly So, it s tragic, I ll say ss: Are you pro Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? ps: We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it s a suicide for the European economy European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting sequence and adjusting type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone That s what we have been working on, and that s why we don t like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you re accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming ss: You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe s security, especially Germany is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? ps: Very minimum The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it s not true, because we have border crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country † of course, respecting the regulations When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower Only three countries ss: Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really goes against all European but he s still willing to take the risk How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? ps: There s a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately Because of European regulations † you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our † perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal ss: I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington do you think Orban s friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary s relations with the EU? ps: I don t think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he s the President of the U S and I see that there s a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it s not them, it s not liberal Western media, it s not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who s going to be the President of the U S I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him as such a progressive, such a † wonderful, such a smart guy !, but because it s Donald Trump, now he s bashed in every sentence, which I don t think would be fair and correct Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it s American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar † to his position ss: And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti establishment forces, may not win this elections do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? ps: There s a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it s no wonder these are challenging times There s a kind of fight or debate between two camps sovereignists and federalists We say we belong to the sovereignists, of course that European Union can only be strong if the member states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union The only question is how to get there? Our position is that only strong member states can lead to a strong European Union ss: My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy they don t want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe ps: We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn t want to break the European unity but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well ss: Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview Good luck with everything ps: Thank you",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/

"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European forced migration ,"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called Color Revolutions, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps: // tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the Open Society Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civil society, we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civil society I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/

Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers One of his regular claims aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him Although it is a delicious sight watching America s movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold hearted wretchedness of the dual party, borderline fascist system Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks The Establishment would continue unmolested with its too big to jail banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power Trump s ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they d work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril This polarizing issue largely explains Trump s huge popularity among voters today The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump s political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it Amazing comments from the Pope considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank you very much Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff raff According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US Mexican border But the crazy is just beginning Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing Only the government could script such a narrative But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, ùsaid Garza This right here is border insecurity at its best Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities ù If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right wing parties, I really can t imagine it And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political correct speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from No, sending a message to other would be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W Bush s reckless 8 year war on terror Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it He never explained that decision to the public ù A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be All Americans knew is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job ù Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non consequential 8 year intermission by America s first black president) Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree) I think this is a great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, ùshe told C Span early last year I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that ù But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America s former shine @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/

I m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily 1944 opens with the chilling description: When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we re not guilty ù I had to write it It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it, ùsaysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar Armenian family I m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow, went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry Ding a dong, performed by Teach In back in 1975 But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead singer of Teach In Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia There s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done especially if, like me, you are a long standing Eurovision fan who s been watching the event since the 1970s The provocative, politically motivated decision to chose 1944 as their Song for Europe goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons When Johnny Logan performed What s Another Year the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn t singing about the Anglo Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of 1944 ? Believe it or not, it s not just Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars who have had some very bad things done to them in the past The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999 The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars Russia could sing about the 5 7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France s invasion of 1812 The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years And so on Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities and even genocides Few countries in Europe haven t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point and on top of that there s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on and singing about today It s not the first time those with an anti Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: We don t Wanna Put In The artists did not deny their song was a protest against Russian policies The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so Therulesof Eurovision state that No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest ùUkraine s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There s method in Kiev s apparent madness If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she just had to write in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent We ll all be under pressure to give the song Douze Points to show our solidarity with Ukraine If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that free speech is under threat in Europe because we can t hear 1944 I m sure we ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala The West s free speech crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites They didn t say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year s Eurovision not for the lyrics of their song, which was called Wars for nothing but because one of the captions in the song s videocontainedthe words: 2014 Gaza two thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children Israel wasn t mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war But that didn t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary s broadcasting authority, with the result that the offending words in the video were removed While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting Israel who s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests Hungary s Eurovision entry there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting Wars for nothing Already the sort of media outlets you d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and 1944 Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them I would not want to see history repeat itself, Jamalatoldthe US Congress funded station RFE/RL is smart power Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for, saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics! The Ukrainian authorities are going to try to use the song capitalizing on the tragedy of the Tartars to impose on European viewers a false picture of alleged harassment of the Tartars in the Russian Crimea, Crimea s deputy prime minister Russlan Balbek hassaid He s right to be offended The head of Ukraine s National Remembrance Museum has also done his best tostir things up He said that should Jamala win the contest in Stockholm, next year s event would be held in Sevastopol Now there s just one small problem with that Sevastopol is no longer part of Ukraine It s part of Russia The city council of Sevastopol has declared that the only way it could host Eurovision 2017 is if Russia wins this year Does Ukraine really want us to go to war over where the Eurovision Song Contest is held? To debase an international song contest in the way that Ukraine has done is disgraceful By focusing on crimes which occurred in the 1940s, Jamala is also helping to divert international attention away from the economic plight of Ukraine today A country that was once the food basket of eastern Europe is now, thanks to the illegal US/EU sponsored coup of 2014, a veritable basket case It s hard to get one s head round the figures Ukraine s foreign trade has slumped 31 percent in just one year Ukraine s foreign trade collapses 31% in just one year, post EU backed couphttps:// tdotco /xVfNUpkOiH Inflation last February wasestimatedto be running at 64 5 percent a month Ukraine s GDP meanwhile fell for six successive quarters following the democratic revolution of February 2014, while real wages fell by almost 25 percent in the year May 2014 May 2015 The people in Maidan were supposed to protesting against corruption, but Ukraine surprise, surprise, remains themost corruptnation in Europe In fact, looking at how wretched everyday life is for ordinary people in liberated Ukraine today, one can fully understand why Jamala is so keen to take us back to 1944 If she was really brave, she d have penned a song called 2014 that discussed the regime change activities of Victoria Nuland and their consequences She handed us cookies out in the square, and when we next looked at our wage packets, there was nothing there",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333580-ukraines-song-europe-jamala/
"18 Feb, 2016",What matters most: Human rights or the rights of Western governments?,"It seemed unthinkable that after the Iraq tragedy and the ensuing chaos that followed the 2003 US led war there would ever be any support for another attack on an Arab country And yet eight years after the invasion of Iraq, international opinion almost unanimously supported NATO operations in Libya Conveniently labeled no fly zone at inception, the idea was to wage war against Muammar Gaddafi and force him out of office, like Saddam Hussein before him The escalation from simply stopping Libyan planes from flying to bombing raids would not have been acceptable to an ever increasingly skeptical public without the much needed support of the human rights industry This prosperous sector operates the easily marketable commodity that is humanity The idea is that some organizations, based in Western capitals, have a moral imperative to decide what humanity is and how it should be dispensed Their respectability should derive from their fairness, objectivity and commitment to justice That of course is in principle, in reality their objectives are shaped by those who fund them and allow them to operate In the case of Human Rights Watch, one of the most high profile NGOs today, its connection to the US government was so intimate that notable academics and scholars penned a letter in 2014 criticizing its executive director s close links or revolving door policy with the US State Department That relationship is so cozy that while many grassroots activist have denounced the US over police brutality or the disproportionate number of black victims as well as the number of inmates currently held in custody without trial it begs the question of why would a human rights organization which aims to dispense its values to numerous governments across the world appear so blind to the very abuses committed on its own doorstep The answer is that HRW, today viewed as one of the two major human rights organizations alongside Amnesty, only looks at the errors committed by countries whose politics the US disapproves of HRW favors an interventionist agenda and as a result supports almost all wars waged by the US under the cover of humanitarian responsibility, even when the consequences of these military operations would always lead to increased human suffering In the case of the conflict in Syria, HRW s Ken Roth, at the helm of the organization far longer than the average Arab president remains in power, was pushing the now debunked story of Assad forces using chemical weapons against civilians in Ghouta His public statementsthrough social media contradicted even UN reports carried out on the ground in a bid to pursue what he qualifies as a responsibility to protect ù However, that responsibility ùis often carried out through bombing operations The approach in the US is that a Western response is always best and that ultimately only Westerners know best ù Despite boasting divisions for each region of the world (Africa division/Middle East division etc ) the staff manning these sections are almost all exclusively American with only local researchers appointed to junior or mid ranking positions With all the intellectual competence in these various geographies, it should have seemed reasonable to expect senior figures in an organization with an international outlook to have a more international team and yet that is far from the case to this day When even its largest donor, multi billionaire George Soros argues that HRW has to be more effective and be seen as more international, less an American organization, ùsomething is clearly wrong But when Soros donates a staggering$100 millionto an outfit with such proven ties to the US government what does he expect in exchange? In these times of war and climatic instability, feeding the hungry and providing health care to the ill would take priority over offering a huge sum of money to an organization that already operates on a very comfortablebudgetof around $50 million per year George Soros is no ordinary man; he is one of the wealthiest financiers on the planet who has made no secret of where his politics lie Earlier this month, hewrotein the UK s Guardian that Russia sPresident Putinwas one of the greatest threats to Europe While appearing to be critical of both sides on the Ukraine Russia tension, HRW continues to portray Russia as a brutal dictatorship that allows no dissent feeding into the now deeply ingrained perception across much of the West that Russia constitutes a major threat to Europe, another one sided view that is in accordance with US policy and not internationally, where Russia enjoys far greater support outside Europe and North America Another interesting appointment was that of Tom Malinowski in 2001 He was Senior Director on the National Security Council at the White House, before becoming Washington Director for Human Rights Watch Since he left HRW he has returned to a US government position where he nowservesas Assistant Secretary in the Bureau for Democracy in the State Department Because of its close ties to US officials as well as donors with very clear agendas, HRW has seen its credibility suffer a major blow More nuanced organizations such as Amnesty International operate far more effectively due in great part to their astute politics Avoiding all the pitfalls, HRW fell into, AI has in recent years been the respectable face of the now discredited human rights industry and yet its support for avoidable wars has been just as serious if not worse While present in the early days of the Libyan uprisings, AI teams were able to witness the absence of massacres reported across the Western media Keen to sell a necessary war to Western audiences some rebels were courting Western outfitsspeaking of10,000 protesters slaughtered in a matter of days later proven to be false AI hadissuedstatements with headlines pointing almost exclusively to government forces attacks before stating, some paragraphs below, that both sides ùwere committing atrocities The attention grabbing headlines were enough to make the casus belli stronger and analysts and observers, incapable of questioning the motives behind the misleading headlines, would later be unable to challenge such subversive descriptions of the conflict, a conflict that would eventually leave Libya a failed state in the hands of various terrorist groups As with most if not all NGOs, AIfocusesalmost exclusively on violations of human rights committed in third world countries therefore giving the impression that violations are only committed outside the West While its members continuously campaign for African leaders to be handed over to The Hague to face prosecutions for war crimes, it is yet to make any public pronouncement on the former British prime minister s role in the war in Iraq, despite Britain being a signatory to the International Criminal Court of justice It has therefore become a comforting short cut to denounce government politics while turning to human rights organizations representing a moral compass, albeit in accordance with Western opinion While some projects are at times commendable, it appears that these operations close relationships with Western authority points to a sinister agenda that simply sugar coats the horrors of war Human rights should be about ensuring people live in dignity and sheltered from unnecessary violence What the human rights industry has provided is a new narrative: if you die as a result of a Western bomb ùthan you ve been responsibly protected ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332877-human-rights-watch-soros/
"13 Feb, 2016",George Soros: A psychopath s psychopath,"According to Soros, Russia s strategy is to avoid collapse by making the EU implode first by exacerbating the migration crisis and stoking Islamophobia ù On February 11,the Guardianran anarticleby George Soros which had run a day earlierhereentitled Putin is a bigger threat to Europe s existence than Isis ù After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order I have met a few psychopaths in my life a pernicious but small time example is a real estate salesman ù in Spain who cost my family a great deal of time and money The real problem with psychopaths big time and small time is not primarily that they do bad things, but that we non psychopaths are ill prepared to deal with the fundamental difference between us and them We people with operational consciences think (wrongly) that everyone is like us We are shackled to the assumption that just because we would not do unspeakably evil things or would be unable to live with ourselves if we did all other people work the same way They do not When a psychopath lies, or steals, or manipulates or does whatever he thinks is required to get what he wants he has no greater emotional connection with his actions than you or I have with yesterday s lunch We, the non psychopaths, tell little lies and do little wrongs But we have a limit beyond which we will not go For the psychopath, scale makes no difference Stealing a family s savings, or crashing an economy, or destroying a country is of no more consequence to the psychopath than deciding not to return ten bucks to a cashier who had made a mistake And no matter what evil the psychopath meticulously plotted and practiced against you, to him, what happens is your fault Always Which brings me back to George Soros Inthe Guardian sarticle, then, Soros claims the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State ù The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writerGear√≥id √ì Colmain, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what √ì Colmain rightly calls a tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite ù In an interview withRT, √ì Colmain said, There is no War on Terror There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies There is no such thing as ISIS ISIS is a creation of the United States ù Soros and his ilk created and benefit from what Soros calls Islamic State, ù yet his argument not only disregards that fact, it kicks blame in the direction of the one major power Russia which has taken steps to deal with this US creation Soros goes on to make a number of other accusations against Russia, failing at any time to note that Russia alone has a mandate from the legitimate government of Syria, or that Russia is seriously engaged in cleaning house in Syria, a job the US was only simulating Acknowledgement of Russia s successes in Syria comes from many quarters, includingSeymour Hersh Hersh is a high profile American journalist, but one incapable of understanding the reasons for US policy towards Syria, bless him Soros next point is that Putin s aim is to foster the EU s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees ù The truth is that Russia s natural ally is Germany and preventing that alliance is the primary aim of the US government at least according toStratfor, a US intelligence agency Germany s efficiency and organizational abilities combined with Russia s raw materials, inventive genius, and good relations with China, is the combination those funding and directing ISIS least want to see By occupying Germany with an army of aggressive, unskilled, culturally insoluble economic migrants from Africa and elsewhere, the chess players at the board of realpolitik are attempting to head off that natural outcome Soros part in destabilizing Europe is well attested The Daily Mailreported back in November 2015 that Soros was busy telling the EU to take at least a million ù refugees every year In the same article, Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is quoted as saying, This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state ù Orban went on, This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros ù Soros described in the article as a funder of pro migration groups all over the world ù responded to Orban s comments by arguing that his beliefs uphold European values ù I don t know what Soros means by European values, ù but I assume it includes lots more immigration for us unilaterally decided upon by Mr Soros As prime minister of Hungary, Orban is a man with, perhaps, better access than most to the truth about George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary the source for which information is his own father s book Masquerade Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary Thus, Soros has moved effortlessly from collaborating with the Nazis against his fellow Jews an occupation (if you will excuse the pun) he makes little effort to hide totellingindigenous European peoples what the ethnic make up of their countries should be He was also instrumental in the destruction of Ukraine As reported byNew American, Soros has a giant footprint in Ukraine Similar to his operations in dozens of other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens ofmillions of dollarsinto Ukrainian non governmental organizations (NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into a more open and democratic society ù We have good reason to take George Soros seriously Soros article downplays Putin s strategic prowess before going on to anticipate regime change in Russia in 2017 as a result of bankruptcy forced upon it by Western sanctions and crushed oil prices He then appears to credit Putin with masterminding a collapse ù in Europe and of anticipating benefits for Russia in the aftermath He notes, As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy it find yourself asking here: Why then did she create that crisis? ù that is because you are not a psychopath Soros article begins its descent with metaphysical and social observations, which from someone without billions of dollars behind them would be seen as merely subjective musings, before landing squarely on the runway of identifying Putin s Russia as the real threat This is not simplychutzpah The traits Soros exhibits are those of textbook psychopathy: blaming others for his own actions and attacking the victim is what the psychopath does Here, Soros disregards entirely his own extensive role in creating the problem he purports to seek to solve; meanwhile, he accuses Russia, the only country to man up to the war on Syria, of being behind the migration ù Soros has spent millions engineering Soros is part of a cabal which plans the overthrow of countries at dinner Psychopathy is the baseline requirement for membership So if you think conscience will make him and his friends stop at some point before you and your family reach conditions materially identical to those experienced by the inhabitants of the Donbass region or if you think that Western Europe is beyond the scope of their plans for engineered collapse just because you wouldn t do something like that you will find that you are wrong When Europe is in tatters, and its men (whom Soros money helped turn in one lifetime from actual men into effeminized liberal cultural lemmings) are squawking in disbelief as their pampered delusions are shattered in the collapse ù Soros envisages, Soros will not care No matter that this is Europe and it

"24 Jan, 2016",Invasion of Europe: The ship is going down,"It is sobering to realize that the supposed captains on the ship your forebears built over millennia are willfully detonating the bulkheads and drilling large holes in the hull whilst claiming there is nothing anyone could possibly have done The K√ºbler Ross model of trauma describes the emotional pathway for any European with an interest in protecting the continent his forebears created from the perfidy of national leaders whose actions will breed him and his children out of existence First there was denial: surely Angela Merkel couldn t be so stupid as to sink the European ship? Next came anger as news of theorganized attacksby so called asylum seekers on European white women seeped through the checkpointsembeddedin the mainstream media machine Then came the stage known as bargaining as people thought they would settle for somerestrictions on numbersso long as the tidal wave was stopped And now we are at enforced acceptance: the tidal wave will not stop so get used to it with Jeremy Corbyn, for example,callingfor the UK to take similar numbers as Germany If you feel like you didn t vote for any of this, that s because you didn t Your opinion isn t worth the paper it s written on It s people likeGeorge Soroswho are making these decisions Your job is to shut up, pay taxes, and learn toget on boardwith this new round of social engineering and ethnic cleansing But now that it is obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that hand wringing apart the fix is in, it is interesting to observe how career politicians are talking now that the dust is settling on the new reality Because talk is all that they will do We are at the tipping point And once we get over that, the ship is going down, make no mistake The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, for example, has managed albeit belatedly to get an intellectual handle on what s going on: the refugee crisis isdestabilizingEurope Now, he does not mean what you and I mean by Europe: our countries, nations, languages and histories He s aBilderbergerso he has at least a mid level understanding of the actual plan and doesn t care about any of the things the people who vote for him care about He means the Union of European Soviet Socialist Republics; the Brussels oligarchy in other words The Guardianwrites: He said a message to refugees that said Come, you will be welcome ù provoked major shifts in population His grasp of the obvious now it is too late to do anything about it is impressive The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Europe was close to breaking point: We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks ùBut, he went on: No one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair weather system then it cannot survive ù Geert Wilders is described by the liberal press as a far right Dutch politician This means he has stayed roughly where our grandparents were while everyone else was processed by Cultural Marxism Wilders has called for the invading, marauding males to be locked up in asylum centers and for the safety of Dutch women and girls to be put first What a novel idea This isn t far right It is just right But, we already know, it will never happen RTinterviewedHansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party Mueller said: Germany now is somewhere at the edge of anarchy and sliding towards civil war, or to become a banana republic without any government He went on: Bavaria is the first region because we are affected the most we are living on the border to Austria where the influx of refugees stems from But the second regions of Germany where this happens are Saxony and Thuringia First of all, they have also borders to the Czech Republic, that s the first reason And the second reason is that in former Eastern Germany people are still aware of what it is living in a dictatorship They are feeling quite well that our so called democracy is sliding more and more towards a totalitarian state Interesting and objectively correct words But then Mueller does not hold any real power Donald Tusk, on the other hand as chief apparatchik in the European Soviet machine does have power He nowwarnsthat we have only two months to get things under control This means, of course, when after two months the invasion is only worse, we will be expected to accept the situation asfait accompli Tusk also has a holy reverence for the nonsense known as the Schengen Agreement and warned that if Europe fails to make the strategy work we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen, ùthe 26 nation passport free travel zone How complicated is it? There is nothing holy about the Schengen Agreement the UK is not party to it, for example But European leaders talk about it as though it weresomehow problematicto revoke it It s not The Schengen is an idea The invasion of Europe and the destruction of the ancient cultures within it, however, is very real If these were not refugees but infantrymen (even ones without guns) arriving from let s say North Korea, this problem would not have got to first base This is an invasion But because it is dressed up in the garb Europeans fall for every time the language of compassion we are now in a state where European womencannot walk unmolestedin their own streets oruse public poolswithout being subjected to degradation Given the political will, this problem can be fixed in a five minute conversation It s a group Skype call at best The fact that this doesn t happen belies the reality: the fix is in, and politicians like Valls and apparatchiks like Tusk are trying to distance themselves from the inevitable fallout This is why they are saying things they think people will want to hear: not because they are going to step up and do what is necessary, but because they don t want the coming chaos attached to their names The solution is obvious: stop saving all the ships arriving in Europe; put officers with real powers on borders, and have anyone without a passport or other valid ID immediately ejected from the EU space And border guards both at the peripheries of individual countries and the EU itself should be told in clear and uncertain terms what their job is: to protect what s behind them from what s in front of them If EU border guards pay was inversely indexed to the number of persons shown to have entered the EU illegally and if internal police had equivalent motivations this problem would be solved in a month If there is a genuine case for asylum based on the existing legal framework the place for that discussion is on the border of the EU, not within it Germany has followed Switzerland inconfiscating the assetsof refugees over a certain value shown to befour figure sumson average This will do nothing other than ensure that the next wave comes with nothing, or has it sent over in parcels later The real causes for invasion lie with neo colonialism and the banking cartel which drives it philanthropists such as Soros and NATO s genocide against Libya and the murder of Gaddafi who was holding back the population floodgates for us NATO has no compunction about killing people in very large numbers when it suits the bankers agenda The fact that Europe s military is pussy footing around now that we actually need soldiers to do their only legitimate job defend our borders suddenly everyone is Albert Schweitzer The case is so plain, even 16 year old German girls with no previous interest in politics are getting it Anyone who suggests taking effective action is labelled far right by the liberal media which panders to those whose intellects are bypassed by means of emotional trigger words such as compassion But the motif of the ship is a fair one When a ship goes down there are never enough lifeboats Sailors are trained to beat off with violence those still in the sea once the lifeboat is full If they do not everyone dies This is real compassion If there is a silver lining in this tale of corruption and perfidy it is this: the liberal s catch all justification for his crimes against his own people that of pleading compassion is no longer beyond criticism People have had enough Wanting your family and your culture to survive does not make you evil This is not a game; it is deadly serious And if the helm cannot be wrest from those bent on taking the ship down, it s time for those with the wit and the means to make a quiet move for the exits",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/329961-invasion-europe-migrants-brussels/
"20 Dec, 2015",Is the EU the new USSR?,"As in the Soviet Union, in the European Union the nation state is subordinate to the Union If the USSR was an evil empire then what is the EU? Cameron was in Brussels for the recent summit For better of worse, this is the man the British people believe directs their government And he was in Brussels toask the EUif he could do some governing The answer in short was no To hear those the mainstream media refers to as our leaders talk about the EU one would think that leaving it implied national suicide Cameron himself ishyperbolicon the question of the need for Britain s inclusion The numbers do not agree The Daily Mail ran apiecerecently on Norway which it described as: prosperous, happy and free Its countryside is neat and well husbanded, its towns and cities orderly and comfortable Its people shame much of Europe by their command of foreign languages, and it runs its own affairs, trading cheerfully with the EU In the 30 years from 1971 to 2001, its gross domestic product rose by 177 per cent Denmark, which has been in the EU for much of that period, increased its GDP by 75 per cent and the UK, which has been in the EU almost the whole period, saw an increase of 98 per cent This suggests, at least, that non membership has not held Norway back ù Switzerland, likewise, is safe, stable and rich And, like Norway, it isnot an EU member The fact is that countries can do very nicely outside the EU What is less clear is how well they can do within it The EU is a lesson in deceit Like joining a cult or a pyramid scheme, the true nature and cost of the abusive system one is entering are hidden until after the ink has dried on the contract; and having joined, one will not be privy to the agenda guiding what one is now paying to support The New York Times puts theunderhand natureof the incremental creation of a European bloc into perspective, almost in passing Looking at Cameron s recent Brussels visit, the paper notes: The departure of Britain from the bloc would throw into reverse for the first time the so called European project, a program of integration that began with six countries with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and that has since expanded to 28 nations, with several others eager to join ù That s right, this entity which tells the Prime Minister of Britain what he can and cannot do began life as a coal and steel agreement In hindsight, it is clear that this 1951 treaty was simply a purchase point needed leverage in what was to follow The agreement itself expired and was abandoned in 2002 and one is left wondering at what undeclared future milestones existing agreements are, in fact, directed The man who in 1973 took the UK into what was then called the European Economic Community or Common Market was Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath In October 2011, Conservative Member of Parliament, Mark Reckless, said during a debate on an EU referendum that Ted Heath had promised the British public that they would have the veto over any important issues ù He continued: Yet those same people are now told that what they were then told was a common market, has become a political union in which we can be outvoted whether we like it or not ù This, then, was a clear case of bait and switch Since his death in 2005, Heath has been implicated in child molestation cases The Guardian reports: An alleged victim, a woman, was interviewed by Clive Driscoll[ ] He retired last year having reached the rank of detective chief inspector Driscolltold the Guardianthe woman he interviewed said she had been abused as a child by a group of people, including Heath on multiple occasions: The person was 100% sure they were talking about Ted Heath She totally believed what she was saying and that s where the investigation starts, not where it stops ù The woman claimed the abuse happened at a time after Heath had served as prime minister Driscoll said others made similar abuse allegations, but he was not asked to take statements from them ù Whether the Establishment willclose rankson this case as it has on that pertaining to EU Commissioner Leon Brittan remains to be seen If the allegations against Heath are true, it is unlikely that such an abhorrent feature of his sexual character surfaced only when he was out of office And that being the case, he would have been entirely controlled by whatever person or agency had the dirt on him while he was Prime Minister My point is this: the history of the development of the EU project bears witness to a clear and pre existing agenda one which has remained hidden from the view of both the public and non senior Members of Parliament And as regards the UK, susceptibility to blackmail by outside forces in the case of the primary actor in the legislative process which resulted in membership must be considered a genuine possibility In the light of the above, the underlying policy behind the EU project increasingly looks like a pre agreed business plan whose KPIs relate solely to implementing that plan while masking the fact of its existence and ensuring compliance at any price In such a case, the rules of realpolitik require that the implementation of policy be seen as responses to external circumstances or to the will of the population Thus, mass non European immigration and the transformation of discrete, largely homogenous white countries into a culturally lost, self loathing wasteland look less like a blunder of some kind and more like an expression of original intent George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis the source for which information is his own father s bookMasquerade îDancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary has aplanready for the next stage for Europe This plan begins with accepting 1 million refugees Sputnik News regards thecurrent influxas a social engineering project ùand event engineered at least in part by Soros himself But there is no reason why the EU or the US for that matter should be inherently spastic when it comes to the business of protecting their own boarders;

Can modern states protect their borders or not? I don t mind, so long as we are consistent Is it so unreasonable for the US and the EU to aspire to the type of border controls Israel enjoys? For the record, while I can get behind a true constitutional republic such as America once had, I haveno time for democracywhich I regard as a mechanism designed to simulate choice while facilitating compliance So I am not here to wax lyrical about democracy on my own account What interests me more is the cognitive dissonance those who do believe they have a choice must experience when they see that on any subject which matters the man they are told represents them in this case Cameron is flicked away by EU grandees like so much fluff when he wishes to be seen to try to take an actual decision when the very history of the EU itself implies the pursuit of a covert, non democratic agenda Perhaps an answer is to be found in the words of Aldous Huxley in Brave New World: A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude ù Writer, lecturer and political dissident from the former USSR, Vladimir Bukovsky, delivers a blistering comparison of the European Union with the Soviet Union His catalogue of comparisons includes the fact that: The Soviet Union was governed by 15 unelected people, who appointed each other and who were not accountable to anyone The European Union is governed by two dozen people, who appoint each other and are not accountable to anyone ù His disturbing and lucid monologue concludes with the words: I have lived in your future, and it didn t work ù",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/326577-eu-ussr-brussels-london/

 the Minister of Transportation in Iraq had been a Sunni Arab then
 the following would ve happened: ISIS would ve realized their dreams of a global caliphate were
 misguided and would ve disbanded Anjem Choudary, the notorious UK hate preacher, would have

 financial and historical roots in Saudi Arabia and the wider
 Arabian Peninsula In the case of the terrorist groups massacring
 Muslims, Christians and anyone else in their way, a particular
 reading of this philosophy is Salafi Jihadism, which sees as its
 end goal the establishment of the aforementioned global
 caliphate Still the marginalization canard persists to justify
 the barbarous rampage of ISIS which includes indiscriminate
 massacres against Shia Muslims, who they regard as heretics It
 is interesting to note that in any other country, such
 equivocation would be shut down in a heartbeat as justifying
 terrorism You can t point to the massive inequality targeting
 French, mainly North African Muslims to try to explain Charlie
 Hebdo, but you can say the Shia deserve to beslaughtered like sheepat Camp Speicher because, you
 know, jobs and stuff There are, of course, several agendas behind this The first is a
 quite shameless attempt by some who supported the invasion and
 occupation of Iraq towash their hands of any responsibilityfor
 it What better way than to blame the locals for the electoral
 system you imposed which has hamstrung repeated Iraqi
 administrations over the past decade, with the over emphasis on
 sect and ethnicity, and the power sharing structure which leads
 to inherently weak and corrupt governments The Shia Arabs form 60 percent of the Iraqi population but have
 shared power with all of Iraq s other minority groups in order to
 keep the peace These groups have played the role of spoilers in
 order to achieve their own respective interests The mainly Sunni
 Kurds have consistently threatened to secede should Baghdad stop
 paying the Kurdish Region its $1 billion welfare check, while the
 Sunni Arabs have drifted between boycotts of the political
 process and terrorism in order to pressure the central government
 for more concessions But as far as US leaders are concerned,
 when the US withdrew from its brutal occupation the message to
 the Iraqis was it s your baby now, you deal with it ù As Shireen T Hunter, a Professor at Georgetown University, states
 in her seminal piece; the exclusion of Iraq s Sunnis from
 leadership posts in Baghdad has been blown out of proportion 
 Western and especially US dislike of Iran has been a major cause
 for the disregarding of mass killings and assassination of
 Shias ù This brings us to the next agenda The Iraqi government has built
 close ties to its Persian neighbor to the east The Islamic
 Republic has supported successive Iraqi administrations, invested
 billions of dollars into the Iraqi economy, helped develop the
 holy shrine cities of Najaf, Karbala and Samarra and,
 particularly since last June,helped Iraqin its war with the so called
 Islamic State In fact numerous Iraqi officials have stated
 thatif it wasn t for Iran, and not the US, ISIS
 would ve been fighting in Baghdad itself and not currently on the
 defensive against the Alliance of Iraqi armed forces, Shia
 militias and local anti ISIS Sunni tribes This alliance which forms part of the broaderresistance axishas presented a huge problem
 for the regional foes of Iran and by extension, their Shia
 allies, both in Iraq and the wider region The first and foremost
 foe is the Israeli regime The Israeli obsession with Iran has
 led to an alliance with the Syrian rebels and in particular theal Qaeda branch in Syria, Jabhat Al Nusra, to
 which even theUN has borne witness Israeli Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the US congress at the invite of the
 Republican Party earlier this month and used his speech to
 excoriate a proposed US Iran deal over Iran s peaceful civilian
 nuclear program His message was that Iran is the major threat to
 world peace and not ISIS He is joined in this assessment by the Sunni monarchies just
 across the Gulf from Iran The Saudi s are also terrified, and
 claim to be under siege as the Islamic Republic, which now wields
 serious influence in Syria to the north, Yemen to the south and
 Iraq to the East Of course, the Saudi sponsorship of radical
 Sunni groups both within Iran s borders and without doesn t seem
 to be a problem or considered meddling bybiased and increasingly sectarianWestern
 policy makers & analysts Saudi money has gone a long way
 towards building this alternative reality, in coordination with
 theirallies in Tel Aviv Human Rights Watch, who
 havesolicited fundsfrom within Saudi Arabia and
 arefundedby billionaire regime changer George
 Soros, have also disproportionately focused their indignation
 against the Shia volunteer groups and Sunni tribes uniting to
 fight ISIS, while their chief Ken Roth extolled the virtues of

 11, 2014 As the volunteers and their allies havemade gainswith Iranian assistance against
 ISIS in Tikrit, the criticism has reached a crescendo with people
 having the audacity to draw equivalence between ISIS on one side
 and those fighting for their very survival on the other While
 Christians and Yezidis are given a chance to repent ù or pay the
 Jizya protection tax to ISIS, Shias are afforded no such luxury 
 They are killed on sight, offered no chance of redemption, while
 ISIS hasvowed to attackthem in their holy cities in
 the heartlands of the South This narrative of victim blaming draws on the most putrid
 sectarian & racist biases and plays into the hands of ISIS
 and its supporters It helps them to justify their unjustifiable
 acts But more importantly, it falls into the context of an
 attempt by two of the world s most horrific regimes in Israel and
 Saudi Arabia to spread an irrational fear of Iranian influence in
 the region It is a narrative that seeks to derail the nuclear
 talks as well, with all the devastating consequences that could
 entail",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/244253-shia-isis-iraq-sunni-power/
"31 Oct, 2014", Moscow ends up at risk with Ukraine gas agreement ,"It is not clear what Moscow gets out of a deal with Ukraine by selling gas below market price, and guaranteeing supplies to Europe while there are still sanctions and anti Russian propaganda, Paul Roberts, former Assistant US Treasury Secretary, told RT RT:How important is thisdealfor Ukraine and Europe? Paul Roberts: It is not clear what the Russian government gets
 out of it They have agreed to sell gas to Ukraine at a
 subsidized price, far below the market price And yet Ukraine
 continues to carry on propaganda against Russia, continues to
 attack the Russian population in eastern and southern Ukraine Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU Russia Ukraine gas agreement: I don t think [the IMF] had
 any choice They didn t want to get down this road But the
 alternative would have been absolutely awful: it would have
 been large parts of Europe without gas come the middle of
 winter, and that would have been utter and complete disaster RT:But getting away from those attacks how
 significant is this deal for Europe and for Ukraine, did they
 walk away winners in this? PR:Of course Europe and Ukraine walks away and
 Russia is a loser Here you have Russia subsidizing the countries
 that are imposing sanctions on it, trying to destroy Russia RT:Some experts say that Russia is a winner
 in this situation? Do you agree with that? Is this a good price
 for gas? PR:Why is a hundred dollars below the market
 price a good price? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
 Russia will ever be paid If they are not going to be paid, what
 are they going to do? They are going to cut off the gas in the
 middle of the winter so that Washington propaganda can say: Look at these evil Russians, they are starving, freezing
 Ukrainians, the gas is cut off! ùI don t think Russians
 understand what they are dealing with Washington is far more
 devious and sophisticated then Russia can comprehend This is not
 that Russia has a chance Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU Russia Ukraine gas agreement: Ukraine is broken largely
 because the EU broke it through the policies it has followed
 over the last year, and now Europe has to pay for that I don t
 think financially they are very happy about it, but
 realistically, what choice did they have ù RT:But it is not Ukraine that is going to
 pay this money to Russia The EU and IMF have said they re ready
 to finance Kiev s debt to Russia But the Ukrainian economy is in
 tatters Can they expect to get the money back? PR:If the IMF pays the Ukrainian bills it takes
 it back out of Ukraine This is not a gift to Ukraine If the
 Ukrainian economy blows up which is likely to be the case the
 IMF sees it is not going to be paid because Ukraine can t pay 
 Russians won t be paying RT:Russia is having economic problems of
 its own Is this agreement a positive step for Moscow too? PR:I think Moscow ends up at risk with this
 agreement Washington is very interested in doing all the damage
 it possibly can to Russia because Russia is a potential check on
 Washington s hegemony over the world So for all the prices
 falling is good as far as Washington is concerned I think it is
 foolish for the Russians to let their currency be traded at
 foreign exchange markets because Washington can attack the ruble
 and the exchange markets and drive it down Just as George Soros
 did One person was able to destroy the British pound Washington
 can easily destroy the ruble I still don t think Russians
 understand what they are up against; they are not really in the
 game Vladimir Putin is a good leader and he gives good speeches,
 but he doesn t seem to be able to prevent the continuing assaults
 on Russia Despite giving Ukraine a subsidized gas price, despite
 Russia guaranteeing energy supplies to Europe in the winter,
 there is no reduction in sanctions, there is no stop in the
 propaganda against Russia In fact the propaganda has increased
 because Washington is afraid that Russia might gain some
 advantage from treating Ukraine in such a kind way What is
 Russia gaining out of this? It is not getting anything Here is
 Russia with a power to turn energy off in Europe It doesn t use
 it, it doesn t say to these countries in Europe: Look, if

"12 Aug, 2014", Sovereign debt for territory: A new global elite swap strategy,"In recent decades, dozens of sovereign nations have fallen into ever deepening trouble by becoming indebted with the private megabank over world ù for amounts far, far in excess of what they can ever pay back Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Is this due to bankers professional malpractice coupled with
 government mismanagement on a truly grand scale? Or are we seeing
 global power elite long term planners slowly achieving their
 goals? Recurrent sovereign debt crises reflect neither over lending
 mistakes ùby bankers and investors, nor innocence ùon the part of successive governments in deeply indebted nations Rather, it all ties in with a global model for domination driven
 by a system of perpetual national debt which Ihave called The Shylock Model ù As with the tango which requires rhythm and bravado, Argentina is
 again dancing centre stage to global mega bankers financial
 tunes after falling into a new technical default ù Not
 just because the country is unable to pay off its massive public
 debt by heeding the rules of the game ùas written and
 continuously re vamped by global usurers, but now with added
 legal immorality and judicial indecency on the part of New York s
 Second District Manhattan Court presided by Judge Daniel Griesa Griesa has shown no qualms in putting US law at the service of
 immoral parasitic bankers and investors ùsuch as Paul
 Singer of the Elliott/NML Fund and Mark Brodsky of the Aurelius
 Fund The mainstream media inside and outside Argentina refer to these
 parasitic money sloshers ùas vulture funds ù;
 a conceptual mistake because one might then be led to believe
 that other funds and bankers Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citigroup,
 JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, George Soros, Rothschild, Warburg
 are not vultures ùwhen, in fact, the very foundations
 of today s global banking system lie on parasitic pro vulture
 rules and laws coupled with an overpowering lack of moral values Sovereign debts are a major problem in just about every country
 in the world, including the US, UK and EU nations So much so,
 those debts have become a Damocles Swords threatening the
 livelihood of untold billions of workers around the world One often wonders why governments indebt themselves for so much
 more than they can ever hope to pay Here, Western economists,
 bankers, traders, Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel
 laureates and the mainstream media have a quick and monolithic
 reply: because all nations need investment and
 investors ùif they wish to build highways, power plants,
 schools, airports, hospitals, raise armies, service
 infrastructures and a long list of et ceteras, economic and
 national activities are all about But more and more people are starting to ask a fundamental
 common sense question: why should governments indebt themselves
 in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
 mega bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
 and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their
 own local sovereign currency instead? Here is where all the above experts ùgo berserk &
 ballistic, shouting back: Issue currency? Are you crazy??
 That s against the rules & laws ù of economics!!! Issuing
 national sovereign currency to finance the real economy s
 monetary needs leads to inflation and lost jobs and chaos and 
 (puts us nice mega bankers out of a job )!! ùThat s when
 they all gang up into noisy The sky is falling! The sky is
 falling!! ùmode Then you ask them: What happens when countries default on their
 unpayable sovereign debts as they invariably and repeatedly do
 not just in Argentina, but in Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, France,
 Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Portugal, Russia, Bolivia,
 Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and
 Indonesia? Again the voice of the experts ù: Then countries
 must restructure ù their debts kicking them forwards 20, 40 or
 more years into the future, so that your great, great, great
 grandchildren can continue paying them ù Oh, I see! The truth is that countries need public spending to maintain
 their economies resilient and buoyant, their citizens working,
 prospering and happy; their nation states sovereign, strong and
 secure OK: happy, secure and working populations cannot be defined as a
 formula that can be readily integrated into expert ùeconomists spreadsheets However, there s a basic truth that
 should be obvious by now: Finance (which is the virtual world of
 bankers, investments, speculation and usury) should always be
 fully subordinated to the Real Economy (which is the world of
 work, production, buildings, milk & bread and services) All this begs the obvious question: Since governments have a
 natural tendency to overspend and end up getting themselves into
 too much debt, which is the better option then: that their red numbers ù(aka sovereign debt) should
 be owed to themselves; their own nation states (debt in local
 currency that in the last instance can be written off, even if a
 bad bout of inflation cannot be stopped, countries can always
 revamp their currencies as Argentina repeatedly did over the past
 forty years), whereby the whole debt crisis ùbasically
 becomes a short term internal affair (albeit painful!), or to convert those red numbers ùinto foreign currency
 debt (US Dollars or Euro) fully controlled by powerful far away,
 well organized creditor technocrats and global mega bankers
 sitting at the FED and IMF in Washington DC; the European Central
 Bank in Frankfurt; or perched in eager expectation in their Wall
 Street vulture nests? This tongue twister, which famously proved too much for Baby Bush
 to muster, is a fitting description of how the hellish sovereign
 debt system really works in the long term Argentina s recurrent defaults and debt restructuring go back
 many decades For brevity s sake, let s just point to 1956 right
 after President Juan Domingo Per√≥n was ousted by a very bloody
 1955 US UK (and mega banker) sponsored military coup Per√≥n was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina
 with the mega bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all
 of Argentina s sovereign debt So, once the mega bankers got rid
 of him in 1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created
 the Paris Club ùto engineer decades worth of sovereign
 debt for vanquished Argentina, something they ve been doing until
 today But each sovereign debt crisis cycle became shorter, more
 virulent and more toxic By December 2001, Argentina had collapsed financially sinking
 into the largest sovereign debt default in history Immediately,
 the IMF s deputy manager Anne Krueger proposed some new and
 creative ideas ùon what to do about Argentina She published them in 2002 in an article on the IMF s website: Should Countries like Argentina be able to declare
 themselves bankrupt? ù, in which she said that the
 lesson is clear: we need better incentives to bring debtors and
 creditors together before manageable problems turn into
 full blown crises ù, adding that the IMF believes this
 could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy regimes like
 Chapter 11 in the US ù She pointed this out as a possible new approach ù,
 adding that of course many practical and political obstacles
 to getting such an approach up and running ùneeded to be
 overcome, the key features would need the force of law
 throughout the world ù, creating a predictable (global)
 legal framework ù From the stance of global mega bankers geopolitical long term
 planners, Ms Krueger s proposal consisted of first gradually
 driving countries into receivership, and then sequentially into
 full fledged bankruptcy Then as if nations were private corporations like Enron or
 WorldCom they could be broken up into as many digestible ùpieces as possible, to be gobbled up by
 international creditors in some global vulture fest banquet These ideas were developed in greater detail in her IMF essay, A New Approach to Debt Restructuring ù, and in a Foreign Affairs ù(mouthpiece of the powerful New
 York Based Elite think tank, Council on Foreign Relations)
 article published in July/August 2002 by Harvard professor
 Richard N Cooper: Chapter 11 for Countries ù Here, Cooper very matter of factly recommends that only if
 the debtor nation cannot restore its financial health are its
 assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed to its creditors 
 again under the guidance of a (global) court ù(!) During those turbulent years, the global press Time and The New
 York Times, for example even suggested that the immensely rich
 Patagonia southern region should secede from Argentina as a
 defaulted debt payment mechanism In June 2005, however, a new sovereign debt bond mega swap was
 instrumented by Argentina s new president, Nestor Kirchner, and
 his Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna However, as Argentina became more and more structurally mired in
 debt, its sovereign debt crisis cycle grew shorter and shorter so
 that by 2010 a new debt crisis was in the books involving yet
 more debt reengineering, this time by President Cristina Kirchner
 and her Economy Minister (and today prosecuted Vice President)
 Amado Boudou But that too failed to hold for long, and today Singer s
 NML/Elliot Fund and Brodsky s Aurelius Fund have pushed Argentina
 again into default, this time with the legal backing of local
 Manhattan Federal Judge Griesa and the US Supreme Court The very fact that today the fate of Argentina s sovereign debt
 lies with the US Judiciary is an eloquent sign of things to come Surprisingly, Ms Krueger recently came out in defense ùof Argentina recommending Judge Griesa and his Vulture
 Nest ùboys should not act hastily killing off the Argentine
 hen that lays golden eggs In an article published July 2014, she warns that the US
 Supreme Court s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle, and may
 very well further increase the risk attached to holding sovereign
 debt and this, to the cost of issuing it ù The specialized and mainstream media Financial Times, New York
 Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist are also recommending
 Judge Griesa and his vulture chicks to show more restraint
 because in today s delicate post 2008 banking system, a new and
 less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart the global
 elite s plans for an orderly transition towards a new global
 legal architecture ùthat will allow orderly liquidation of
 financially failed states like Argentina Especially if such debt
 were to be collateralized by its national territory (what else is
 left!?) Will yet another sovereign debt bond mega swap be imposed upon
 Argentina, this time with large swathes of its national territory
 especially Patagonia being used as collateral guarantee? That would mean that in a few years time the Shylocks in Wall
 Street and London will do everything they can to yet again push
 Argentina into default, since that would pave the way for them to legally ùtake over its territory cashing in on their
 collateral as compensation ù Remember: usurer Shylock drooled at the mouth whilst sharpening
 his knife preparing to cut deep into Merchant Antonio s heart He
 didn t give a damn about the 3000 ducats owed him: he just wanted
 the pound of flesh legally ùhis Is this what the coming Sovereign Debt Model ùwill look
 like? If we tie this all in with what the unfolding of Act
 III ùin the on goingIsrael Palestine crisiswhereby re settling
 millions of Israeli civilians into southern Argentina might be on
 the drawing board, we can then begin to understand how nicely
 Argentina s next debt crisis will tie in: The global
 Rothschild s, Warburg s, Lazard s, Soros, Rockefellers will be
 able to legally ùtake over Patagonia, and then legally ùhand it over to whomever they wish without a
 single shot being fired! If this is what s really happening behind the curtains regarding
 Argentina, does anybody believe it will stop there? Beware Greece, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Korea,
 Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa the world government is
 marching in!",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/179772-sovereign-debt-for-territory/
"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to voluntarily commit suicide ,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT s Truthseeker RT:Could you
 summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
 IMF loans, to Ukraine s best assets ending up in private Western
 hands the IMF s knee breaker role as you memorably described
 it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
 mind is that finance today is war by non military means The aim
 of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
 ending up with its property The main property to obtain is that
 which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange For
 Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
 companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
 oligarchs For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
 these assets and their revenue into foreign hands in an economy
 whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
 of the failed post 1991 restructuring That is where the IMF
 comes in The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
 deficits Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
 mainly to maintain a country s exchange rate The effect usually
 is to subsidize flight capital out of the country at a high
 exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
 dollars or euro In Ukraine s case, foreign creditors would
 include Gazprom, which already has been paid something The IMF
 transfers a credit to its Ukraine account, ùwhich then
 pays foreign creditors The money never really gets to Ukraine or
 to other IMF borrowers It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
 including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
 Greece Such loans come with conditionalities ùthat
 impose austerity This in turn drives the economy even further
 into debt forcing the government to tighten the budget even
 more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
 assets RT:Can Ukraine expect the so called IMF
 effect of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
 to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
 to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants 
 remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP (About $10 billion a
 year ) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
 Western Europe The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
 more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work They will send
 some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
 Ukrainian currency vis √† vis the ruble and euro RT:How are the IMF s tools in reality
 weapons of mass destruction ù as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
 austerity and unemployment The result is a downward economic
 spiral Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues So governments are
 told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets 
 mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
 extract economic rent The effect is to turn the economy into a
 renting tollbooth economy ùHitherto free public roads
 are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
 sewer systems also are privatized This raises the cost of
 living, and hence the cost of labor while overall wage levels
 are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
 raises unemployment RT:The IMF s perhaps also a weapon of mass
 destruction in a more literal sense The organization has
 publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
 re design its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
 Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting 
 Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
 instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF s conditionality ùis that
 it pacify ùthe East Pacification may occur violently
 in today s Orwellian rhetoric The only way in which actual
 political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
 federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
 kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
 the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
 prosecuted the IMF All that voters can do is reject governments
 submitting to IMF conditionalities Many voters who are able will vote with their feet ùand simply leave the sinking
 economy So the IMF s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
 are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered 
 Austerity is ultimately a policy nobody is holding gun to their
 head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
 in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it In this
 sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago RT:Everyone knows austerity s effects on
 Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don t want it;
 even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn t work Why will
 Ukraine s leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
 job in the West when they ve voted out or something? MH:Ukraine s leaders are mainly kleptocrats 
 Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
 their own power George Soros has written that their best way to
 do this is to find Western partners This will provide US and
 European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
 economy Western support will provide more IMF and European
 lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
 can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
 banks RT:Do you think that the EU isn t stupid
 enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one sided
 association agreement, member states will just strip the country
 of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
 Ukraine s 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
 member One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
 German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Ukraine has rich Western land,
 and that part of the country is largely still rural Foreign
 investors would like to buy it out and re feudalize ùit, creating large business farms But the EU is unlikely to
 provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
 investment in Western European agriculture The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
 benefit from its inexpensive labor Wrecking the economy
 Greek style or Irish style or Latvian style is sufficient to send
 its workers to the West And the most mobile traditionally are
 the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
 languages and with skills in demand in the West RT:You noted Ukraine must have asked the
 US first before blowing up that gas pipeline Do you think NATO
 will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
 less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
 waging a big PR campaign in Europe MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
 economy much more high cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
 in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange The NATO
 rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
 Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine won t continue
 subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
 Russia can arm itself against us [with this money] ù The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
 manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
 defend itself And without purchasing foreign technology and
 without large state subsidy as US and European governments
 provide their own economies Russia cannot create a
 manufacturing economy So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
 earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
 that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
 military power my potentially be used to achieve political
 independence from the US sphere RT:Anything else you would like to
 add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
 throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
 power of elected governments, and hence of democracy Governments
 are sovereign No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
 or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
 state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
 war At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
 financial oligarchy, or elected governments The two sets of aims
 are antithetical: rising living standards and national
 independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international

I mean, Russia is a reliable supplier; it has never halted the flow of gas to Europe It only had to reroute the gas when Ukraine would stop the transit afq: Look, this goes beyond whether countries are causing or not problems The structure of long term, safe, reliable trade between countries requires a commitment of many players In the energy dialogue we have learned that security of demand is as important as security of supply And what we re seeing now in the context of Russian European trade and Ukraine as a transit country is a responsible behavior from all sides There s conversation going on, which is the right approach when there is a divergence of views, and we welcome this very much Of course issue is not simple, but to the extent that the interested parties are participating in this dialog, it should be welcomed by everyone ss: :OK, but now we have a special situation on our hands There is a civil war going on in Ukraine Russia is Europe s biggest gas supplier Now half of the gas flow to Europe is passing through Ukraine Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? afq: Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? ss: Yeah, because, you know, it s an unusual situation right now in Ukraine It s beyond just being a safe supplier or safe transit route, there is a civil war going on in the country afq: Again, the fundamental component of any country s energy policy involves diversification Suppliers and demanders, producers and consumers always have to have diversification as one of the objectives of energy policy if they want to enhance the energy security The fact that European countries have pursued a policy of diversification, the fact that Russia itself is pursuing a policy of diversification, both of energy sources and of markets: it s just a sensible policy regardless of the circumstances ss: But if we talk in terms of today, not in one year or two or three years, but, like, today the way things are looking right now, remembering 2006 and 2009 Ukraine was late with its gas payments and intercepted Europe bound Russian gas Could that happen again right now? afq: The first thing to keep in mind is that we re in a different world right now from 2009 Europe has made investments in diversification, Russia has also approached this with a mindset of diversification, investments that it has done to go with Europe now are looking towards markets in the East, and there is also a stronger political infrastructure, to call it somehow, to address this issue, so we re not exactly facing the same situation And investments in diversification involved not only the inter connectedness in Europe, but new markets Europe is set to increase its energy imports, as we have also seen Russia, as I have said, is looking for markets elsewhere and this should strengthen the energy security for all interested parties ss: OK, but talking of diversification, you would think that the South Stream pipeline project would have taken care of many things it would be so beneficial to Europe; but then you see Bulgaria all of a sudden halting its construction What do you think happened there? What went wrong? afq: As usual in this cases, it is never simple to bring all the various interests to coincide That s why investments in gas are long term usually they take a sometimes protracted negotiation process, and what we re seeing is precisely that It s not necessarily easy to bring this many countries and companies to agree on what is a best approach to these very sizeable investments ss: Look, I m not insinuating anything afq: Now, that said, it is of course important that there s a responsible behavior from all sides, producers consumers and transit countries, and, well, the fact that there are complications, does not imply that there is an irresponsible behavior per se There are just various points of view that have to be made compatible in the process of these negotiations ss: And every country has the right to decide on its own whether they want to be part of a pipeline project, or not But if Russian gas was no longer available, what alternatives are there? For example, Norway s Statoil announced it could increase gas supplies to the European Union, but it just wouldn t be enough in terms of quantity to make up for all of the Russian gas So, what are the alternatives as of today? afq: First of all, I would not start from that premise I don t think that the Russian gas will not be available Second, let s keep in mind that gas consumption as such of total energy consumption in Europe is 5 percent This means that Europe is diversified and has options, and together with new measures that are being taken in Europe, approaches to diversify like I have said their energy needs and their sources of gas supply, I don t see a scenario of any major disruption and I do see that Europe has many options on the table to deal with any situation Europe has a diversified energy system, even taking into account that Russia is such an important gas supplier to Europe ss: And can the US make up any shortfall in energy supplies for Europe? afq: Well, that s a question that everyone is asking, what s going to be the impact of the unconventionals revolution ù as it is now called, the rise of production of gas in the US, of oil and gas in the rest of the world, and gas markets in general We have yet to see many other developments unfold before we can say with any certainty how it s going to happen Right now, the main project is for LNG export in the US from the Gulf coast It appears to be dedicated to supply both Asia and Europe, but it is just one of many projects, it may not have the size right now for anyone to suggest that this will make up for shortfalls in the supply Again, this is a much more complex subject with many players, with many suppliers What is clear, of course, is that to the extent that exports from the US to Europe or from any other country for that matter to Europe are sustained or increased, this will also enhance the energy security in Europe ss: I remember European Commission president Jos√© Manuel Barroso saying that the EU can t create the illusion that gas from the US is going to solve all of its problems, and there are so many different estimates of how much it could take, but in your personal opinion what s your estimate? How much time does the US need to put their shale gas export into action? afq: Now, that s quite speculative We know that there is one project approved in the US, and there are many more on different levels of probability being explored, so it is unclear And moreover, the US is increasing its own demand for its own gas, so it is too soon to tell, in my view ss: But you know how people like to speculate, and when we announced that we re having you on our program, it was going to be about gas, there is this viewer of ours who sent us this question he is asking, is there any weight to the idea that this Russian Ukraine gas conflict is being stirred up by the US, and it is to force Europe to switch suppliers? afq: Well that s just pure speculation I certainly don t agree with that point of view Let me insist, there are serious issues with serious players and actors and governments and companies The idea that with the amount of resources involved, the size of investments that are behind the oil and gas industry, and the very important relationships between states that this type of simplistic mindset would be used anyway, it s just hard to imagine ss: I do want to continue talking about this whole shale gas revolution, because Europe and Ukraine have shale gas reserves, and they are untapped Now, is the crisis situation going to advance their development what do you think? afq: Well, we have seen that any disruption to energy flows does increase attention to policies of diversification, and fracking, the possibility of using hydraulic fracking to increase oil and gas production in Europe is therefore now with more emphasis on the table, and well, it s part of the search for energy security It is indeed one of the components of diversification, it s not the only one, but, currently, given the issues that we have now seen, with respect to gas trade between Russia and Europe well it becomes more interesting to see what can be done with oil and gas ss: Well you certainly know much more about fracking than I do So how safe a technology is it? Because, we do see a lot of anti fracking protests worldwide, like Bulgaria and France have rejected shale gas due to the harm it poses to the environment What do you think of it? afq: We have seen so far practices that seem to be compatible with environmental protection There have been experiences that have not been positive, that are under study, that have been addressed so far So, it seems from what we know up to this point that production from shale resources is safe enough So far, without any instance of major disaster for the environment or major issues socially, the industry seems to be progressing well, but of course everyone should be vigilant and every effort should be made that no harm to the environment and to other civic and societal concerns is made ss: What about, like, minor disasters, not major, but minor disasters are they OK? Is it worth the big idea? afq: Well, no disaster is fine, right? None of that should be acceptable The industry, and of course the governments should make sure that this production is done in the safest way possible, that no serious affectation is made So, whatever type of accidents or concerns that have happened, both with production of shale, and production of unconventionals, or any other resource has to be addressed ss: I ve been reading up on this a little bit, and there is in Britain, in Romania and even in US locals report seismic activity in their neighborhoods, and they say their tap water catches fire I mean, that s seems crazy, and there s this issue of water pollution with the chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing Is this serious, is this big? afq: The evidence is not strong in that regard We have seen claims about earthquakes associated with fracking, about water contamination Interestingly, some of the concerns have been voiced also do involve the environment per se, but the level of traffic that is associated with the moving back and forth of trucks that are participating or are part of fracking process But, the evidence, again, so far, is not strong to suggest that the environmental effects of fracking are adverse ss: I want to get back to our part of the world, because this is what worries us the most Now, the price Ukraine pays for Russian gas is $485 per 1,000 cubic meters I just want your expert opinion, leaving the politics aside it wants to pay half the price, is that a fair request? afq: This is a commercial decision between supplier and consumer What is, I think, clear to everyone, is that the supply bringing gas and oil to market is costly, and no one can reasonably expect that production should not be compensated Likewise, it s not wise, from the producer side to think that taking measures that will affect consumers will be in anyone s interest certainly not for the long term So, a solution must be found that is fair to the producer and the consumer in this case What we are seeing is a process for finding that solution, and I m confident that it will be found ss: What would you advise, because Ukraine is unwilling to pay for gas, Russia is unwilling to budge what would your expect advice be in this dispute? They have kind of reached a deadlock right now afq: It might be a deadlock, but it s part, again, of the process, and in the past we have seen that these deadlocks are solved, this are positions that are not fixed through time, as conversations evolve, greaterlearning of what are their concerns and the possibilities will be available, and I m sure there will be a solution found To insist, producers must be compensated, without a doubt, this is not a cheap business, and consumers must also count with the certainty that they will have the energy they need The energy, as you may recall, in the international arena is more and more regarded as a human right and this is usually assumed or taken into account in the context of energy property; but, energy is crucial for development of every country, and the solution, to insist, will have to involve producers and consumers alike and this is part of the job, by the way, that of course we have to promote at the IEF ss: Yeah, but it s quite unfortunate that this basic right is not free and cannot be free Now, Ukraine wants to buy gas from Europe, as one of the solutions, and the deal is supposedly better than the one Russia is offering Does Europe have enough supplies to sell extra to Kiev, and be a reliable long term supplier, what do you think? afq: Well, right now, this doesn t seem to be evident, but I don t see why it should be a problem for any country to diversify its sources of supply, or of demand That s, as I ve said in the beginning, a sensible energy policy ss: Oh no, diversification is not a problem for anyone, I m just saying this option of buying gas from Europe instead of Russia is that a viable option as of today? That s what I m asking afq: As of today well, no Europe needs much more interconnections, and if I understand the question correctly, it involves mainly the countries of Central or Eastern Europe, and in all that part of Europe greater infrastructure is needed for distribution of gas, and investments will have to be made ss: Now, there is this other idea that s been tossed around, specifically by George Soros, I think he is the one who came up with it and then everyone sort of started talking about it It is some kind of coordinated action to bring down price of oil do you think it is a realistic possibility, will the OPEC countries agree to lose revenues in order to follow US foreign policy goals? afq: Coordinated actions to manipulate prices or to move prices in particular direction are hardly useful or beneficial What we need is markets that work better, more freely, and that are more resilient So, the actions must be to strengthen energy markets overall, so that we have also greater energy security But either on the supply or the demand side to try to move prices in particular directions beyond the promotion of price stability which is necessary for long term planning and investment I don t think it s in the interest of anyone, and certainly not useful for the promotion of economic growth ss: Now Russia and America have had ideological differences over Ukraine, and the differences are quite acute at this moment but then you see oil giants like BP and Exxon Mobil (and they actually instead of [following the] White House s line have signed agreements with Russia s Rosneft) now, we re thinking over here, don t you find it a little silly, that they are making deals with a company whose CEO can t even visit them or even pay for their lunch, because, he is banned from everywhere I know it s an absurd situation, what do you make of it? afq: I think that this is part of a conduct of business, and we have to look at it from a pure framework there is what companies are doing and what states are also involved in, and we are also going to see a process of adjustment in this regard But to qualify this as absurd that s your opinion, it s not mine ss: What s not absurd is not the fact that companies are making deals despite of politics, the absurd [thing] is that the man who is in charge of the biggest company in Russia cannot even visit the companies who is he signing the deals with That s what I meant, I just wanted to be precise Alright, thank you so much for this wonderful insight in the world of energy We were talking to Aldo Flores Quiroga, chief of the International Energy Forum We were talking about how Europe and Ukraine and also Russia can diversify their energy fields It was great talking to you That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co I will see you next time",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/167256-eu-energy-independence-ukraine/
"26 May, 2014"," China to be the most important country in XXI century Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment There s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today Follow@SophieCo_RT ss: Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us We re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? jr: Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don t like saying it, since I m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together America is driving Russia more and more to Asia That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington ss: So you re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? jr: Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly As you know, they ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn t think through the consequences Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that s not so unusual what s unusual is that America didn t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day to day basis, so now Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia I m afraid America just didn t think it through, they ve bungled, they ve acted on a day to day basis, and they ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr Obama ss: You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine another embarrassment for the US foreign policies ù Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? jr: That s an extremely good question Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia ss: But if you re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? jr: I didn t say it s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that s not that s good for Russia, that s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners ss: George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? jr: America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to I mean, if we ve sold all of our oil reserves, it s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even But, then the markets it s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn t have anything in reserve, so again, you have to ask him, I don t know, but that doesn t seem like a very viable solution to me ss: But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe will the US be able to fill the gap? jr: No America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe You don t just sort of snap your fingers and do that You don t just put in on a boat or plane, you ve got to have special ports on both sides, you ve got to have special ships, and you ve got to have natural gas in the right place Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe that s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas will they have a surplus in five years? I don t know Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it ss: I don t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? jr: Pay it back to the European Union? No, I doubt it very seriously They re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it I don t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back ss: Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair? I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? jr: Sophie, you re asking extremely good question I don t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play I don t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game I don t see what America expected to get out of it Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would ss: But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? jr: I don t see that it has hurt Russia Maybe there s something I don t know, but I don t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point ss: What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk So where does that leave dollar? jr: Again, I don t particularly like saying this, because I m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar many people now must be saying guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don t like us, they ve going to put sanctions on us! ùSo more and more people would say maybe I shouldn t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn t have my money in US dollars ùAt the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar More and more people are doing the same thing, they re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar This is just a continuing long term move away from the US dollar And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions ss: So, if you re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? jr: The US has been the world s reserve currency, has had the world s medium of exchange and so far we ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say here they are! ù then that cripples America in many many ways The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view Just recently, the space people said every country in the world has eventually collapsed ùand the way America is going, we might collapse too This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things If you read history, Sophie, it s true, it s correct When people do not have the money that they used to have they re limited in many ways You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don t have the money to pay for it anymore, you re in trouble ss: You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? jr: It s a been a long term adage in the investment world that you buy when there s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you re probably going to make a lot of money in the end unless the world comes to an end I don t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy I ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high that s what I m trying to do ss: Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now jr: I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I ll tell you I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine You don t buy something just because it s low because it can get lower and lower and lower I d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it s going to continue to be in turmoil If you ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10 15 years you know what I m talking about Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now ss: So what are you thinking how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? jr: I would suspect that it s going to America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said No, we re not going to do this anymore, we don t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia ù Europeans don t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it s doing nothing It doesn t hurt the Russians doesn t seem to There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don t suspect that this is going to last much longer ss: Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you re looking at non energy companies Is it right? jr:  I have plenty of energy investment, so I m not investing in energy companies in Russia I m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy ss: Well, that s what I was going to ask you what do you invest in, in Russia? jr: I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares I own shares of the Moscow s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I m looking for other areas to invest I don t have any others yet, but I m looking ss: Look, I ve got a sense from what you re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia Is that s how it works, exactly? jr: I said, if there are more sanctions ù Washington keeps saying they re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will That s what they say they re going to do, they probably will do it And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while I have no idea of what s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak But it often does ss: Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well known basic strategy but you re not afraid for the long term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? jr: No, of course My point about sanctions is that they don t seem to be hurting Russia, I don t see that there s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don t go along with them, or don t go along with them in a big way I don t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short term It s just that I don t see it ss: With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? jr: Yes I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you ve probably know Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren t very viable, that they haven t hurt Russia in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they re doing more business with China China is a pretty successful economy, so it s not hurting, and in some ways it s actually helping Russia, because it s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals It s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars ss: Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let s say, during your lifetime? jr: During my lifetime? ss: Yep jr: Well, I hope I ll live a long time, Sophie, so yes I hope I ll live a long, long time ss: Well, we hope too But tell me one more thing: do you think there s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? jr: Oh, I m sure we will If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they re going to take advantage of it So, no, it s happening ss: You have said that you re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center you really think it has what it takes? jr: No, what I ve said was that I m astonished that they think that, that they re going to try I don t know if they can make that Mr Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center I m astonished I ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive Whether it works or not in 10 15 years? I don t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center ss: Talking about 10 15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age Is that where the future is, in China? jr: In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world ss: Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? jr: Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life I ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years I do think I see opportunities and therefore I m investing ss: So when did you first come to Russia? jr: I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years I knew I wouldn t work But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I ve started investing in Russia ss: So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? jr: No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn t as bad as it had been for 46 years ss: I want to ask one more question about China I m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn t suffered any crises yet But, it might at some point, like all markets do so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? jr: Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it s going to affect some people If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering That s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now It s just like if America has problems; it affects a lot of people If Japan has problems, it affects some people So there is no question that China will have problems I don t know what, or when, or why but every country has problems, somewhere along the line What is a little bit unusual is that it s been a long time since China has had major problems That is extremely unusual That s one reason I m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I m waiting in case there s a problem coming out of China If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I m smart enough to buy more china ss: Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/161436-china-russia-investment-rogers/

To discuss that, I m now joined by David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Dr Weinberg, thank you very much for taking time to talk to us David Weinberg:Thank you for having me ob: Now, the organisation you work for was set up after 9/11 to promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism ù Is there any country that is more antithetic to all those objectives than Saudi Arabia? dw: Sure, Syria, Iran, lots of countries But certainly there s a big gap between the values of the US and the values of the Saudis It s a relationship that s been strained by the conflicting values of the two sides ob: But my question was whether Saudi Arabia really takes the cake for essentially lacking all the three elements that are mentioned in the purposes of the organisation that you work for Again, there is not much in the way of pluralism, they don t value democracy at all, and when it comes to the ideology espoused by Saudi Arabia not only it condones terrorism, it actually supports it dw: Yeah, I mean look, dictatorship is not a contest, but if it were, the Saudis would be doing great My organisation has actually been quite active on this issue For instance, this week we put out a report highlighting the hate that is continually, still being taught in Saudi Arabia s public schools through their textbook system So, we certainly are no friends of the Saudis on this issue, and we certainly hope that the President had some very serious conversations about human rights behind closed doors, while he was in Saudi Arabia ob: Well this is a very mild way of putting it But Saudi Arabia is not officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism And yet it is well known that it is the largest source of financing when it comes to militant jihadi groups such as the Taliban or Al Qaeda And I hardly need to mention that it is Americans who suffered a great deal from the terror plots hatched, and sometimes executed with the help of Saudi money Fifteen out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals And when you think about it, had they been Russians, I think we could have had an outbreak of World War III by now But with the Saudis, again, it s always let s be patient with them ù And it may be a personal question, but for a country like Russia, which often finds itself on the receiving end of US condemnation without hurting a single American, it s very difficult to understand why would Americans let the Saudis off the hook so easily, given how many Americans were hurt in 9/11? dw: Absolutely Well, you know, I think it s reflected, first of all, in public opinion numbers Saudi Arabia has absolutely dreadful numbers when you as the American public what they think of the other country But when you say Saudi money going to sponsor terrorism, I m curious whether you mean state money going to sponsor terrorism, or whether you mean private money going to sponsor terrorism? Which do you mean? ob: Well Dr Weinberg, I mean both Because obviously, there are some private sponsors of terror groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Lebanon They used to sponsor insurgency in Chechnya as well But official government structures in Saudi Arabia are not the most transparent, so you can never be sure that official money is not being used for the same purpose dw: But is there evidence of official money? I don t think so ob: Well, I think Prince Bandar, for one, is quite involved in sponsoring various rebel groups in Syria And I guess we can argue about the definition of terrorism and freedom fighting, but I think it is pretty clear that Saudi Arabia is supporting groups that use terror as a tactic in Syria So, that would be, sort of, evidence, wouldn t it? dw: Sure, I mean I think that some of Saudi Arabia s identified clients in Syria are extremely unappealing For instance, the extremist group most convincingly tied to Saudi governmental assistance is called Jaysh al Islam, or the Army of Islam, which is led by a man called Zahran Alloush, whose father is a preacher in Saudi Arabia, and who advocates ethnic cleansing of Shiites and opposes democracy This is an organisation that by and large is repulsive and antithetical to western values, and it s an organisation that the US has been, to my understanding, pushing the Saudis behind the scenes to reduce their support for ob: You just mentioned how little support there is for the Saudis and their tactics among the American public And yet American politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, seem to be sort of welcoming, or at least tight lipped, when it comes to criticism of the Saudi officials Why do you think that is? dw: Well, I think we need to differentiate between the executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue Because, I think the legislative branch has been quite comfortable raising concerns about Saudi policies that conflict with universal human rights and democratic values So for instance, members of Congress for both parties, in the last week and a half, have issued letters to the President, calling on him to make human rights part of the discussion, and to make religious freedom part of the discussion when he went to Saudi Arabia So I do think that American politicians of both stripes, be it Democratic or Republican, are not reluctant to speak out about this issue But I do think that when either party is in power at the White House, they certainly have incentives to try elicit regional cooperation from the Saudis, and unfortunately sometimes that means human rights reform issues get kicked a little bit lower on the priority list Just as that sometimes is the case in US relations with Russia American officials would actually like to be raising these issues even more often than they do with Russia, but because of Russia s important role as a geopolitical power, don t even raise it as much as they actually would, as surprising as that may be for some of your viewers to hear ob: But Dr Weinberg, I wonder how much more often those issues could be raised? Because I think human rights in Russia is one of the most popular issues for American politicians, whether of the executive or legislative branch But going back to Saudi Arabia, President Obama has just visited Riyadh What do you think he was hoping to achieve there? dw: Well I think the messaging coming out of the White House really focused on trying to dispel the image that there s a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United States So even as the President s plane was pulling into Saudi Arabia, his deputy national security advisor was giving a briefing to the press corps, and he was trying to emphasise that things have gotten better in the US Saudi relationship since the fall, when the Saudis were upset So, not denying that the Saudis have been upset with the US, but trying to argue that that dispute over Iran, over Syria, over other issues, has been resolved or at least significantly reduced As to whether that narrative is going to be seen as persuasive, either by the media or the general public, we still have yet to see ob: Now the biggest strain, as many analysts have identified, in this bilateral relationship is Americas reluctance to fully back the Saudis in their existential fight against the Shia forces of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, possibly Iraq And this fight that the Saudis are in is not driven by money, it is not driven by political calculations It is driven by genuine values, however archaic and bigoted they may be And I wonder, given the existential nature of this fight, whether Americans can really reason with the Saudis at this point, or is it increasingly a case of the tail wagging the dog here dw: Well, I certainly would agree with you with regard to your argument that this is an area where the US really has some difficulties satisfying the Saudis fully You know, the Saudi public sees what s going on in Syria as the greatest humanitarian calamity of our age And that s not my words, that s the Saudi Foreign Minister s words And so what they see are Shiites, whom they already have dehumanised in their education and religious system as heretics, slaughtering Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, slaughtering Sunni civilians as well as rebels And so, in that regard, the Saudis want the US to decapitate the regime in Syria, at the very least by toppling it And so the Saudis are not going to be satisfied when they see the US pursuing an approach that actually, in some regards on the battlefield, is quite similar to Russia s strategy, which is to have this conflict turn into a stalemate The Russians want to enable Assad to not be toppled, to outlast the conflict And the US wants to ensure, like Russia purportedly, a political solution to this conflict, by ensuring that the rebels are not fully marginalised on the battlefield But when it comes to actually toppling the Assad regime militarily, the US administration has held back to some extent until now And we ll just have to see whether the Saudis can convince them to take a harder line on this It certainly could happen, especially if there s no progress at Geneva ob: Since you mentioned Russia s intentions in Syria, I think Russia would much have preferred not having this conflict to begin with I think this conflict was initiated and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US to begin with So it is those two countries that actually opted for changing the status quo But rather than going in depth into Syria, I would like to ask you very quickly this relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was founded on a quite explicit agreement that Washington would defend the Gulf state in exchange for oil contracts And the US no longer needs that much Saudi oil, and the nature of security threats has also changed So I wonder if it s possible that, sooner or later, the US and Saudi Arabia will have to part ways? dw: Well, first of all, I d like to address something that you said right before your question, which is how this conflict started As Americans see it, the way this conflict started was a Russian supported dictator, Bashar al Assad, slaughtered his people when they went out on the street and peaceably demonstrated As well as arresting and torturing teenagers So that is how we see how this conflict started As to whether the US and the Saudis ob: Well, you see this conflict this way because you are told that this conflict started this way As somebody who was on the ground in Syria, all those three years ago, I can tell you that there were snipers, there were provocation, there were Saudi agents there on the scene So obviously the tactics of Bashar al Assad are not to be defended, and his indiscriminate use of force But I wonder if the US would react in any different way if the constitutional law and order were threatened? For once, if I can remind you of the search operation for the Boston bombers, if you remember a couple of years ago The whole city of Boston was blocked to find two men, police was used and he was shot dead So, I think Americans use force quite extensively when their own security is compromised, but they for some reason deny that right to other countries But I would still like you to answer that question about whether you see any chance for the US and Saudi Arabia parting ways geopolitically, given how different their value systems really are? dw: Well, having lived in Boston, having actually lived on the same block as the Boston bomber, having been a graduate student at MIT in the past where a police officer was slaughtered by the bombers no doubt Americans take terrorism seriously As to whether the Saudis and the US are going to part ways, the triumphalism of the shale energy boom to some extent is overwrought Because the US, just as Russia, just as other countries are in the global economy, are dependant on stability in the global price of oil And in that regard, until industrialised countries such as the US, such as Russia, such as the countries of east and south Asia, have fuel choice about the fuel they put in their automobiles, we re going to be continually dependant on the security in the Gulf ob: I see Dr Weinberg, we have to take a short break now, but when we come back the United States has rediscovered its good old enemy in Russia What does this mean for the future of US Saudi relations? That s coming up in a few moments on Worlds Apart ob: Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the love hate relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia with David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies dw: That s a great way of putting it ob: Dr Weinberg, you just heard, I turned it in terms of love and hate, and I m not sure about the love, but to see the examples of hatred, all you need to do is to open the Saudi school textbooks, which you alluded to earlier, that for decades have been spewing vitriol at everything Western And as you mentioned, you wrote a very interesting report recently on how lenient the US has been recently with Saudi Arabia on this issue But I wonder, what is the real reason for Saudi procrastination in removing all those vitriolic passages from their textbooks? dw: Well, first of all, I d like to say that I don t think that the US has been uniquely lax when it comes to raising Saudi textbooks In fact, I think it s done more than any other government in its exchanges with the Saudi authorities on this issue For instance, I saw no indication that this was part of the conversation when Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin met last year in Moscow So I think there are things that other countries could do That having been said, the US has more leverage that it could potentially use with Saudi Arabia on this issue And in that regard, I really do with the US would do more ob: Well Dr Weinberg, the reason why President Putin may not raise this issue, or other issues, with foreign visitors is because Russia doesn t make the promotion of democracy the pillar of its foreign policy It s the US that does And if I m not mistaken, the State Department first noted a problem with the Saudi textbooks all the way back in 2003 And ever since then, the Saudis have assumed this very typical approach for them of not saying no outright, but not delivering either And my question to you is whether they see any practical gain in essentially indoctrinating their youth in this mindset, whether they do it on purpose as a part of state ideology? dw: Well, I think Saudi Arabia, like any country, does have some internal debates, even as an absolute monarchy But that having been said, I do think that the Saudi authorities bear responsibility for what s in these books, especially because these books are printed on an annual basis by their Ministry of Education So they are to blame for what s published in their texts The Saudi monarch, and the Saudi royal family, and the government say that these books have been reformed, that they re being improved But when they say that, they only take the lowest hanging fruit They take some of the hatred out of elementary school books They say that they spent money on teacher training, to moderate teachers They say that they re increasing the number of women in universities But the reason that they don t take this on more seriously, I think, is because they see more benefit in not upsetting their conservative, reactionary preachers, than they see in telling their children a more tolerant view of the world and keeping their children from being indoctrinated So I do think that it really will take diplomatic consequences in Saudi Arabia s foreign relations with the international community for this to change ob: Now, this violent extremism that children are being taught in Saudi public schools is bad when it is targeted at you, but when it targets some of your rivals, it may come in handy And here I would like to shift gears a little bit and discuss the Saudi US relations vis a vis Russia, because there are quite a few historic examples when this partnership was very successful in undermining Moscow I wonder whether these recent tensions that we saw between Russia and the West, and the US in particular, could lead President Obama to re evaluate or rethink his relationship with Saudi Arabia dw: Actually, I think US Russian relations in the last month have added an extra strain to to the US Saudi relationship Because the Saudis wish that the US had been firmer with Russia over the Crimea Just as they saw the US choosing to pursue a negotiated deal with Russia over Syria s chemical weapons in the fall, this was an area where US, Russia I d like to say at least averting away from more direct conflict actually came at some cost to the US in its relationship with the Saudis Similarly, the US helped turned the tide of the battle in Afghanistan in the 80s, against the Soviet Union, by introducing a large number of MANPADS man portable air defence systems that the Mujahiddeen used against the Soviet air force The US hasn t gotten much credit from the Russians for something that they ve done, which is showing some restraint when it comes to MANPADS in Syria today The Saudis have been itching to introduce those in massive numbers, unsupervised, without any sort of permissive action links, without any sort of way for the US, for instance, to disable them if they fall in the hands of Al Qaeda But the US has actually held relatively firm on that to date, and that s an area in which the US hasn t gotten much credit ob: Well, Dr Weinberg, I think this is a very novel interpretation of both recent events in history Because if it wasn t for the US and Saudi Arabia, those weapons wouldn t be in Syria in the first place So I don t see how we can credit the US for not restraining Saudi Arabia well enough Going back to Ukraine, there have been reports that Washington has already reached out to Saudi Arabia to provide some of the $15 billion promised to Ukraine And while Saudi Arabia doesn t have any intrinsic interest in Ukraine, what it is interested in is seeing Washington toughen up on Syria And I wonder if we could see any sort of Ukraine for Syria swap here essentially Saudi Arabia giving the money for Ukraine, but Washington in return doing what Riyadh wants it to do in Syria? dw: You know, actually the most persuasive tit for tat of this sort that I ve seen has been a recent story in the Washington Post, suggesting that the US is finally considering doubling its training of vetted Syrian rebels, to be funded by the Qatari treasury So if there s going to be a tit for tat, in this regard, that s actually where I ve seen some suggestions that it might happen ob: Now, Russia is a natural rival for the US in Ukraine, and for Saudi Arabia in Syria so much so that George Soros has already suggested that the two team up in driving the oil prices down And of course, this move proved to be very effective back in the 80s, when these two countries colluded in driving the oil prices down, and that proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union Do you think that could work this time around? dw: No, I don t think there s persuasive US Saudi collusion on the energy price that actually influences Saudi energy policy The Saudis make their oil production decisions based on internal budgetary issues, and they do this also by looking at the domestic situation in Saudi Arabia and making outlays to keep their public quiet So that, I think, is actually going to be the biggest driver of Saudi oil policy But, you know, they can be hypocritical about this too, just as the US can be hypocritical about where and when it supports democracy, just as Russia can be hypocritical about where and when it supports sovereignty ob: I wonder if we could consider one more way of how the Saudis and Americans could exact their vengeance, or their revenge on Russia, and that would be by supporting terror groups They used to do that in Chechnya, as I mentioned before, and they could probably do the same in Crimea, which has a somewhat sizeable population, couldn t they? dw: Well actually, the Muslim population in Crimea is significantly smaller before Stalin ethnically cleansed the place So actually, I think that leverage is much smaller now ob: But, just fore the benefit of our viewers, as far as I know, I may be mistaken but back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Crimea was a very popular destination for wounded Chechen rebels First, because of the geographic proximity to Chechnya, and also because of the somewhat lax security policy of the Ukrainian authorities I think it is estimated that at the moment, there are around 5,000 followers of the Wahhabi branch of Islam in the Crimea, and I guess you wouldn t need even that many to stir trouble? dw: Well, you know, first of all it is important to distinguish between people s religious views, be they intolerant or not, and whether they re actually engaged in acts of violence But certainly I do think that when an intolerant brand of religion is promoted in places abroad, including in elements of the Soviet Union, there are consequences for that down the road, absolutely ob: Well one of the natural consequences for Moscow would be to deepen its ties with Tehran, especially given the very politically correct reaction of the Rouhani government to Crimea s joining Russia But I wonder if that will deepen the trenches even more in this geopolitical rivalry? dw: It s absolutely possible, but I do think it conflicts with what the Rouhani government s strategy is in Iran, which is a little bit different than what the Supreme Leader s strategy is in Iran The Supreme Leader s strategy is direct confrontation with the US The Rouhani government s strategy is to maintain many of the Islamic republic s policies, but to try and achieve some sort of rapprochement with the international community They may not be ready to pay the cost of what that entails, and they ve given no indication that they re ready to stop the IRGC s terrorist activities in places like the Levant and the Gulf And that s actually what motivates the Saudis to push hard when it comes to Iran issues, and something that the US, personally I think, could be doing a little more on Certainly Russia could do more on it as well ob: Well, Dr Weinberg, unfortunately we have to leave it there, I appreciate your being on the show dw: Thank you, Oksana ob: And to our viewers keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and I hope to see you again same place, same time here on Worlds Apart",https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/usa-saudi-russia-relations-165/
"11 Oct, 2013",American truckers are putting Washington DC on notice,"There seems to be no end to the political theater in Washington DC But what began as a simple game of chicken between the White House and the Republican opposition has quickly morphed into a game of political Russian roulette Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK A nation polarized, stuck in the ultimate political gridlock
 imaginable over federal spending As America waits for a
 resolution to the federal government shutdown, an unlikely
 community has decided to put their money where their mouth is By
 all accounts, they are the most under appreciated industry in
 today s America Truck drivers are the backbone of the American
 economy Everything Americans own, buy and need is delivered to
 them by trucks daily, yet few take any notice of the people
 behind the wheels That could all change after this weekend, as
 America gets a taste of its first ever diesel driven flash mob According the organizers at RideForTheConstitution org, over
 3,000 truckers, thousands more demonstrators on foot, have
 already RSVP d to converge on the nation s capital starting this
 Friday, Oct 11th, as they plan to slow traffic into Washington
 DC, and present a list of demands to law makers there Somebody had to do it, ùexplained Zeeda Andrews, a former
 country singer and Mac Truck spokesmodel Organizers have been
 surprised by the amount of support they ve gathered since their
 campaign gained visibility last month I didn t think it would be this big Maybe that s because the
 American people are just fed up It s more than just a trucking
 issue now, we are in a constitutional crisis and something has to
 be done, and it s common people like myself with nothing to
 lose, who are going to get something done ù Considering the fact that most people have never sat in the cab
 of an 18 wheeler in their life, the DC truckers have somehow
 managed to attract a pretty wide appeal Already, parallel
 protests have sprung up, set to take place in most major US
 cities on Friday and Saturday Larry Klayman, a former US Justice Department prosecutor, and
 founder of Freedom Watch, has also volunteered his support for
 the DC truckers campaign This past summer Klayman represented
 the families of Navy SEAL Team 6 who were killed when their
 Chinook helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan in August 2011,
 following the White House s rather incredible raid on the alleged
 bin Laden lair in Abbotabad, Pakistan I m throwing my support behind this campaign because we ve
 have had enough Our government has broken away from the people,
 and our grievances are not being heard, so we need to get out
 there and make it clear to the powers that be that be whether
 it s President Obama, Speaker of the House John Boehner, or
 whether it s majority leader Harry Reid in the Senate that we
 are simply not going to take it anymore The time has come to
 save our country, and we ll do it in the style of Ghandi, Lech
 Walesa, and Martin Luther King ù, said Klayman Organisers will join Klayman today at the steps of the US Capitol
 building to present their list of demands At the top of that
 list is an appeal for economic survival, with a call for
 immediate action on the spiralling cost of diesel and harassment
 from federal regulatory agencies which is not only driving up
 costs of goods and services, but also killing transportation
 profits, pushing independent truckers into fuel poverty, and
 ultimately out of business Beyond this emerges a broader spectrum movement of political
 dissent, which echoes concerns heard from many different quarters
 in the US As far as civil disobedience goes, their protest is no walk in
 the park Logistically speaking, it s a nightmare Then there s
 the political demands, which, in terms of the average Americans 
 attention deficit disorder, are comprehensive, and not exactly
 media friendly especially for the likes of MSNBC and FOX But
 unlike the much celebrated, but highly ineffective Occupy
 Movement, which ended up being a controlled street party whose
 indelible mark on society was that it produced a boiled down
 abstract of class warfare The 1% vs the 99% the DC
 Truckers have a fairly sharp libertarian agenda, coupled with a
 detailed list of constitutional demands Unless you ve been hiding in a bunker lately, you would know that
 something is serious brewing in America In the last year alone,
 the White House has been dodging and fighting to stave off a
 seemingly endless daisy chain of scandals In addition to the
 Navy SEAL Team 6 cover up, there is a not so small issue of the
 White House using the IRS to target the President s political
 opponents, the horrific Benghazi cover up involving a dead US
 Ambassador and servicemen, and gun running from Libya to Syria,
 and the US support of al Qaeda fighters in Syria In addition to these and other federal interventions hurting
 truckers livelihoods, the campaign feels that all
 unconstitutional federal laws and agencies should be wiped from
 the books They include the National Defense Authorization Act
 (NDAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transport
 Security Agency (TSA), and The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) US talk radio host Pete Santilli has volunteered to help the
 truckers get their message out over the airwaves If you look at the list of demands, regardless of where you
 are in the political spectrum, you would not disagree with: stop
 supporting al Qaeda (in Syria), don t raise the debt ceiling 
 and threaten us that if we don t print another trillion dollars
 that they ll collapse out system that s a forceful means to
 steal money from us President Obama needs to be held accountable
 for crimes committed against the United States and Congress needs
 to hear those crimes ù The beauty of this event is that it is open and nonpartisan 
 it absolutely cuts right through party lines Every American can
 participate in this ù Santilli adds here, John McCain and
 Lindsey Graham they must go Any of these unconstitutional
 legislators, anyone who has committed unconstitutional acts in
 office, must vacate voluntarily If they refuse to go, we want to
 cut off their money supply so they won t be able to make millions
 off us anymore ù The Truckers are not without their enemies, who are keen to
 discredit them, silence them, or both As their campaign goes viral, so goes the media shooting match 
 The campaign has been directly targeted by George Soros funded
 leftwing outlet, Media Matters, who have been busy digging up old
 Facebook posts and likes from personal pages of Ride For
 The Constitution s organisers, in effect, waging a character
 assassination against them When running a 21st century activist campaign, one must also
 beware of deadly communitarian policing, also known as community guidelines ùpolicy Ride For The Constitution s Facebook page was live only six days
 when it received 86,000 likes, only to be promptly pulled down by
 the social network The same happened with its Twitter account,
 which was pulled down after only 6 days In both cases, accounts were frozen because of an anonymous
 complaint Santilli says he s mounting a legal challenge against one of the
 social networks It seems like the First Amendment doesn t apply on social
 networks You work hard to build up a huge audience, only to see
 it disappear in an instant because a few political enemies
 anonymously complain that they were somehow offended ù As with all political movements through history, the pain
 normally starts in the wallet Rising toll road charges and
 inflated diesel prices are forcing many out of America s trucking
 industry In 2013, the reality is that drivers are losing their
 trucks and losing their business After labour, diesel fuel is
 the second highest expense for motor carriers, and can reach as
 much as much as 20% of transport s total operating costs Organisers Zeeda Andrews and Michael JB Schaffner
 concluded in their joint statement on what they feel is a
 national crisis: By no means are these the only issues that need action, to be
 resolved There are many, many more issues that continue to
 plague this industry, as new regulations create even more
 contradictions in law As per the fourteenth amendment of our
 Constitution, No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
 abridge the privileges, or immunities of Citizens of the United
 States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty,
 or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
 within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ù ""So let these issues be the beginning of where we take a
 stand, not just as The American Drivers, but as Free and
 Independent Americans, protecting what our Constitution preserves
 for us ù At the very least Washington DC might be in for a shock this
 weekend Call it shock therapy for the political class At its
 best, it could jump start real American discourse nationwide Let the ride begin",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-economy-government-shutdown-truck-992/
"26 Aug, 2013",The world according to the global power brokers,"When the World Economic Forum released its 2013 Global Risks Report earlier this year, it included an interesting array of proposals which should raise eyebrows and be taken very seriously Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi The World Economic Forum (WEF) used risk management exercises to
 address many of the challenges that we all know about growing
 social and political violence, the West s on going financial
 collapse, food and water shortages, and the Elite s all time
 favorite global terrorism ù However, they also worked out proposals for government ùand some rather uncanny X Factors ùwhich, coming as they
 do from one of the global powers favorite think tanks, we would
 do well to read between the lines As German playwright Johann W Goethe once remarked, coming
 events cast their shadows forwards ù This is particularly
 true when those shadows are cast by global power brokers in a
 position to drive and control those coming events, according to
 their hearts desire, and here we are talking about the World
 Economic Forum (WEF), founded in 1971 Chaired by Klaus Schwab,
 who sits on David Rockefeller s Trilateral Commission, means he
 has direct access to the families of Rockefeller, Bush, Soros,
 Kissinger, Brzezinski, Rothschild, Lazard, Harriman, Montbatten,
 Warburg, Schiff, Borb√≥n, and Orange Indeed, it is from behind these curtains that the global elite
 are planning to impose a world government on all mankind; by
 designing, planning, and executing the macro changes that they
 need to impose upon all countries each according to need and in
 their due time as the process of privatizing global power rams
 forwards on a global scale Two interesting issues are being highlighted by the elite through
 the WEF: the re engineering of national governments, and the
 introduction of so called X Factors ùinto the collective
 psyche Subtitled Lessons Learned from around the World; Global
 Agenda Council on the Future of Government ù, this WEF piece
 written in 2011 echoes the Council on Foreign Relations academic,
 Richard Gardner s seminal essay written almost forty years ago on
 the hard road to the new world order ù, where he
 recommended sovereign Nation states should be eroded piece by
 piece ù This Report urges governments to align to the future by
 adapting and continuously evolving to create value ù, adding
 that governments need to stay relevant by being responsive to
 rapidly changing conditions and citizens expectations, and build
 capacity to operate effectively in complex, interdependent
 networks of organizations and systems across the public, private
 and non profit sectors to co produce public value ù It then goes on to recommend what is needed today is Flatter,
 Agile, Streamlined and Tech enabled (FAST) government ù Translating this think tankese mumbo jumbo into English, we get: Flatter = less authority; less sovereignty; Agile = more malleable; controllable; Streamlined = less meaningful; less powerful Tech enabled = subservient to those who own/operate/control
 technological R&D Need we remind ourselves that the true mission of sovereign
 nation states is not to adapt and continuously evolve ùwhich, again, is think tankese for aligning to the coming
 world government, or else ù? The true and inalienable functions of sovereign nation states and
 their governments are to: Promote the Common Good of the vast majority of the people over
 and above the interests and greed of powerful local and/or
 foreign minorities, that are embedded in local, public and
 private power structures, and Defend the country s national interest in today s dangerous, even
 deadly, world made so precisely because of small and
 illegitimately powerful minorities that have everywhere usurped
 far too much power President Putin of Russia understands this only too well; so does
 president Xi Jinping of China † Most other countries,
 however, either never learned this fundamental lesson or seem to
 have forgotten it The global elites suggest a number of measures to align civil
 service systems to the requirements of their proposed FAST
 Governments based on such factors as carefully planned workforce
 reductions coupled with the significant organizational,
 technological and workforce advances inherent in FAST governments
 to build slim and streamlined organizations that can thrive in
 the new world order Adaptive governments that share labor,
 services and resources through networked approaches and Gov 2 0
 strategies can remain slim while delivering on their mission in
 effective and innovative ways ù Yes, I know: this sounds far more like a Corporate Annual Report
 than a geopolitical piece for creative statesmanship The authors challenge governments to design and implement two
 new complementary ways of assessing governments performance The
 first set of measures consists of a holistic approach to
 government performance along the four axes defined earlier as
 FAST † The second set of measures focuses on measuring
 the value of such transformation to citizens ù If where it says government ù, you read corporations ù, and where it says citizens ù, you
 read clients ù, then you get a blueprint for private
 government Prying farther into what the future holds in store for us, Mr 
 Schwab s team partnered with the editors of Britain s leading
 science journal, Nature, and came up with a series of X
 Factors ù, five of which are truly revolutionary
 game changers Just take a look at them, and then let s infer what might lie
 behind the curtain: 1) Runaway climate change: Is it possible that we have
 already passed a point of no return and that Earth s atmosphere
 is tipping rapidly into an inhospitable state? ùThis
 ties in nicely with the Elite s proposal of imposing a Global
 Carbon Tax backed by the coming world government s legal
 framework, which will serve as a tool to control every country,
 region, city, and individual by allocating carbon credits ù based
 on their carbon footprint ù, thereby globally controlling
 all permissible activity 2) Significant cognitive enhancement: Ethical dilemmas akin
 to doping in sports could start to extend into daily working
 life; an arms race in the neural enhancement of combat troops
 could also ensue ùSuch scientific and technological
 breakthroughs are all basically controlled through the global
 network of mega corporate high tech laboratories † We have
 an example in Monsanto s patenting of genetically modified seeds;
 the leitmotiv is to impose uncrackable, unhackable, high tech and
 secret encoding over just about every resource on planet Earth:
 from seeds to sports competitions; from NSA eavesdropping to
 military gear The coming world government will reserve for its
 exclusive use specific override code factors that will allow them
 to take over communications systems, power grids and aircraft 
 military and civilian, in flight and on the ground (9/11
 Conspiracy Theorists take note!) 3) Rogue deployment of geo engineering: Technology is now
 being developed to manipulate the climate; a state or private
 individual could use it unilaterally ùAs if we
 did not know about Project HAARP High Frequency Active Auroral
 Research Program based in Alaska and Norway which has been
 undoubtedly playing dirty tricks all over the world, creating
 droughts and flooding!! It appears that HAARP installations can generate directed high
 power electromagnetic standing waves over specific geographical
 areas that interfere with weather fronts, stopping rain clouds in
 their tracks This can lead to too much rain on one side
 (floods) and too little rain on the other (droughts) of these
 invisible standing waves Also, as geologists well know, certain high power precisely aimed
 radio frequencies can be made to resonate with tectonic plates
 that are ready to slip ù; so with the right data the HAARP
 weapon might be used to trigger earthquakes/seaquakes that are
 ready to happen ù 4) Costs of living longer: Medical advances are prolonging
 life, but long term palliative care is expensive Covering the
 costs associated with old age could be a struggle ùA
 warning: The mysterious and anonymous Georgia Guidestones erected
 in 1980 in Ebert, Georgia which read like the global
 commandments, starts off by recommending the elites maintain
 humanity under 500 000 000, in perpetual balance with
 nature ù † Global depopulation is a coming ¶ 5) Discovery of alien life: Proof of life s existence
 elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological
 implications for human belief systems ùWhat a
 convincing way to bring on world government almost
 overnight! † In a Speech at the UN in 1987, former US
 President Ronald Reagan asked how quickly our differences
 worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from
 outside this world And yet, I ask is not an alien force ALREADY
 among us? ùHmmm ¶ Contact with alien life forms would demand a unified
 representation for all of mankind; yes indeed: a world
 government † And, of course, over the past 70 years,
 Hollywood has mentally programmed the world to accept that any
 such contact would be with the Elite s key representative, the
 United States If one day soon little green men from Mars were to
 tell any human, take me to your leader ù, the proper
 landing strip will, of course, be the White House lawn The think tankese conclusion: The Global Risks Report is the
 flagship research publication of the World Economic Forum s Risk
 Response Network providing an independent platform for
 stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate on building
 resilience to global risks ù Translation: Whoever controls the global agenda, the politically
 correct limits of debate and technological change, has an awfully
 huge edge over the rest of mankind, whether they are grouped by
 regions, nations, ideologies, demographics, raw material wealth,
 or whatever Actually, all this rings much more like an attempt at generating
 self fulfilling prophecies, rather than on trying to understand
 how to tackle the world s future problems Goethe was right: coming events do cast their shadows
 forward † The global elites mad drive to impose world
 government on all of us is exactly that: an increasingly dark
 shadow bent on dragging us all into the darkest night",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/world-economy-power-brokers-forum-996/
"19 Apr, 2013",Gold bounces back but for good?,"Gold is on the rebound after a 4 5% drop this week, and the plunge has triggered serious concern about the condition of the global economy The Comex index has passed the $1,400 mark, gaining 21 5 points
to $1,412 60 an ounce at 15:17 DST We are already seeing a strong response to the fall in
prices, with a sharp pick up in physical gold sales by investors
and retail consumers in the two key consumer markets India and
China, ùMark Pervan, head of commodity strategy at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group, wrote toBloombergtoday While the value of the biggest gold producers declined by $169
billion, jewelers took advantage of the 30 year record low gold
prices to stock up for anticipated high demand retail and jewelry
sales Chinese and Indian jewelers are optimistic that gold will
rebound as much as 29% by December 2013, to as high as $1,800 an
ounce, as demand increases, according to billionaire Indian jeweler
T S Kalyanaraman,Reutersreported There s been continued buying interest, particularly into
China, ùNigel Moffatt, treasurer of Australia s Perth Mint said
on Bloomberg Television Friday Americans took advantage of the price dip to buy stock in a
historically high yielding investment In April, the US Mint sold 153,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins, a three year high, according to its website The recent slump in gold has been paired with disturbing
economic data forecasting significant slowing in some of the
world s largest economies † the US,China, andRussia The gold drops are signaling concerns about global growth, 
said Mohamed El Erian, the co chief investment officer of PIMCO,
which oversees $2 trillion in assets,Reutersreported Commodities have been sending the signal on growth for a
while, and now even louder, El Erian added Gold has certainly been the loudest of the flailing indexes,
after it plunged 14% in the first two April sessions, hitting a
30 year low as slowed growth data from the US and China trickled
in Prices also dropped as the Cypriot bailout payment plan toyed
with the idea of selling 75% of their reserves to help finance the
bailout, which spooked investors other cash strapped European
states, like Spain and Portugal, might do the same The economic slowdown was confirmed by the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday when it trimmed back its forecast on
economic growth in 2013, down to 3 3% from the earlier 3 5%
projection Citigroup predicted, and was correct, that 2013 would be the
first year when commodity prices at the end of the year were lower
than at the beginning Citigroup predicted the end of the super cycle when rising
prices commodities supersede demand As growth slows, governments are scrambling to find a way to
stay afloat Most governments are doing this via cash stimulus 
simply printing more money to avoid deflation, the Bank of Japan
the premier example The recent retreats in gold, oil, and other precious metals and
energy stocks, are evidence to many of a weak and maybe slightly
unstable economy Because metals and energy are so closely tied
to industrial growth, a decline in their demand can provide an
accurate reading of an global economic performance As inflation falls, this in turn reduces the value of gold as a
fortification against rising prices If investors forecast an
inflation dip, gold will also lose its value Because the global economy is on the downside of a global
credit bubble, it seems unreasonable to expect abnormal
inflation, said Richard Bernstein, the head of an investment
advisory firm in New York,Reutersreported Gold, a major investment for both individuals and institutions,
provides a viable alternative to currency that their government can
just print more of It also provides and investment alternative to
stocks George Soros cut his holdings in SPDR Gold Trust by 55% last
quarter He predicted the prices would tumble, and wasn t sure how
quickly they d recover The title of JPMogran s gold futures report is The slide in
global inflation may not be over Morgan Stanley has cut its 2013 gold forecast by 16%, down to
$1,487, as investors continue their selling frenzy The sell off has all the hallmarks of panic driven, stale long
liquidation, stop loss and capitulation selling in the face of a
concerted short sale ù Peter Richardson, a Morgan Stanley analyst,
wrote in a report According to JPMorgan s report, it s not a time to invest, or
reinvest in gold Merrill Lynch recently warned that gold could fall to $1,200
before stabilizing, citing fears of disinflation combined with
news of potential central bank gold selling, ù in their Tuesday
report Even at these levels, gold is still not attractive The odds
favor the bull market being over, said Jim McDonald, chief
investment strategist at Chicago based Northern Trust Global
