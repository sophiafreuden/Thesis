"30 Dec, 2020",Director of Soros-funded HRW slammed for accusing Hungary of ‘scoring political points’ with imports of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine,"Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth has taken heat online after he suggested that the only reason behind Hungary’s purchase of  some 6,000 vials of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is to curry favor with Vladimir Putin “As the European Union unrolls proven versions of the coronavirus vaccine, Hungary's PM Orban, apparently to score political points with Putin, imports 6,000 doses of the Sputnik vaccine,”hetweetedon Tuesday, commenting on a Hungary’s receiving the modest shipment of the Russian inoculation for trials earlier this week. Roth has run the George-Soros funded institution for 27 years, and his Twitter feed suggests his views strongly align with the concerns of his Hungarian-born sponsor. Hungary is one of about 50 countries that have expressed interest in the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine. Some of them, including Argentina, Venezuela and Belarus, have already received first batches of the drug. Roth opposing the Russian jab to the“proven”versions adopted by the EU has drawn condemnation from The Grayzone editor Max Blumenthal, who accused the long-time HRW executive of running“a disinfo campaign”against the Russian vaccine, that has shown roughly the same efficacy as its western counterparts. “The vaccines produced by Western Big Pharma are no more “proven” than the Sputnik V. Both demonstrate 90%+ efficacy levels in trials,”he noted. The vaccines produced by Western Big Pharma are no more “proven” than the Sputnik V. Both demonstrate 90%+ efficacy levels in trials. But it was only a matter of time before NATO hand puppets ran a disinfo campaign against the Russian vaccine.https://t.co/ZF7G6cEV9Z Mark Ames, the host of the popular War Nerd podcast, accused Roth of“openly subverting trust in Russia’s Covid vaccine.” One day NATO toadies are scaring us about alleged sneaky Russian disinfo campaigns to subvert trust in western Covid vaccines...next day NATO toadies are openly subverting trust in Russia’s Covid vaccine, and not ashamed either. Bravo, sir!https://t.co/VZn2TB6Lhx Other commentators echoed the sentiment, some jokingly appointing Roth a spokesman for rival Moderna and Pfizer jabs. And why Kenneth are the western vaccines better than the Russian ones? What is the evidence other than Cold War style propaganda? Are you a spokesperson for Moderna or Pfizer? So in your eyes this is what´s all about? ""Score political points?"" Oh, how dare Hungary buy a minimal stock of 6,000 vaccines from Russia, right? 🤦😂 Some next level propaganda by Kenneth Roth. In a Facebookposton Tuesday, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto defended the move to purchase the vaccine, noting that Russian health authorities provided Hungarian doctors and epidemiologists full access to laboratories where the jab is being manufactured, and that the members of the delegation were more satisfied with the tour, speaking about the“state of the art technology”and“the highest level of expertise”by the Russian researchers upon return. Szijjarto lamented, however, that the opinion of the medical professionals did not placate the nay-sayers, seeking to politicize the issue. “This is an extremely irresponsible thing,”the minister said, pointing out that Hungary has for decades been taking advantage of Russia-made inoculations. “The vast majority of Hungarians have been vaccinated with Russian vaccines since childhood, as all our vaccines used to come from there,”he said. As an EU member, Hungary has to wait for a medicine to be greenlit by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), responsible for approving new drugs and vaccines across the bloc before it can put it to use. The Amsterdam-based body has so far given its seal of approval only to one vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The watchdog is set to review the US-based Moderna vaccine’s application by January 6, instead of the initial 12 January deadline, after it faced accusations of dragging its feet on the urgent issue. At the same time, EMA’s executive director Emer Cooke said that if countries believe that“the benefits”of a certain vaccine, not approved by the EU, outweigh the risks then they are“free to allow the temporary use of a product without a license.” Think your friends would be interested?

"15 Dec, 2020","Los Angeles' new Soros-funded prosecutor pushes for easier punishment over brutal double murder of Russian snowboarder, policeman","LA district attorney George Gascon, elected last month with funding from George Soros, is reportedly revising sentencing to ensure the alleged killer of a Russian snowboarder and a sheriff's deputy may get out of prison someday. The new Los Angeles County district attorney, who had already ruled out the death penalty when he took office last week, will ban prosecutors in his office from seeking a sentence of life in prison without parole, according to a report byFox 11 Los Angeles. Life without parole was previously sought in cases involving special circumstances and punishment enhancements, such as suspects who are convicted of murdering multiple people. One high-profile beneficiary of the rule change is Rhett Nelson, who stands accused of murdering Russian snowboarding medalist Dmitry Koltsov after a verbal altercation in June 2019. About an hour after shooting the 31-year-old Koltsov and leaving him to die on the sidewalk, Nelson allegedly shot Deputy Sheriff Joseph Gilbert Solano in the back of the head while Solano was waiting in the drive-thru lane at an Alhambra fast-food restaurant. In addition to the two murders, Nelson allegedly robbed a filling station and may have been involved in five additional robberies that same day. Koltsov, a member of Russia's national snowboarding team, won a silver medal in the Swiss Open Halfpipe Championship in 2012 and a bronze in the Russian Halfpipe Cup Final that same year. He also took bronze in the big-air discipline at the Russian championship in 2010. ""I don't want to believe this loss,""seven-time Russian snowboarding championAlyona Alekhinatold Zvezda TV.""It's impossible to realize and accept – a monstrous accident. Anyone could have been in his place."" At the time, it was reported that Nelson could face the death penalty. The murdered deputy's sister, Christina Solano, was shocked by Gascon's decision to give Nelson a chance at parole someday, if he's convicted. ""We are the victims here, my brother is a victim, not this person that shot him,""Solano told Fox 11.""I don't understand what his purpose is to let these murderers out of jail. I don't get it . . . . He's like the devil."" She added that Gascon decided to reduce the potential sentence for Nelson without consulting her, saying ""It's disgusting, and he's disgusting."" Deputy Solano’s sister tells me re: Gascon:“He’s like the devil, I don’t understand it. He should be there for the families. We are the victims here, my brother is a victim, not this person that shot him! It’s disgusting, and he’s disgusting. Full, emotional intvw 10pm@FOXLApic.twitter.com/AwZslV3gD5 A spokesman for Gascon's office told Fox 11 that California's parole board could release Nelson decades from now if members determine that he's been rehabilitated. Such a decision would reflect the criminal justice system and the public deciding that Nelson no longer poses a threat to society and it's not beneficial to keep him in prison at taxpayer cost. The sentencing revision is just the latest in aseries of changessince Gascon took over the nation's largest district attorney's office last week. Besides banning the death penalty, he stopped use of cash bail in most cases to avoid ""unnecessary incarceration"" while suspects are awaiting trial. He also directed prosecutors to help convicted criminals who were sentenced too harshly in the past to win reductions to their prison terms – even as the county grapples with surging crime. Gascon's campaign received more than $2.5 million in funding fromSoros, the Hungarian-born billionaire who has helped install left-leaning DAs across the US. He was also backed by Black Lives Matter, helping him to defeat the first black district attorney in Los Angeles County's history. Gascon, 65, was born in Cuba and spent more than 20 years on the Los Angeles police force. As district attorney in San Francisco from 2011 to 2019, he presided over surges in property crime and drug addiction, well as violent crime that was 82 percent higher than the national average.

"12 Dec, 2020","Western media condemns Soros & US-government backed American NGO chief’s expulsion from Russia, but ignores lobby group’s funding","Western journalists, rights groups and governments are concerned about the head of a foreign NGO being asked to leave Russia. However, serious discussion of the organization’s background, and funding sources, is completely absent. Last week, it was announced that Moscow had revoked the residency of Vanessa Kogan, a US national who heads the NGO Stichting Justice Initiative (SJI) in Russia. If her appeal against the decision isn’t successful, she’ll be forced to leave the country, where she has lived for over a decade, and has two children who are Russian nationals. Authorities had been mounting pressure on the organization for some time — one of its branches was deemed a foreign agent in 2019, and the group’s offices in Dagestan, Moscow, and Ingushetia have been raided by officials in recent months. Condemnation from Western media and rights groups was immediate, with the issue framed as just the latest example of an ongoing autocratic crackdown on rights activists in Russia. The censures were intriguing for what they both did and didn’t say. Perhaps predictably, references to its almost entirely foreign-borne history, composition, finances — which includes support from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation (OSF) — and ties to dubious Washington-based regime change entities were entirely absent. Mainstream outlets such as the UK’s Guardian newspaper universally referred to Kogan and SJI as“prominent”and/or“well-known”, a somewhat peculiar characterizations given neither she nor the organization received virtually any media attention whatsoever in its nigh-on 20 years of operation, prior to her residency being revoked. Perhaps she and SJI are only familiar to the small community of Western journalists and activists in the Russian capital. In any event, several genuinely high-profile organizations and figures, such as Peter Stano, European Commission lead spokesperson for external affairs, slammed Kogan’s expulsion on Twitter - SJI’s own account on the social network is largely dormant, having accrued just 231 followers in its four-and-half years on the platform. Conversely, the numerous mainstream articles on the move made virtually no reference to the organization’s funding sources — The Guardian perhaps went furthest, at least hinting SJI receives financial support“from abroad”. A joint statement signed by six NGOs was similarly opaque on the former question, merely noting SJI was“one of the most active in Russia in bringing cases”to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and had secured over 250 judgements in favor of complainants. Curiously, there was no mention of the intimate ties between SJI and two of the cosignatories, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, an oversight one might think unethical. The sextet moreover alleged SJI“has always been open and transparent about its work”, a claim difficult to square with the paucity of information on its official website. A section on the organization’s finances sparingly notes it“raises funds from institutional and government donors”. Financial statements are provided, but only from 2010 - 2017, and aren’t at all informative, merely noting SJI’s yearly income, and what it was spent on. Still, they indicate the vast bulk of its budget is goes on salaries, and grants have accounted for up to 99 percent of the organization’s yearly funding. The organization’s annual reports are somewhat more illuminating, although they’re only available from 2006 - 2011, and the final instalment isn’t even publicly listed. They reveal SJI has at least previously been funded by a number of controversial Western ‘philanthropic’ organizations, including Soros’ aforementioned OSF. This vehicle, which bankrolls civil society groups the world over to the tune of many millions, has been embroiled in countless controversies since its establishment in 1993. Mounting suspicion of OSF internationally may at least partially explain why SJI has become ever-increasingly unwilling to divulge who and what is bankrolling it over time. Recent years have seen numerous governments investigate and curtail the foundation’s activities, if not outright ban it from operating on their soil - among them Russia, after Moscow ruled the organization represented a threat to national security in November 2015. SJI’s fiscal opacity is assisted by being based in the Netherlands - as its name implies, it’s a ‘Stichting’, or foundation. While not registered as a charity, it’s characterised as being“without commercial enterprise”, so isn’t required to file accounts under Dutch law. ‘Stichtings’ are openly advertised as ideal ways for wealthy individuals and corporations to minimize tax liabilities and discretely distribute funds internationally. The organization’s 2011 annual report reveals SJI was established in 2001 by a trio of Dutchmen, Diederik Lohman, the director of Human Rights Watch’s health division, Jan ter Laak, a theologian, and Egbert Wesselink, a senior advisor at PAX, a Netherlands-based NGO. Further underlining SJI’s foreign nature, its governing board boasts only one Russian member, Alexandra Koulaeva. Previously an activist with Moscow-based civil rights group Memorial, she has since relocated to Paris to work for the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). FIDH likewise receives OSF funding, along with financial support from the European Union, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and a variety of Western governments. Wesselink also sits on the board — PAX has the same correspondence address as SJI, a post office box in Utrecht, and also gets OSF funding. The rest of the board is comprised of Ole Solvang, of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Tanya Mazur, director of Amnesty International Ukraine, and Viviana Krstecevic, of the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL). The Council is bankrolled by numerous European states, while CEJIL has a variety of international donors, among them OSF, and the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The connection between NED and SJI is supremely striking for more reasons than one. Firstly, NED was banned in Russia July 2015 on the same grounds as OSF — the move was widely lambasted at the time, but any consideration of the organization’s shadowy history and activities, and the role they played in motivating Moscow’s decision, was conspicuously missing. NED was founded in November 1983 - then-Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey and senior CIA covert operations specialist Walter Raymond Jr. were instrumental in its creation. They sought to construct a mechanism to support groups inside foreign countries that would engage in propaganda and political action the CIA had historically organized and paid for in secret. In 1991, senior NED official Allen Weinstein acknowledged“a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA”. The specifics of CEJIL’s activities on behalf of NED, for which it has reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars over decades, may be relevant to assessing SJI’s own work. In September 2003, the organization granted CEJIL US$83,000 to train citizens in launching legal action against Caracas via the Inter-American Commission and Inter-American Court of Human Rights, a little-known yet extremely powerful Washington and Costa Rica-based legal nexus that claims jurisdiction over the entirety of the Americas, with the agreement of the Organization of American States. The grant led to a dramatic increase in frivolous claims brought against the Venezuelan government by opposition activists, all of which circumvented the country’s legal system and undermined its sovereignty, granting power of judgment to a potentially sympathetic foreign body. SJI board member Viviana Krsticevic’s official biography on CEJIL’s website notes she has litigated cases before both the Inter-American Commission and Inter-American Court of Human Rights, strongly suggesting she was involved in these very NED-funded anti-Chavez efforts. SJI says its purpose is to provide legal support to residents of the North Caucasus who seek justice for alleged human rights abuses through international bodies such as the ECHR. When Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991, the region became a haven for criminals, kidnappers, and Islamist warlords, and over the course of two extremely brutal wars, December 1994 – August 1996, August 1999 - May 2000), enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, torture and unfair trial became routine. Such crimes continue intermittently to this day, and few would surely argue with the moral necessity of bringing those responsible to justice and securing redress for those affected. Nonetheless, the risk of at least some cases being without foundation and/or politically motivated is significant, a prospect demonstrably magnified when there is a financial incentive for individuals to bring cases, and organizations specifically seek out individuals to represent in such legal actions. For example, in February 2017 award winning British lawyer Phil Shiner, who’d played a leading role in bringing legal action against British troops for their maltreatment of Iraqis following the 2003 invasion, was struck off the solicitors’ register. It had been revealed he paid middlemen to seek out claimants, and made“unsolicited direct approaches”to potential clients. Could SJI have helped facilitate potentially vexatious claims against Russia in the ECHR? Krsticevic’s position on the organization’s board suggests this is a possibility, and the organization’s 2010 annual report makes clear the organization specifically sought out young Russian lawyers and trained them to bring cases to the Court, and boasts of how financial rewards paid to out its claimants had almost doubled over the past decade, to an average of €60,000 - 70,000. At the very least, the same document makes clear“forcing structural change in Russian law and policy”was a key objective of its founders from the beginning. As such, SJI is just one example of how Western powers quietly and surreptitiously influence politics and policy in“enemy”states via NGOs, under the aegis of democracy and human rights promotion. While the aims of the foreign funded organizations in question may be benign, the goals of those bankrolling them are often far from benevolent, and all too frequently left unexamined.

"3 Dec, 2020",Moscow moves to expel Soros-linked US activist as ex-president Medvedev warns foreign NGOs trying to sow discord in Russia,"The Russian government is set to expel a prominent human-rights activist, with former president Dmitry Medvedev claiming there’s a co-ordinated campaign by international organizations to stoke unrest in the world’s largest state. Vanessa Kogan, the director of the Stichting Justice Initiative project, told Britain’s Guardian newspaper that Russian authorities had notified her of the revocation of her residency permit. She will now have two weeks to leave the country, where she has lived for more than ten years. She also has two children with a Russian national. The Stichting Justice Initiative is an NGO which, it says, provides legal support to Russians in cases of perceived human rights abuses. It has been less open about its funding in recent years, but in 2010 and 2011, it was bankrolled by the Dutch government and the Hungarian billionaire George Soros. via his ‘Open Society’ pressure group, which has been banned in Russia and declared“undesirable.” Kogan's work has previously focused on the North Caucasus region, where her group has represented people alleging victimization at the hands of authorities. Its activity in the majority Muslim area has reportedly brought tensions with local leaders, such as Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Republic of Chechnya. Now the Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council, Medvedev, who has also served as Russia’s prime minister, told reporters on Thursday that well-funded foreign groups were using networks in Russia to“exacerbate the internal political situation in certain regions, including through Russian non-profit groups they associate with.” He went on to add that these NGOs“depend on internet media, and use various far-fetched reasons for rewriting the events of our national history.”He called this a“large-scale information campaign, being conducted to discredit the leadership of some specific territories and Federal Subjects.” In November, the country’s State Duma debated new legislation that would expand the definition of foreign agents, enabling the label to be applied not only to NGOs and media organizations, but also to ordinary citizensIn 2018, the United States imprisoned a Russian citizen, Maria Butina, claiming that she was a foreign agent operating on behalf of Moscow. Authorities allege that she had infiltrated conservative-leaning organizations to promote better ties between Washington and the Kremlin. She served five months in prison, some of it in solitary confinement, before being deported back to Russia. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"13 Oct, 2020",State Department demands US think tanks disclose foreign funding because of ‘China and Russia’,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leveraging the fear of Russia and China to demand funding transparency from think tanks the State Department works with, while omitting the actual, documented sources of influence dollars. Citing the need to“protect the integrity of civil society institutions,”Pompeo announced on Tuesday that think tanks and other organizations that“wish to engage”with the State Department need to“disclose prominently on their websites funding they receive from foreign governments, including state-owned or state-operated subsidiary entities.”  To protect the integrity of our relationships with think tanks and related institutions we're taking a simple step to encourage transparency: think tanks that wish to engage with the@StateDeptshould disclose funding they receive from foreign governments.https://t.co/TRdy7cvMMM While Foggy Bottom welcomed the“diverse”outside expertise to better advance US interests, Pompeo said he was“mindful”that“some foreign governments, such as those of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation”seek to influence US foreign policy through“lobbyists, external experts, and think tanks.” The new policy is distinct from existing requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and while it doesn’t bar engagement with entities that refuse disclosure, strictly speaking, State Department staff are told to be“mindful”of it when deciding“whether and how”to work with them.  Pompeo has been one of the more outspoken Trump administration officials on the subject of China, arguingin Julythat Beijing is a threat to“our people and our prosperity”and that the“free world”has to“change communist China”or be changed by it, going forward. Last year, he tried toexpand the missionof NATO to the“current and potential long-term threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.” The State Department has likewise leveraged the baseless accusations of“collusion”leveled at the Trump administration by the media and Democrats to harden the US policy towards Moscow. Focusing on Beijing and Moscow in Tuesday’s announcement was“pretty hollow,”according to Sarah Margon from the foreign policy arm of George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, as it did not mention the well-documented funding of US think tanks and lobbyists coming from places such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  Going after China & Russia for their US think tanks support & retention of US lobbyists is pretty hollow when you omit so many other major players that do the same, incl UAE, Saudi, Qatar, Israel & Egypt (to name just a few other govts).https://t.co/sxNGbzy7u7 Indeed, a 30-pagereportcompiled by the Center for International Policy and published in February lists a number of countries funding US think tanks. China is mentioned in three instances, while the UK, Qatar and the UAE feature prominently. Russia is not on the list at all. We tracked more than $174 million in foreign funding going to the nation's top think tanks in our new report ""Foreign Funding of Think Tanks in America.""

"15 Sep, 2020",Caitlin Johnstone: Democrats ignore US military’s refutation of ‘Russian bounties’ story,"The US military has been unable to find any evidence that Russia paid bounties on US troops to Taliban militants, confirming what was obvious to anyone who hasn’t had their brain stem hijacked by mass media-induced Russophobia. ByCaitlin Johnstone, an independent journalist based in Melbourne, Australia. Her website ishereand you can follow her on Twitter@caitoz NBC Newsreportsthe following: Two months after top Pentagon officials vowed to get to the bottom of whether the Russian government bribed the Taliban to kill American service members, the commander of troops in the region says a detailed review of all available intelligence has not been able to corroborate the existence of such a program. “It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,” Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, told NBC News. McKenzie oversees U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. continues to hunt for new information on the matter, he said. “We continue to look for that evidence,” the general said. “I just haven’t seen it yet. But … it’s not a closed issue.” McKenzie’s comments, reflecting a consensus view among military leaders, underscores the lack of certainty around a narrative that has been accepted as fact by Democrats and other Trump critics, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, who has cited Russian bounties in attacks on President Donald Trump. 2 months after top Pentagon officials vowed to get to the bottom of whether the Russian gov't bribed Taliban to kill US service members, the commander in the region says a review of the intel has not been able to corroborate the existence of such a programhttps://t.co/RaiUV2XtHr Like many other critical voices, Isaidfrom the beginning that there was no reason to believe the Russian bounties narrative and that the mass publication of baseless and nonsensical claims circulated anonymously by US intelligence operativesconstitutesjournalistic malpractice. There is no excuse for a reporter to ever present anonymous CIA press releases under the guise of news, especially when they make no sense; the US-centralized coalition in Afghanistan is a hostile occupying force and there is an essentially limitless number of people there who require no financial incentive to attack them. But this is exactly what happened. Once the news media had reported the unsubstantiated rumor given to them by anonymous spies, spinmeisters like Rachel Maddow beganpresentingit as an objective fact that had been fully authenticated, and from there the entire Democratic political/media class began months of loudly babbling about how suspicious it is that the US president hadn’t confronted Vladimir Putin and sanctioned Russia in response to this verified fact. And it was never anything of the sort. It was fake. But now aggressions have been ramped up against Russia, Trump has been painted as a Putin puppet who hates the troops, Senate Democrats haveintroduceda bill mandating sanctions on any Russians involved in this imaginary conspiracy, and legislation has beenpassedmaking it harder for Trump to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. The story did its job, and now that it’s proven false the same people who promoted it are uniformly ignoring the new evidence which clearly shows it to have been bogus. NYT ""Russian bounties"" report dropped on June 26. Do you think any of those who spent the summer screaming about Russian bounties will comment on, or even acknowledge, the top commander of US forces in Afghanistan saying that, after a lengthy investigation, there's no evidence?pic.twitter.com/0MfuwGEtm7 This story has been so ubiquitously promoted within the establishment liberal echo chamber that it’s impossible to list all the dishonest portrayals it’s been given since June, but to pick just a few recent examples: Again, that’s just a very few very recent examples. Now that their claims have proven false, how many of these highly influential people do you think are using their massive platforms to spread awareness of this fact? Take a wild guess. If you said zero, you are correct. In fact Democratic Party influencers are even continuing to promote the debunked Russian bounties story many hours after the report debunking it became available on mainstream platforms. Andrew Bates, Director of Rapid Response for the Biden campaign, justtweetedthat“Trump is giving Russia a pass for putting bounties on the heads of American service members.” At a time when Trump is giving Russia a pass for putting bounties on the heads of American service members.Team Trump needs so much reminding: this is A-M-E-R-I-C-A.""Trump ad asks people to support the troops. But it uses a picture of Russian jets""https://t.co/7CxCWBfXp7 Again, this is hours after it’s been public knowledge that this is a completely false thing to assert. And we can absolutely expect this to continue. We can absolutely expect establishment Democrats to continue bleating about Russian bounties in Afghanistan for as long as it is politically convenient to do so. Theyneverlet the lack of evidence for their position get in the way before, and they won’t let it get in the way now. The arguments that they make for their power-serving position are not designed to reflect truth or reality, they are designed to serve power. That’s exactly what echo chambers are for. An email published byWikiLeaksin 2016 was sent by Democratic Party insider John Podesta to billionaires George Soros, Peter Lewis, John Sperling, and Herb and Marion Sandler in 2007 with a detailed and structured overview of material the group had covered during a meeting they’d had in September (to read the email click ‘Attachments’ and then ‘2008 Combined Fundraising, Message and Mobilization Plan’). Among the things these powerful manipulators discussed was the creation of a“robust echo chamber”to be used in the party’s interests. On page two of the attachment: “Control the political discourse.So much effort over the past few years has been focused on better coordinating, strengthening, and developing progressive institutions and leaders. Now that this enhanced infrastructure is in place — grassroots organizing; multi-issue advocacy groups; think tanks; youth outreach; faith communities; micro-targeting outfits; the netroots and blogosphere — we need to better utilize these networks to drive the content of politics through a strong “echo chamber” and message delivery system.” And on page four: “Create a robust echo chamber with progressive messaging that spans from the opposition campaigns to outside groups, academic experts, and bloggers.” Usually when you see the names Podesta and Soros presented together it just means you stumbled into a bad corner of the internet pervaded by sloppy thinking and an irrational trust in anonymous 8chan posts, but in this WikiLeaks email we actually get a useful glimpse into the reason people can keep babbling about something that’s completely divorced from the truth without being smashed by cognitive dissonance. The fact that echo chambers are actively created by establishment manipulators enables establishment-friendly narratives to remain afloat long after evidence should have sunk them. Read the comments from liberals on this tweet from July. They were all 100% certain there was proof that Russia had paid bounties on US troops to Taliban-linked fighters, because people like@Maddowtold them so. Now the top US commander in Afghanistan says there's no evidence.https://t.co/IJNDq1PPyK Several weeks ago Itweeted“It’s clear that ‘Russia paid bounties to Taliban fighters’ is one of those narratives the propagandists decided to ram into mainstream consciousness until they force it to become consensus orthodoxy by repetition and sheer force of will, with zero interest in facts or evidence.” This has indeed happened, and it will continue to happen. The oligarchs who rule over us have so thoroughly divorced the information ecosystem from truth that they can get people to believe just about anything. They do this because they understand that humans are storytelling animals and you control the humans by controlling the stories. We will be unable to fight lies with truth until we collectively understand this fact as well as our oppressors. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"10 Sep, 2020","French pundit queries Western narrative on Navalny ‘poisoning’ & Belarus unrest with ‘CIA’ comments, gets bashed by establishment","A French pundit has questioned the Western narrative that Moscow played a role in the alleged poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny. Yet, the ‘deviation’ did not go down well with some of the French establishment. German military scientists claim that Navalny, a prominent activist in Russia, was poisoned by a potent military-grade nerve agent last month. Berlin said that it had“a lot of evidence”that the Russian state was involved but has so farfailedto provide this evidence to Moscow. Nevertheless, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has threatened Russia with sanctions over the alleged attack, while his G7 colleagues havecondemnedthe“confirmed poisoning”in the“strongest terms.” However, prominent French essayist Eric Zemmour sees things differently. Though Western media are coalescing around the idea that Navalny was poisoned by the Russian state, Zemmour departed from that narrative in dramatic style. “I’m trying to understand, and there are things that confuse me,”he told France's Cnews channel on Wednesday night.“If Putin gave the order to poison this political opponent, then why did Russian doctors save his life and transport him to Germany for treatment by the Germans, at the risk of exposing the crime? This is strange.” Zemmour even hinted that the US Central Intelligence Agency may have had a hand in the case. Some people fantasize about the KGB, which has become the FSB, I fantasize about the CIA, which is still the CIA. The CIA certainly has a long and storied history of assassination attempts on its enemies, and carried out botched poisonings on Cuban leaderFidel Castroand Congolese nationalistPatrice Lumumbaduring the Cold War. Though there is no evidence to suggest it is, Zemmour reckons the agency could be up to its old tricks again. “This story took place at a time when the Americans are putting pressure on the Germans to give up Nord Stream 2,”he remarked, referring to a natural gas pipeline that will supply Germany with cheap Russian gas once operational. The US is opposing the $10 billion project, while trying to boost its own liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe. However, the higher transit costs of the American gas have thus far proven a sticking point for Germany and other EU nations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel initiallysaidthat Navalny’s case would not deter her from pressing ahead with Nord Stream 2, yet the sentiment in Berlin appears to be changing. After dozens of EU MEPs circulated a letter calling for a halt to the project, Maas said this week that he hopes“the Russians don’t force us to change our stance on Nord Stream 2.”Despite this statement, Maas admitted that he has not yet passed the information relevant to the case to Moscow. While being rather vague on Washington's potential - and not proven - involvement in Navalny saga, Zemmour appeared to be rather sure on US role in the current unrest in Belarus. Opposition leaders there say President Alexander Lukashenko’s recent re-election was fraudulent. ""As for Belarus, I can clearly see the CIA behind what is happening, because this is what they have been doing for ten years,”Zemmour said.“Whenever there is an 'Orange Revolution', Americans, Soros NGOs and American special services are behind it as if by accident.” Lukashenko himself would certainly agree, and has accused Washington and its allies of attempting to kickstart a Ukraine-style“color revolution”to oust him from power. France’s establishment, on the other hand, was mortified by Zemmour’s claims. “I thought I was on Russia Today,”Nathalie Loiseau, an MEP from French President Emmanuel Macron’s party, exclaimed, shocked that opinions like Zemmour’s could be expressed on French television. In deviating from the establishment narrative, Loiseau accused Zemmour of speaking for“the Russian far-right.” French parliamentarian Frederic Petit said that he was“flabbergasted to hear Eric Zemmour on a French channel pouring the same propaganda (conspiracy) served by the Lukashenko regime and Russia.” J’ai cru que j’étais sur Russia Today.

"24 Aug, 2020","RT is accused of supporting QAnon. But with Russiagate back for 2020, who are the real state-funded conspiracy theorists?","Certain mainstream media are losing sleep over what they claim is Russian support for pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon. But it’s their own obsession that spawned RT’s coverage – and their own behavior that encourages such groups. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 According to Reuters, RT’s coverage of social media platforms’ crackdown on QAnon is proof that Russia actually supports the fringe movement, which believes President Donald Trump and a crew of “white hats” within his administration are going to save the US from a cabal of satanic pedophiles any moment now, swooping in to arrest everyone from failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to liberal billionaire George Soros in one great blast of swamp-draining. Lacking any proof to back this hypothesis – indeed, the writer admits RT’s coverage has not only “fallen short of full-throated support,” but is even “critical” of the rightwing psy-op – the outlet instead defers to disinformation ‘experts’ Graphika, who note that the Internet Research Agency – the “Russian trolls” still blamed in some corners for delivering the 2016 election to Trump – tagged a bunch of tweets with QAnon slogans in 2019. This less-than-compelling ‘proof’ ignores the deluge of QAnon-related stories US media have churned out in recent weeks depicting the movement as nothing short of an apocalyptic threat to the American way of life. Dozens of articles with headlines like ‘QAnon is running amok, and the time has comefor interventions’ and ‘QAnon is conspiratorial, dangerous,and growing’ have flooded the internet, urging social media platforms to suppress it. Why hasn’t Reuters accused these outlets of promoting QAnon? RT’s crime, it seems, was observing that the group “channel[s] legitimate outrage.” Apparently, commenting on the sociopolitical chasms dividing American society is verboten – at least, for media outlets Washington doesn’t like. US and friendly foreign media areallowedto do itas muchas theyplease, but from anyone else, it counts as “sowing division.” For all its internal struggles, Washington seems to think its citizens should put on a happy face and present a unified front to the world – an absurdity that would be funny if Americans weren’t genuinely suffering under an incompetent government that would rather hand their tax dollars toprivate equity vultures,Israel, and thePentagonthan ensure they have food on the table. Russian media didn’t create the widespread distrust in the American media establishment that fuels conspiracy theories like QAnon, whose adherents proudly share Trump’s disdain for the “fake news” churned out by the likes of CNN. They did – and continue to do – that themselves, by writing off legitimate dissent as foreign meddling and gaslighting Americans to within an inch of their lives. (Think you saw protesters in Portland burning Bibles? Who are you going to believe, theNew York Timesor your lying eyes?) It’s not hard to see where this “Russia is promoting QAnon!” narrative is going, either. Just last week, the narrative managers at the Times werelamentingthat while Facebook and Twitter have robust systems in place to suppress foreign media during election season, they don’t have an easy fix for domestic propaganda like QAnon. Linking the sprawling network of conspiratorial content to the Kremlin solves that problem. But there’s more than a little irony in who Reuters has chosen to slay the dragon of disinformation. Graphika, a “social network analysis” firm thatappears to specializein squashing narratives that contradict the US government line, counts among its ranks such luminaries as Ben Nimmo, perhaps best known for baselessly accusing British and Finnish citizens ofbeing Russian bots. Nimmo, who remains a senior non-resident fellow at pro-war NATO-backed think tank Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and has also worked with the UK government’s secretive Integrity Initiative, was hired by Graphika last year as its Head of Investigations, suggesting the company values a vivid imagination over factual accuracy. Like the Atlantic Council itself, Graphika has partnered extensively with the same US government agencies that continue to flog the “Russian meddling won Trump the 2016 election” conspiracy theory. Rather than die a graceful death after the Mueller report failed to turn up the promised evidence of collusion in 2019, Russiagate has been resurrected for the 2020 election with a 1,000-page Senate report and a parade of ominous government statements suggestingnefarious foreign actorsare to blame for any and all election results. Topping off this conspiracy souffle are the usualanonymously-sourced news articlesreminding Americans to blame Putin if they don’t get their way in November.

"16 Aug, 2020",Republican congressman goes to CNN to urge Trump to denounce QAnon after pro-conspiracy candidate sweeps Georgia primary,"GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called on President Donald Trump to debunk the QAnon conspiracy, saying that it has gone “mainstream” after a theory-backing Republican candidate all but secured a seat in congress after a primary win. Kinzinger, who has locked horns with Trump in the past, came out swinging against the conspiracy theory during an episode of CNN’s Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter on Sunday. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger speaks out against QAnon and disinformation. “If you believe in this conspiracy theory stuff, especially QAnon, do some independent research. There’s a of stuff debunking it.”pic.twitter.com/GdcZgXJT5F Before his appearance on Trump’s least-favoured channel (well,maybe after Fox News), Kinzinger posted a YouTubevideo, talking about why people fall for conspiracy theories like the fake Moon landing theory and QAnon, which originally sprang up at the 4-chan website in October 2017. The theory is based on online postings or “Q-drops” from an alleged government insider known only as “Q,”  who casts himself as a “patriot.” The theory alleges that there exist child sex trafficking rings among the powerful, as well as Satan-worship and occultism. Some QAnon devotees believe that deep state actors are trying to undermine the Trump administration. Speaking to Stelter, who called the four-minute YouTube clip“outstanding,”Kinzinger said that he believes that top Republicans, who have generally kept mum about the theory, should speak up against it since it has gone“mainstream.” I think up to maybe about a week ago there wasn’t a reason to denounce it because it didn't need the attention, but now that it's made mainstream, we have a candidate that embraces it that won a primary Kinzinger referred to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who prevailed over fellow Republican John Cowan this week to win the Georgia primary, and with that, most likely a Congress seat, given that her district is a deeply red one. Greene has come under fire from both left and right for her support of the QAnon theory, as well as her harsh criticism of Democratic mega-donor George Soros. However, that did not stop her slide to a primary victory, gaining over 57 percent of the vote. Arguing that Republicans should distance themselves from the theory, Kinzinger took a thinly-veiled swipe at Trump, saying:“The president hasn't fully denounced it or denounced it at all,”adding that“now it's time”for leaders to come out against it. Ironically, when going after one conspiracy, Kinzinger has added fire to another, saying that while it’s not clear who was behind the theory, it might as well be… Russia. “We don’t necessarily know where it comes from...if it’s just one person, if it’s a basement dweller or [if] that’s started as a joke, if it’s multiple people now, if it’s Russian intelligence even,""he said in the YouTube video. Trump congratulated Greene shortly after her resounding primary victory, however, he has brushed off questions about her QAnon beliefs so far. Think your friends would be interested?

"6 Aug, 2020",Takes one to know one? New ‘Russian disinformation’ scare-sheet by State Department’s propaganda arm is full of projection,"The State Department has released a report purporting to unmask “Russia’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem,” highlighting supposed Russian proxies in an effort to cast all opposition to US policy as Kremlin-linked. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 Behind every narrative unfriendly to US geopolitical aims is a Russian proxy typing madly away, according to the Global Engagement Center (GEC), the State Department’s “counter-propaganda” vehicle, which released a report to that effect on Wednesday titled“Pillars of Russia’s Disinformation and Propaganda Ecosystem.” More than half of the 76-page paper consists of“proxy site profiles”– writeups of websites deemed to be secretly (or not-so-secretly) operated by the Kremlin. While some are openly connected to the Russian government (New Eastern Outlook, an official publication of the Russian Academy of Sciences), others – like Montreal-based Global Research – are not. In the eyes of the GEC, however, all“serve no other purpose but to push pro-Kremlin content”(which might be news to the websites’ operators). Most have previously appeared on lists of “Russian propaganda websites” such as the sprawling blacklist published by PropOrNot – ashady outfitlinked to pro-war think tank, the Atlantic Council – in November 2016. While the report is supposedly dedicated to“exposing Russia’s tactics so that partner and allied governments, civil society organizations, academia, the press, and the international public”can arm themselves against evil Kremlin propaganda, its focus on specific websites, their social media follower counts, and the amount of traffic they get seems tailor-made for legitimizing government censorship. Any ideas which resemble the content of these particular websites are to be squashed, sidelined, and suppressed, as are any other sites who publish writers associated with the “proxy sites.” The“ecosystem”metaphor is deployed to explain why some alleged Russian proxies occasionally come out with material opposing the Russian government line – they’re just“muddying the waters of the information environment in order to confuse those trying to discern the truth.” As for“truth,”the report has an interesting interpretation of the concept. The claims that it deems to constitute“disinformation”include the assertion that“financial circles and governments are using the coronavirus to achieve [their] own financial and political goals”(are thereanythat aren’t?). They also include claims that“EU bureaucrats and affiliated propaganda bodies are… blaming Russia for the crisis over the outbreak of coronavirus”(who knew theFinancial Timeswas a Kremlin disinfo outlet too?) Also included are claims that“George Soros’ tentacles entangle politics and generate chaos around the world”(if the shoefits…). The GEC report wouldn’t be a Russia scare-sheet if it didn’t include a heavy dose of projection, and this one does not disappoint. The Kremlin’s“weaponization of social media”and“cyber-enabled disinformation”are deemed“part of its approach to using information as a weapon,”while Moscow is accused of“invest[ing] massively in its propaganda channels, its intelligence services and its proxies to conduct malicious cyber activity to support their disinformation efforts.” But the CIA and US military intelligence have been engaging in pre-emptive cyber-warfare for two years with the full knowledge and consent of the executive branch – a legitimization ofcovert activitiesthat previously ran on a don’t-ask-don’t-tell basis dating at least back to the development of the Stuxnet virus that devastated Iran’s nuclear sites over a decade ago. US weaponization of social media is so pervasive the US Army was recentlybooted offstreaming platform Twitch for relentlessly propagandizing teenage users. The Pentagon has beenspreadingpro-US propaganda using hordes of “sock puppets” – fake social media accounts purporting to be real people – for upwards of a decade. Indeed, the report hints at these very operations, praising the “thriving counter-disinformation community” that is “pushing back” against those naughty Russians. With social media platforms jittery over the looming US election in November, the report appears designed to serve as a handy cheat-sheet as to which opinions to censor to avoid a repeat of President Donald Trump’s upset victory in 2016 – even though none of the listed “proxies” could be considered pro-Trump by any stretch of the imagination. It also provides a portable reference for Americans worried about committing thought-crime, though the complete lack of fanfare accompanying its publication – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned it in passing during a press conference on Wednesday – would seem to suggest it is not meant for the hoi polloi.

"4 Aug, 2020","Censorship or fighting disinformation? Russia to use AI to create controversial ‘fake news’ filter, as Facebook efforts stall","Russia plans to create a data service to tackle 'fake news,' the country's media watchdog Rospechat said on Tuesday. US social media giant Facebook has also attempted to construct a similar system but progress has been slow. The automated editor's job description will include “comparing as many news-related facts as possible” and “finding the wrong ones,” Rospechat's deputy chief Ilya Lazarev wrote in a letter to the Ministry of Communications, which was quoted by Moscow business daily RBK on Tuesday. Rospechat expects the counter-misinformation aggregator to be completed by 2023 and hopes to make it available to both organizations and individuals. In order to get the project moving, the watchdog has requested 94.3 million rubles ($1.3 million) from federal authorities. Previously, Human Rights Watch - an American lobby group bankrolled by George Soros - has claimed that the Russian government has been building “an entire arsenal of tools to reign over information, internet users, and communications networks” which could further suffocate independent media in the country. Rospechat's fake news filter is somewhat similar to a tool Facebook has been attempting to create. In 2016, its founder Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to develop a 'misinformation' filter but four years later, there is still no sign of it. Zuckerberg admitted then that the problems were “complex, both technically and philosophically.” Russia has significantly expanded laws and regulations tightening control over internet infrastructure, online content, and the privacy of communications. If carried out to their full restrictive potential, the new measures will severely undermine the ability of people in Russia to exercise their human rights online, including freedom of expression and freedom of access to information.

"26 Jul, 2020","Covid gave our world leaders the chance to be heroic like the ones in disaster films. Instead, they’ve acted like turkeys","When global disasters strike in movies, world leaders often forget political differences to do what’s right for the planet. But the response to Covid-19 has been confused, ineffective and self-interested. Where’s Morgan Freeman? Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Can you imagine Donald Trump or Xi Jinping flying a jet fighter in a dog fight with alien spacecraft? Or Boris Johnson and Vladimir Putin sharing their most valued scientific secrets to save a stranded astronaut? What about Jair Bolsonaro delivering a comfortingspeechto the world where catastrophe has killed billions and the human race will have to ‘reset’ with just a few lucky survivors? You can debate pretty much anything in life but there is one indisputable fact: disaster films are great (prizes for naming the three referenced above). The same ingredients are always present: The disaster (obviously), the heroic and/or rogue scientist(s), the ordinary folk making extraordinary sacrifices. You also need a sprinkling of world leaders making tough decisions and big speeches. Sometimes they get it wrong, sometimes they get it right, and sometimes they are downright heroic. They see a disaster happening and they do whatever it takes to battle it in the interests ofeveryone: see the above examples (Independence Day, The Martian and Deep Impact if you didn’t get them). Sometimes, however, they act like turkeys. Like President Becker inThe Day After Tomorrow, who denies climatic armageddon until most of humanity is extinguished, or President Anheuser in2012who, when the planet is ravaged by earthquakes and tsunamis, wants only elites allowed onto specially-designed ‘arks’. Stupid bastards. And that’s how our world leaders have acted in the face of Covid-19. They’ve shunned the chance to be heroic and resisted ideas such as pooling resources and information, uniting for the common good, lending a hand to the less fortunate, trusting each other – or taking a chance on a well-meaning rogue scientist whomightjust have the key to everything thanks to years of niche research in a tiny Missouri lab. Instead, they’ve resorted to a self-interested blend of blame games, denial, cock-ups, espionage and hogging drugs and wealth. China massively underplayed the seriousness of coronavirus when it first emerged. The USA bought up the world’s supply ofRemdesivir, the first drug to suggest even the slightest effectiveness against the disease. The British government has beenhanding outlucrative Covid-related contracts to its mates. Russia has been accused of trying tospyon vaccine research programmes. Sweden has pretty much ignored the whole thing. The European Union hassquabbledabout how much money its poorer nations can have and how much they have to pay back. There’s been more finger-pointing than inET. And how much have these wealthy states done to help developing nations? Hmm. It’s such a colossal clown show that the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) predicts that poverty and economic inequality will see huge numbers of peoplemigratingfrom their homes in search of food and vaccines. Would Bill Pullman or Morgan Freeman have let that happen? Some members of the public haven’t been all that heroic, either. They’vecoughed in babies’ faces, heldprotestsagainst being asked to wear a mask for a few minutes if they're in a shop,murdered people for doing their jobin trying to protect themselves and others. I don’t remember anyone trying to sabotage Bruce Willis’ massive drill inArmageddonbecause they thought the Earth-bound meteorite was “just a pebble.” I’m sure people will start yelling that the seriousness of coronavirus has been exaggerated, or fabricated by the Deep State to make us wear masks that can be tracked/poisoned by its Soros-funded Lizard paedophile masters. That’s OK, disaster films always feature deniers and conspiracy theorists. But I’d suggest anyone who thinks that Covid-19 isn’t a highly dangerous threat (even if you halve the recorded figures) should learn from the people in Independence Day who had a rooftop party to welcome the aliens. Perhaps I’m being too harsh. Perhaps I’m expecting too much of people conditioned to put their own interests first. Or perhaps this is only the second act and there’s a redemptive narrative arc which sees the US and China collaborate to save the world from the pandemic – and a post-credit scene in which Putin and Johnson express a passionate love for each other. But perhaps I watch too many films. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"27 May, 2020",Moscow has secret Covid-19 CURE for chosen elite: Western media’s favorite Russian pundit voices new conspiracy theory,"As a rule, Western correspondents covering Russia – either by necessity or design – often use extreme or fringe voices to fit their reporting agendas. One of the most frequently cited may have finally jumped the shark this week. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv A handful of Russian ‘experts’ frame the narrative in the US/UK media. The most widely featured include Tatyana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Center (an American think tank funded by George Soros, the US and UK governments, and the EU), Gleb Pavlovsky (a former Vladimir Putin adviser and political strategist, who was dismissed in 2011) and Valery Solovey, once a professor at Moscow’s prestigious MGiMO University. Putting aside Stanovaya (reasonable enough, albeit one-note) and Pavlovsky (so far past his sell-by date that he’s a political museum piece) the continued platform granted to Solovey is incomprehensible. The academic is a David Icke-style conspiracy theorist who makes Alex Jones and Rachel Maddow look like perfectly balanced operators. On Tuesday, he told listeners of liberal radio station Echo of Moscow that the Russian government has a secret drug to cure Covid-19 which is reserved for only a select few. Валерий Соловей в эфире ""Эха"" рассказал, что лекарство от коронавируса уже есть, но его дают не всем. Дали Кадырову и ещё немногим. А вот Мишустину не дали, например.""Вирусолог Соловееей, непростое украшееенье...""pic.twitter.com/RVJkqCMvoW Solovey was speaking about reports on the condition of Ramzan Kadyrov. Some Russian media outlets had suggested that the Chechen leader had been flown to Moscow for treatment after showing symptoms of the virus. “In Moscow they gave him a medicine, there is a very effective drug for the coronavirus, extremely effective, a few people got it already, people who are very close to the Kremlin, and to Mr Putin,”he explained.“By the way, Prime Minister (Mikhail) Mishustin didn’t get this medicine, this drug in 2-3 days healed all symptoms of coronavirus.” In Solovey’s La La Land Basically, Solovey, in all seriousness, was saying that the Kremlin has found a cure for Covid-19, and is keeping it secret from the whole world. Not only that, Putin was apparently willing to take the risk of his own prime minister dying from the disease, and presumably his press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, as well, but decided to save himself, the leader of Chechnya, and a few others. Both Peskov and Mishustin were hospitalized in recent weeks. Not only does Solovey think Putin is some kind of sociopathic remedy hoarder, keeping the elixir for himself while tens of thousands die around the globe and economies are devastated (including Russia’s), he clearly believes the Russian president has no concept of commercial value. Could you only imagine how much money Russia could make from mass producing an antidote to coronavirus right now? Let’s say the Kremlin charged the reasonable sum of $100 a dose, and every advanced country in the world bought up enough to cover half of their populations? That would be $16 billion from the US alone. Plus, another $22 billion from the European Union, with China paying out another $35 billion. At that rate, Putin could save the world, and go on a $100 billion domestic infrastructure splurge, sending his popularity to new heights, both at home and abroad. But no, according to Solovey, Putin would rather spend spring in lockdown at his residence outside Moscow, while unemployment and discontent grows in Russia, and even the May 9 parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Soviet Russia’s World War II victory over Nazi Germany had to be postponed. Not to mention the national vote to change the constitution, back in April. Clearly, Solovey is a crank and a loon. But he has, without question, been among the top few voices most commonly solicited by British and American journalists in Russia in recent years. This, once again, serves to expose the incredibly low standards of Western media in covering the world’s largest country. A diet of mostly agenda-driven feckless hacks citing inept agenda-driven pundits, with readers, unwittingly, consuming an absurd cocktail of drivel. Honest reporting? In February, he warned Russia would invade Belarus, even putting a time scale on it (“within a few days”). This obviously didn’t happen. That came after a crazy prediction last summer that Moscow street protests were set to bring down Putin. These were small events, not even close to the size of similar demonstrations in 2011 and 2012. Earlier last year, he predicted the Russian“system will collapse. [The] Key phase of [the] crisis will last a few days: days that will shock Russia & affect the world.”This was relayed by BBC’s Moscow correspondent to his Twitter followers. Fascinating article in a mainstream Russian paper today, claiming “Putin’s no longer the guarantor of stability”. Political scientist predicts “the system will collapse. Key phase of crisis will last a few days: days that will shock Russia & affect the world.”#ReadingRussiapic.twitter.com/gnEHzNfHl8 Back in 2016, Solovey said Putin was going to quit because he was sick, adding that“the truth”would emerge by December of that year. US/UK media dutifully reported it, with the Daily Mail – Britain’s best-selling newspaper – treating it like fact. Again, we know it wasn’t true. Three years before that, in 2013, Solovey said Putin’s system was“degenerating”and would be“swept away”– just 13 months before the president’s approval ratings went above 80 percent after Moscow’s reabsorption of Crimea. However, the most ludicrous example arguably arrived in 2017 when the Independent’s Moscow correspondent claimed he had a'scoop'“on how Putin nearly quit last year – and why Russia is teetering on acute political crisis.”His main named source was, of course, Valery Solovey. Oliver Carroll told his readers that Russia was“teetering at the edge of an era.” “The last time I felt like this was at the end of the Soviet Union,”he quoted Solovey as saying.“And, worryingly, people who were around at the time are telling me they feel exactly the same.”To make things even more bananas, this atrocious piece of journalism also featured Pavlovsky. Valery Solovey is not a reliable source. He is a conspiracy theorist. Western journalists in Moscow have long known this, but have continued to promote his punditry, to serve their own agendas. After his latest madcap outburst, will they keep quoting him? Or is this the moment the wacky professor finally gets put to the pasture? Of course, they may be hoping that Solovey is proven right and Putin does have a secret Covid-19 cure. For that there are two hopes – Bob Hope and No Hope, and Bob Hope is dead. Like this story?

Thus, its gatekeepers need to ensure the officials who manage the money tree don't realise the emperor has no clothes. ByBryan MacDonald You may remember a report last month from British academics revealing how“claims by the EU's diplomatic servicethat RT is spreading fake news about the coronavirus pandemic were misleading and based on bad methodology.”It came after many mainstream US/UK media outlets uncritically parroted allegations from East StratCom – and its ‘EUvsDisinfo’ information war wing – that“Russian pro-Kremlin media”was conducting a“significant disinformation campaign”to stoke“confusion, panic and fear”in the West and“aggravate the coronavirus pandemic crisis.” READ MORE: No Covid-19 fake news on RT, EU accusations are ‘problematic’ – UK watchdog “The extent of EUvsDisinfo’s misrepresentation of Russian Covid-19 media coverage is troubling,”wrote the report’s authors, Stephen Hutchings and Vera Tolz, professors of Russian Studies at the University of Manchester.

Careless ‘counter-disinformation’ research can become a source for disinformation itself, skewing policy decisions in the EU and the UK /2 They also warned that“careless ‘counter-disinformation’ research can become a source for disinformation itself, skewing policy decisions in the EU and the UK,”before noting that, in terms of Covid-19 coverage, RT’s reporting practices“are undoubtedly superior to East StratCom’s own methods.” East StratCom is part of the EEAS (the EU's diplomatic corps) and is designed to spread Brussels’ message/propaganda in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine – countries Eurocrats have long wanted to pull into their orbit – as well as in Russia itself. Its EUvsDisinfo project is an absurd ‘information wars’ racket, where a large amount of its 3,000 contributors clearly hold strongly negative views of Russia.“Such volunteers, moreover, are operating in a post-Soviet space saturated (for very understandable reasons) by anti-Russian sentiments from which they are unlikely to be completely free,”Hutchings and Tolz noted.“By outsourcing vital research to volunteers working in ideologically fraught environments, EUvsDisinfo will inevitably struggle to present reliable, robust findings.” Its output is mostly ridiculous, essentially attempting to label huge chunks of Russian-language comment or reportage which could be classed as even remotely incorrect as the views of the Russian state. It's as ludicrous as some media monitor in Moscow watching the BBC, ITV and Sky, or listening to LBC and various local radio stations, and jotting down every guest's opinion as representative of London’s official outlook. EUvsDisinfo is awful trash, and I can't emphasise it enough. However, the sad thing is that bureaucrats and politicians who don't have expertise on Russia take it at face value. Which, of course, leads to distrust and helps strain relations. A couple of years ago, the Dutch governmentwantedit shut down, but sadly it still staggers on. The honesty of Tolz and Hutchings – who are in no way pro-Russian – upset a lot of the usual suspects. After all, a lot of people are doing very well out of the ‘disinformation’ industry, and it has brought new vigour, and funding, to the think-tank racket. Predictably, many of them circled like vultures on social media, tearing into the authors. This week Keir Giles, a lobbyist at Chatham House, landed on Reframing Russia’s own site with a blog post (of over 3,300 words) which smacked of something clearly intended to bring them down a peg or two. In 2018/19, Chatham Housetooksix-figure sterling sums from George Soros and oil giants Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, in addition to well over £1.5 million from the British government. And there were also payments from the ubiquitous US National Endowment for Democracy, plus arms makers BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin. In other words, organisations that require hostility with Moscow in order to survive and prosper. None of this is mentioned. A term often wrongly used – and over-used – is‘Orwellian’.However, just this once, let me lean on it, because it fits the bill. Titled‘Defence Against Disinformation is a Team Sport’, Giles' analysis begins by saying that“despite the fact that both groups are notionally on the same side, the incident highlighted a polarisation of opinion on methods to counter disinformation.”But, despite his attempt to play neutral, it's clear which jersey he is wearing. After all, he said on Twitter that Reframing Russia's report was a“deeply flawed hit piece on EUvsDisinfo – so packed with straw men, misconceptions and implicit bias that it completely devalues any genuine findings it contains.” Profoundly disappointing, but no longer surprising, to see@RUSI_orgendorsing this deeply flawed hit piece on@EUvsDisinfo- so packed with straw men, misconceptions and implicit bias that it completely devalues any genuine findings it contains.1/https://t.co/qPnqCuVWiA The intellectual dishonesty of Giles' argument is exposed right from the start when he mentions“activist group GorseFires Collectif,”who he claims are involved in“counter-disinformation activity.”Let's be clear: 'Gorsefires Collectif' is an anonymous Ukraine-focussed Twitter page which stalks, smears and harasses journalists it deems to be insufficiently supportive of Kiev. The nutter(s) running the accountlaunched a bizarre attackon respected Canadian academic Paul Robinson last month that also alleged I was an FSB agent. The same crazy Twitter thread alleged the FSB had changed the spelling of my name in the mid-1990s, when I was at school in Ireland – around 15 years before I first set foot in Russia. That's how preposterous this outfit is, but Giles, who represents a wealthy British state-funded think tank, is citing it as a credible source in an attack on another institution. I'll spare you a long assessment of the piece, which discredits itself right from the start, but I will draw your attention to the conclusion.“Mutual support is overdue: by seeking a cooperative, rather than adversarial, approach between players on the same side, defenders against malign influence can help mitigate the effects of propaganda outlets rather than providing them with material,”Giles writes. In other words, the lobbyist is telling Hutchings and Tolz not to break ranks in the future and to remember which side they are supposed to be representing. Even if that side is clearly shooting itself in the foot by spreading ‘disinformation' in the name of fighting against it. He's also upset that RT reported on Reframing Russia's analysis of EUvsDisinfo. Thus, he basically takes more than 3,300 words to say what it's clear he wanted to state from the start: Objectivity in evaluation of Russian media could derail a gravy train which is keeping a lot of people in well-paid employment. After all, once decision-makers realise that the ‘Russian disinformation’ racket is an almighty con, the cash spigot will quickly disappear, and its practitioners will be left with a redundant set of ‘skills’. They won't exactly be inundated with offers of work. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"11 May, 2020",'Everything's up for grabs': Soros sees big opportunities after Covid-19 'endangers our civilization',"Billionaire currency speculator George Soros has hailed the Covid-19 pandemic as the crisis of his lifetime, all but salivating over the chance to remake society amid the “revolutionary moment” he claims preceded the virus. “Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible, but probably absolutely necessary,” Soros told Project Syndicate on Monday. “And then came Covid-19.” Acknowledging the “unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination…really endangers the survival of our civilization,” the philanthropist warned “we will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started.” Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve. While he didn’t specify what exactly defined the pre-coronavirus “revolutionary moment” he was referring to, Soros has in recent months poured $1 billion of his prodigious fortune into setting up a university network to fight “nationalism” and climate change, calling the initiative “the most important project of my life.” And he returned to that subject in Monday’s interview, hinting that the political lives of both Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump – whom he slimed as “dictator” and wannabe-dictator, respectively – were coming to an end. The crisis would bring nations closer “in the long run,” he predicted, even if in the short term they “hurt themselves” out of fear. China’s battle with the coronavirus had left Xi “perhaps vulnerable,” Soros speculated, declaring himself to be “on the side of those who believe in an open society. And there are many people in China who are very much in favor of an open society too.” Soros’ Open Society Foundations have played a prominent role in fomenting “color revolutions” in societies lacking in Soros-determined “openness,” adding a potential layer of threat to what on the surface sounded benign. But despite essentially agreeing with Trump that “we must protect our democratic open society” by not working too closely with China, Soros maintained his revulsion for the American leader. “I will also say that I have put my faith in Trump to destroy himself, and he has exceeded my wildest expectations,” he said. Soros-funded groups have been working to remove Trump from power practically since he took office, more recently focusing their efforts on a mail-in voting campaign Republicans have claimed would open the door to unprecedented levels of voter fraud. Soros himself, meanwhile, had accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg of colluding with the Trump campaign to help Trump secure reelection, going so far as todemandhis removal from control of the social media platform if he did not halt all political advertising. In fact, Soros sees dictators everywhere, especially menacing the EU. In his native Hungary, he said, “Viktor Orban has already used the Covid-19 emergency and a captured parliament to appoint himself dictator.” He also seemed pained by the notion of Germany’s legal challenge to Brussels on quantitative easing, expressing concern that other countries might “follow its example” and start placing their own laws above the EU’s if the alliance didn’t immediately slap down upstarts like Hungary and Poland when they “violate EU law.” “If the German court’s verdict prevents the EU from resisting these developments, it will be the end of the EU as we know it,” he warned. Italy leaving the EU would also kill the alliance, he added. The coronavirus pandemic exposed cracks in the continental alliance as European nations turned on one another in the scramble for supplies and closed their borders in a bid to keep out the virus. Italy in particular was hit hard, only to have its cries for aid largely ignored by its neighbors and Brussels. When help did come, it came from unexpected quarters – Russia, China, Cuba – or in the form of token gestures bordering on the insulting, as with Germany’sofferto take in a few dozen of Italy’s 80,000-plus coronavirus patients to relieve the strain on its healthcare system. Along with Spain and France, Italy faces a ruined economy as its citizens emerge from lockdown – some 700,000 children under 15 lack adequate food,accordingto an Italian farming organization – while the EU has remained reluctant to provide financial assistance.

"5 Apr, 2020","Market speculations, not real demand, sank Russian oil to 20-year lows","The swings in the oil market are mainly caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of a deal between the OPEC and major exporters of crude. However, some analysts believe that there are more factors behind the market rout. The price for Russian Urals oil blend fell to $10.54 per barrel (CIF Rotterdam) on April 2, the weakest level since March 1999. Despite having managed to rebound since then, the rally could be short-term and just a reaction to a possible big oil deal, independent economic analyst Narek Avakyan told RT, explaining that demand is still going to fall amid the pandemic and worldwide boost in oil output. “The surplus of nearly 20 million barrels per day is a catastrophic situation,”he said, adding that crude storages are running out of space forcing some companies to give away some amounts of oil. While most analysts agree that the Covid-19 and the uncertainty on new output curbs are definitely the main factors sinking oil prices, the current situation on the energy market could be the result of massive speculations, according to Rustam Tankaev, leading expert at the Russian Union of Oil and Gas Industrialists and the head of the Infotek-Terminal consultancy. “It is a necessary evil that comes with every crisis, it’s called speculators,”the strategist said in a phone interview.“When the market is very unstable, transactions conducted by them are quite effective. Whole fortunes are made in a few days, that’s how [George] Soros got rich.” Tankaev believes the turmoil cannot last long, as all the participants of the markets are resisting it. Additionally, he expects that the supply glut will be over in the near future, because low oil not only affects US shale companies, but also American and Middle East producers of synthetic motor fuel. Both are cost effective only if crude trades at around $60 per barrel, and their collapse would deprive the market of 10 million barrels per day, which is enough to boost demand. Not all the analysts support this forecast, with chief analyst at Premier BCS, Sergey Suverov, noting that everything now depends on how long the coronavirus outbreak will hold.“For now the situation is not improving, the economic damage remains high and could be even higher if the quarantine lasts for several months,”he said. Apart from the containment of the deadly virus, the success of talks between Russia and OPEC members, that are expected to be held next week, could be another key to crisis resolution.“Oil prices will rise even more if there is a new deal. Even better, if US producers join in [the output cuts],”said economist Valery Mironov, Deputy Director of Center of Development Institute at the Higher School of Economics. Washington has not signaled so far that it is ready to support any restrictions on its oil industry, with US President Donald Trump saying that he has never been fan of the “illegal” OPEC “cartel.” However, analysts believe that a broader agreement could be an effective tool to solve the current crisis, since the previous accord failed to bring long-term results. “The previous form of OPEC deal had to cease existence sooner or later,”Andrey Kolpakov, senior researcher at the Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IEF RAS), told RT.“If this scenario [with the participation of the US] comes into reality, it would more effective mechanism to stabilize the market.” For more stories on economy & finance visitRT's business section  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"25 Feb, 2020",Credibility of European Court of Human Rights lies in ruins after judges’ links to Soros revealed,"A study by the European Center for Law and Justice in Strasbourg has revealed several conflicts of interest between judges at the European Court of Human Rights and NGOs funded by George Soros. The European Center for Law and Justice is an NGO which often appears at the court to campaign on social, family and religion-related issues. I am proud to be listed as a research fellow at the ECLJ but in reality I have written only onearticlefor the center’s website and I receive no salary from it. I had no role in writing thereport. The study has found that, out of the 100 judges who have served on the bench of the European Court of Human Rights in the period 2009-2019, nearly a quarter (22) have strong links to George Soros’ Open Society Foundation or to NGOs like Amnesty International and others which are funded by it. Human Rights Watch, for instance, has received $100 million from the Open Society Foundation since 2010. Some of the NGOs receive so much of their budget from Soros that they are in effect wholly owned subsidiaries of his foundation. The links between the judges and the NGOs are substantial. They include working for years as members of the board of directors or executive council of these NGOs; having teaching posts at institutes funded by them; being a salaried director of programs for the Open Society Foundation or associated NGOs; and undertaking other forms of paid work for them. The full list of these links can be found on pages seven and eight of thereport. A good example is that of the Bulgarian Yonko Grozev who, as leader of the Open Society Justice Initiative, defended the Pussy Riot case against Russia in 2018 before being elected as a judge of the court shortly thereafter. The study does not include less formal forms of collaboration with NGOs, such as occasional work for them (see note 15 of the report). This means that the links are even greater than those specifically addressed in the study. The report also covers other human rights officers, such as the commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe from 2012-2018 (Nils Muiznieks), who does not sit as a judge but who was for years a salaried activist of the Open Society Foundation in Latvia and who has used his official position to campaign against the so-called“anti-Soros”legislation in Hungary. These NGOs are extremely active at the ECHR. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in Poland filed 16 applications, and defended 32 cases, in 2017 alone. Very often the role played by the NGOs does not appear in the court’s records but has to be discovered from the NGOs’ own reports instead. For instance, a case can be defended by lawyers from one NGO with pleas heard from other NGOs as third parties, even though the other organizations are in fact financed by the same source as the applicant, usually Soros. There would not be anything wrong with judges having exercised a salaried activity for an NGO prior to becoming a judge if these same organizations were not themselves active as parties who bring cases to the ECHR, either as applicants themselves, as lawyers for applicants, or as third parties giving supposedly expert evidence (but in reality lobbying for a cause), and if those judges did not then hear those cases. Indeed, the report’s worst finding is that in 88 cases judges sat on the bench ruling on cases brought to the court by NGOs they had previously worked for, without declaring a conflict of interest and without withdrawing from hearing the cases (see page 15 of the report and annexes 1 and 2.) In one case, ruled on in 2018, 10 out of the 14 NGOs that had brought the case were funded by the Open Society Foundation, while six out of the 17 judges who heard the case themselves had links to the same Soros-funded group. The judges’ refusal to withdraw is a disgraceful professional failing which shows that Europe’s supreme human rights body is not, in fact, independent but is instead part of veritable“human rights industry”– a pyramid of money and a tight network of professional relationships, at the top of which sits George Soros with his billions. NGOs are supposed to represent“civil society”independent of states; in reality, a very large number of them are the creation of actors with no democratic legitimacy, like the Open Society Foundation. The fact that this corrupt system has been able to flourish has several causes. The first is that Soros and the NGOs he finances dominate the human rights industry across the Balkans and in the Baltic states. His millions flood these small, poor countries (he has spent $131 million in Albania since 1992, for instance) and they in turn appoint judges to the ECHR which rules on human rights issues for the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. Indeed, the report finds that the total spending of the Open Society Foundation in Europe, $90 million a year, actually exceeds the annual budget of the European Court of Human Rights ($70 million). Second, new procedures introduced in 2012 specifically provide for NGOs to take part in the selection procedure for judges at the ECHR. These NGOs can propose candidates and they can lobby for their selection. They have done this on many occasions, as the report shows. In the case of Albania in 2018, for instance, two out of the three candidates were executives of the Open Society Foundation; one of them was elected. Finally, there is no requirement that people appointed to be judges at the ECHR have any judicial experience at all. Some 51 out of the 100 judges who have sat on the ECHR bench since 2009 had never been judges or magistrates before. Instead, they were very often human rights activists working for Soros or one of his front organisations. This is a structural weakness which also affects international war crimes tribunals. As I showed in my book, ‘Travesty,’ it means that people can wield judicial power who are not, in fact, trained judges or magistrates or even necessarily lawyers, but instead political activists. In some very egregious cases, people have become judges on the benches of these tribunals without even having a law degree. The result is that the judges who sit on these bodies do not, in fact, behave as judges should.  The role of the judge is to say what the law is, not to say what he or she thinks the law should be. Unfortunately, this is exactly what judges at the ECHR, and at the new international tribunals, do. In 1978, the ECHR proclaimed that the Convention was“a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions”and that therefore its judges had the right to read new things into the Convention instead of agreeing to be bound by it. Such judicial activism is a travesty of the rule of law. It is a travesty because the areas in which ECHR judges exercise their judicial activism are precisely the most politically sensitive issues, which should properly be decided by politicians in elected parliaments, or by referenda, and not by an elite caste of unaccountable activists. Those areas include freedom of expression, asylum, LGBT rights, conditions of detention, minority rights, and so on. Using their freedom to make up the law, ECHR judges have over decades applied a new vision of man which is the opposite of the original intention of the Convention, which was to protect human beings and their families from abusive state power. Now the ECHR spends most of its time demanding more state power for this or that fashionable (“woke”) cause. George Soros has long been attacked for the excessive political power his gigantic fortune has bought, especially in post-communist Eastern Europe. This report by the European Center for Law and Justice is, however, one of the first occasions in which the corrupting effect of that power has been scrupulously identified and documented with respect to the supreme body charged with protecting human rights in Europe. To date, the ECHR has not denied any of the facts outlined in the report and, to the extent that these facts cannot be denied because they come from the ECHR itself, its credibility as an independent judicial body now lies in ruins.

"17 Jan, 2020",Soros-linked political pressure group Avaaz joins forces with MSM to purge climate skeptics from YouTube,"Independent mainstream media outlets are engaging in a politically-motivated campaign to force YouTube to demonetize and hide any video that denies climate change. is a writer and journalist from the US. Outside of her work on RT, she is a primary writer for Colin Moriarty's Side Quest content, and she manages her own YouTube channel. Follow her on Twitter@SophNar0747 is a writer and journalist from the US. Outside of her work on RT, she is a primary writer for Colin Moriarty's Side Quest content, and she manages her own YouTube channel. Follow her on Twitter@SophNar0747 Publishedon Avaaz’s website, the left-leaning non-profit group released a report on January 16 that claims YouTube is profiting by broadcasting misinformation to millions of people by giving climate denial videos too much prominence. The report is an undisguised intimidation campaign, as not only does it list major advertizers who are running ads on videos that question the legitimacy of the threat climate change poses for humanity, but it explicitly calls for them to put pressure on the platform as a means of putting an end to the so-called disinformation. Despite the findings being published just yesterday, many mainstream sites had lengthy articles posted not long after that, which featured quotes from those who worked on the report. Timings which suggest select websites were given early access, making it clear what agenda is being pushed, more so as they all tout the same talking points. Vice, Time, Gizmodo, The Verge, and countless other news entities want YouTube to punish creators who don’t toe the“correct”ideological line. The objective is to demonetize, and thus censor, such individuals as they’ll be less inclined to work on content that they won’t be able to profit from. Nell Greenburg, a campaign director at Avaaz, claims the report isn’t about removing content, but that contradicts the report’s own messaging. There is a clear attempt to have content hidden as the report calls into question the promotion of such videos in the“up next”box on the site. It’s semantics at this point, but hiding videos would hurt creators and dissuade them from even trying to share their thoughts. It is an indirect way of removing ‘wrongthink.’ YouTube has already called into question the methodology of the report, but, given the media and powerful activist groups are targeting advertisers such as Nintendo, Red Bull, Uber, and Warner Bros, it’s a safe assumption the platform giant will give into their demands if their bottom line ever becomes affected. We are less than one year removed from Vox Media’s war on Google and its subsequent“adpocalypse,”after all. Samsung has already contacted the company to“resolve the current issue and prevent future repetition,”so a second adpocalypse is probably likely. Though, this time, the scale could change as residing in the crosshairs isn’t just independent creators, but Fox News and other right-leaning media, given that they, too, have content on YouTube that questions the validity of a changing climate. That the MSM agrees with this says a whole lot, since many websites are in no position to push a platform into limiting content they deem as false, especially when considering the one-sided nature of their many blunders. If 2019 was any indication, they’re not exactly on top of stuff. From the reaction to the Covington school kids, to the countless Trump and Russia stories that went nowhere and fizzled, the most blatant purveyors of literal fake news are the mainstream media. As for George Soros’ connection with Avaaz, while it claims to be predominantly member-funded now, its seed money was reportedlyallocatedby the billionaire’sopaquenetwork of groups, and various prominent figures from his Open Society Foundation, such as former Democratic congressman Tom Periello, havebeenamong its leadership. Leaked documents from 2010detailthat promoting climate change campaigns was always designated as a primary function of Avaaz. This situation ultimately raises questions into why anyone, or anything, should have the power to dictate what others can create. Regardless of one’s personal views on the matter, there’s no denying that bold claims have been made about the climate that later were disproven. Little is, as yet, set in stone, and content that lands on any one side of the debate should be free to exist. If a creator is making videos people are watching, their hard work shouldn’t be thrown in the bin simply because an activist group with ties to one of the world’s richest people and his proxies says so. It is not the role of billionaires and their pet projects to play babysitter. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"25 Oct, 2019",George Soros says all his ‘enemies’ are wannabe dictators as he drops unprecedented wads of lobbying cash,"In the world of billionaire financier George Soros, his critics are “would-be dictators” who will not succeed. Meanwhile, under Trump, the Open Society founder has been pouring greater sums into lobbying than ever before. “I’m very proud of the enemies I have,” he told the New York Times in an interview published Friday, in which he confidently predicted the popular opposition to his globalist philosophy was winding down and that a backlash against Trump-style nationalism was on the horizon. It’s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would-be dictator, if he identifies me as an enemy. Soros slammed the US president as“an aberration,”predicting“what he has done in the Middle East”– clearing troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, allowing peace to break out with a deal between Russia and Turkey –“will contribute to his demise next year.” Trump has called out Soros in the past, accusing him of paying the protesters who swarmed the Capitol over Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and hinting that he was bankrolling the migrant caravans that swarmed the US’ southern border last year. Soros is a popular villain among conservatives, who suspect that, after funding color revolutions in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, he is trying to start one in the US. The currency speculation that has made him enemies from Malaysia to Britain has also made him rich enough to contribute billions toward funding what are usually described as “progressive causes” through his Open Society Foundations. And he is spending more than ever on those causes, dumping some $15.9 million to influence Congress in just the third quarter of 2019 via his foundation’s lobbying division, the Open Society Policy Center, according to a recent filing. It’s a jump even over the group’s 2018 expenditures, which, at $31.5 million, made it the third-largest lobbying group that year. Only the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors outspent the billionaire. Aside from lobbying, Soros spreads his money around liberally in more ways than one. He has funded media organizations like Democracy Now! and Media Matters, pro-immigration groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Migration Policy Institute, think tanks like the Aspen Institute and the Center for American Progress, fundraising organizations like MoveOn.org that stages anti-Trump protests, and interventionist policy groups like the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. He has already donated millions to the Democratic Party for 2020. “There are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets,” he said, calling Elizabeth Warren – who wants to tax the wealthy heavily – the most qualified person to be president. Soros also has a""mortal enemy""- China,  the nation that fought a winning battle against his currency speculating in 1998, so now he calls “Xi Jinping’s China the worst threat to an open society.” Given what has happened to the other societies Soros has poured money into, Xi might take that as a compliment.

"5 Jul, 2019",Gangster mayors and oligarch’s dirty money: Will former criminals hold on to power in Ukraine?,"As Ukraine braces for an early parliamentary vote, its political elites are desperately looking for ways to forge alliances that would be of benefit in the new political environment. Some deals, however, look shadier than others. While Ukraine’s major political parties led by former President Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are preparing to face off, as well as the newly formed party of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a parliamentary election, some political figures with a long criminal history also want a piece of the pie. One of the leaders of the newlyformed‘Opposition Bloc’ who made it to the top of its election list, Gennady Trukhanov, appears to have a particularly gruesome criminal history behind him. Since 2014, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odessa – Ukraine’s largest port and the third most populous city. He is a political veteran who has been building his career in Ukraine’s upper echelons of power for about a decade and a half. Yet, his fine appearance hides the fact that he was once a member of a notorious gang which was allegedly involved in smuggling arms and drugs. According to a 2018 BBCreport, the gang, which came into being in the 1990s, was linked to some particularly gruesome murders. Trukhanov, who is involved in martial arts and has been thepresidentof the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation of Muay Thai since 2003, trained members of the gang in“hand-to-hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons,”the BBC said, citing data from Italian police. A reportcompiledby Italian law enforcement in the late 1990s names Trukhanov as one of the leaders of the gang who had extensive contacts with Ukrainian law enforcement. He was also said to enjoy close ties with another gang leader – a notorious crime lord called Aleksandr Angert, aka Sasha Angel. Angert was sentenced to 15 years in prison for premeditated murder in 1980, but was released 10 years later as he was allegedly suffering from stomach cancer, which, however, apparently did not stop him from taking a leading role in another gang – along with Trukhanov. Later, Angert, one of Odessa’s most influential crime lords, moved to London, where he has lived ever since and allegedly moved from crime to business, dissolving his gangs. However, he reportedlyretainedhis close ties with his now‘business partner’Trukhanov. The criminal-turned-mayor, meanwhile, apparently did not wipe the slate clean after moving away from gang activities. A 2016reportby the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), citing the Panama Papers, revealed that the mayor owns an entire business empire in Ukraine controlled through offshore firms registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is actively involved in embezzlement and money laundering. Another Opposition Bloc leader who found his way to the top of the election list is Gennady Kernes, the longstanding mayor of Kharkov. For about two decades, he has ruled over the nation’s second most populous city (almost 1.5 million people), also a large industrial and science center. He managed to retain his post through a range of political cataclysms, from the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought Yushchenko to power, to the 2014 Maidan coup. He has, however, a few skeletons in the closet. According to an extensivereportpublished by an investigative media project called ‘Criminal Ukraine’, the now respectable mayor started his career in the 1990s as a fraudster, whose gang ran several shady schemes. Eventually, they decided to“expand”their“business”and move from fraud to blackmail and extortion. Kernes’ gang was even suspected of murder at one point, but those charges were apparently not proven. Eventually, Kernes (nicknamed Gepa) was arrested, but only sentenced to three years in prison, and was set free two years later due to“active repentance.”Following his release, the future mayor turned to privatization and managed to obtain quite a number of assets in Kharkov, including factories and real estate, through shady schemes, eventually emerging as a“wealthy businessman.” Later, he allegedly used his influence to exert pressure on his political rivals and to gag journalists who dared to mention his criminal past in their reports. Kharkov Region is located right next to the tumultuous Eastern Ukrainian regions, parts of which refused to recognize Kiev’s authority following the 2014 Maidan coup and declared themselves the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR). As Kiev still struggles to regain control over the rebellious Donbass republics, having people like Kernes and Trukhanov at the helm of the regional governments will hardly give it much legitimacy in the eyes of the people there. Other Ukrainian media reports suggest that Kernes enjoys close ties to controversial Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who is suspected by some of being the real‘puppet master’behind Zelensky’s recent landslide victory in the presidential election. KernesvisitedKolomoisky in Israel ahead of the presidential runoff, according to one such report. The billionaire dismissed the idea of any“hidden agenda”behind the trip, telling the media that Kernes went to Israel“for medical reasons”and met him by coincidence. Kolomoisky, an oligarch who made a fortune during the privatization frenzy in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, might yet turn out to be the one pulling the strings in the newly-formed political bloc. A sort of Ukrainian George Soros, Kolomoisky gained a reputation of being a shadowy figure seeking to influence politics. Unlike Soros, he does not seem to have any particular ideological preference. Instead, he apparently tries to place his millions on the winning horse. Over the last decade and a half, he has supported the Orange Revolution, former President Viktor Yushchenko, and then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. He attained particular infamy in the wake of the Maidan coup, when he created his own paramilitary force bysponsoringanti-Russia battalions. Kolomoisky initially financed the notorious ultranationalist Azov Battalion for months in 2014. He is now reportedly one of the major backers of the Opposition Bloc. He does not really hide this fact either. In May, headmittedhe was“consulting”the party created by Trukhanov and Kernes, which he called“an All-Ukrainian project.”He also held talks with a leader of another party that eventually joined the bloc. “We have common issues. The commercial and political ones,”he told Ukrainian Pravda back then, adding that some“unsuccessful projects need a reboot.”The billionaire specifically mentioned“aligning”forces and creating a“broader”agenda as a recipe for moving forward. Kernes then rushed todownplaythe oligarch’s influence on his party by saying that he neither financed nor“consulted”the party, while calling his contacts with Kolomoisky a“private matter.” As Zelensky’s presidential victory clearly shows that Ukrainians have grown tired of the old political ways, tainted by corrupt elites linked to organized crime, he has apparently embraced the idea of rebranding and renewal – at least on the surface. Whether the dark past will still loom over the bright future they claim to offer remains to be seen. Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

"4 Jul, 2019",Soros and Koch funding new ‘anti-war’ think tank— and we should probably be a little bit suspicious,"There’s a new “anti-war” think tank coming to town. It will promote a new US foreign policy — one based on diplomacy instead of sanctions and war. Sounds great, until you hear it's being funded by Soros and Koch. is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin. Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others. Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin. Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others. Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ The ‘Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft’ will oppose Washington’s“endless wars”and will“challenge the basis of American foreign policy in a way that has not been done in at least the last quarter-century,”according to co-founder Trita Parsi. With financier George Soros coming from the left (though he’s hardly a real leftist) and industrialist CharlesKoch coming from the right, everyone is supposed to applaud the bipartisan nature of the initiative. The Boston Globe called it“one of the most remarkable partnerships in modern American political history”as though the two billionaire businessmen come from alternate universes. The Globe notes that promoting an anti-war message is“radical notion,”given that nearly every major think tank in Washington currently promotes“some variant of neocon militarism or liberal interventionism.” To give credit where it’s due, this really is a radical notion — and the more the anti-war narrative begins to trickle into the mainstream, the better. If the Quincy Institute does what it says on the tin, most genuine anti-war activists and readers won’t quibble too much about where the think tank got its start-up cash. Soros and Koch have thrown $500,000 each into the pot. Named after John Quincy Adams, who declared in 1821 that the US“goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy""but is the“well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all”and the“champion and vindicator only of her own,”the think tank will offer a platform to both progressive voices and anti-interventionist conservatives. The Globe writes that this will mean its writers will""likely""advocate for things like pulling US troops out of Afghanistan and Syria, putting an end to regime change wars and“less confrontational”policies toward China and Russia. The problem here is not the concept. It’s just a question of whether or not the venture can actually be taken seriously when Soros and Koch’s fingerprints are already all over the world’s current endless wars, conflicts and regime changes. Take some well-known Soros-funded think tanks; the Center for American Progress and the Atlantic Council, for example. They haven’t exactly been the biggest peace-pushers in the think tank world. The AC also received funding from a slew of arms manufacturers, so you’d be hard-pressed to find any anti-war sentiment there. Soros has also beenlinkedto the""pro-democracy""European group Avaaz, which has advocated for no-fly zones in Libya and agitated for regime change in Venezuela and Iran. In 2017, the Soros-funded ‘European Values’ think tanksmeared2,327 people as""useful idiots""for Russia for merely appearing on RT, in a McCarthyist-style attack on anyone deemed not to be sufficiently compliant with prevailing Western narratives. Koch too has been linked to havoc-wreaking policies everywhere from Iraq to Venezuela. Despite supposedly opposing the Iraq war, independent journalist Caitlin Johnstonenotesthat Koch has been a major donor to the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute, whose members are considered leading architects of the invasion. The Quincy Institute is slated to launch in September and until it gets off the ground, it will be impossible to declare a final judgement on its work — but given that organizations funded by Soros and Koch have spouted war-promoting propaganda to serve the US imperialist agenda for years, it’s a little difficult to see this sudden change of heart as entirely genuine.

"4 Jun, 2019",Euromaidan activist with neo-Nazi links joins Facebook as public policy manager,"A Ukrainian activist who rejoiced at the sight of 48 anti-Maidan protesters burning to death in Odessa in 2014 has been hired by Facebook ostensibly to combat Russian ‘disinformation’. Kateryna Kruk will be working out of Warsaw in her new role as Facebook’s public policy manager for Ukraine. While Kruk’s immediate duties are not clear, the announcement was met with enthusiasm by her followers, hoping she wouldunleasha crackdown on‘Kremlin trolls’.  Kruk has an unequivocal anti-Russian reputation, having written for several international publications and on Twitter. Kruk shot to prominence at the height of the mass protests that preceded the 2014 armed coup in Kiev, becoming a‘spokesman for Euromaidan’as she live-tweeted in English from the first days of the two-month protest. As the movement was hijacked by right-wing nationalists led by the Right Sector and the far-right, borderline neo-Nazi Svoboda party, the situation quickly spiraled into violence. Around that time, Kruk worked as a staffer for Svoboda,praisingthe party for being“Ukrainian-focused,”while expressing some reservations about its hardline ultra-nationalist ideology. Kruk might have had some concerns about the party, whichembracedUkrainian nationalist leader and Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera as a hero, but it did not deter her from gloating over the deaths of several dozen of her political opponents in Odessa’s trade union building in May 2014, which was set on fire by football hooligans as police seemingly stood by watching. The people whoburnedto death and suffocated inside the building were peacefully protesting the coup in the central city square before being attacked by the rowdy gangs.

"24 May, 2019",West-backed think tanks threaten new Ukrainian president with disturbing list of ‘RED LINES’,"When President Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide victory in the free and undisputed April elections, most accepted that he was given a fairly strong mandate to lead Ukraine. But it seems not everyone is so democratically-minded. Particularly unmoved by the democratic process are a collection of Ukrainian 'civil society' groups, who have just issued alengthy listof“red lines not to be crossed”by the new president, lest he risk provoking a new wave of political instability – that they would presumably instigate. Issuing their catalog of demands on Thursday, the groups claim to be“politically neutral”but“deeply concerned”about the first actions taken by the comedian-turned-politician Zelensky, including his decision to appoint members of former President Viktor Yanukovych's government to positions within his own government. Various civil society groups in#Ukrainehave issued a list of red lines that they don't want president@ZelenskyyUato cross, saying there'll be unrest if he does. It's the longest list of red lines I've ever seen. Twittosphere, what do you make of it?https://t.co/jgHAIIAciS A scan of the undersigned reveals that many of these“civil society groups”are anything but politically neutral. In fact, quite a few of them are partly funded by the US government, various EU governments (including the UK), the European Commission itself – and, of course, the omnipresent liberal billionaire George Soros. The list includes the notorious Euromaidan Press, Stop Fake and Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, to name just a few. In their heyday, many of these groups acted as propaganda tools of the Western-backed government of Petro Poroshenko, rather than the watchdogs they claim to be. They now confirm that a pesky election isn’t going to stand in the way of their agenda, reaffirming that their own“principles and positions”on issues remain unchanged and warning: Should [Zelensky] cross these red lines, such actions will inevitably lead to political instability in our country... This statement, which precedes the wide-ranging list of red lines, reads like a threat: Do what we say, or there will be trouble. Isn’t that a strange, almost dictatorial approach for groups purporting to be interested in""democracy,"" ""freedom,""and""dignity”?Did we all miss the part where a group of think tanks were collectively elected president of Ukraine? This list of demands by western-funded Ukraine NGOs—threatening to overthrow Zelenskiy if he doesn't follow their demands—perfect example of Arundhati Roy's critique of ""civil society"" as an elite construct designed to subvert & control popular democracyhttps://t.co/j33iGoSqOA Of course, these groups do indeed represent various factions of Ukrainian society and many of them no doubt have worthy aims, and they should continue their work unimpeded. But they do not represent all of Ukrainian society and they certainly do not have the authority to set the political agenda and lay down the law to the incoming government – and that, quite literally, is what they are trying to do. It's such a gobsmackingly odd list of demands that even Western journalists who had a broadly friendly relationship with the Poroshenko government are aghast at their audacity. The list is broken down into issues of security, foreign policy, economy, national identity (language, education and culture), media and government functioning. On security, the groups want to forbid Zelensky from""achieving compromise""with Russia in any manner that would be""to the detriment""of the national interest, presumably as defined by themselves. Inhibiting the implementation of security and defense policies outlined in a 2016 decree signed by Poroshenko is also forbidden, they say. do these cronies not know how democracy works, or just not care? Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda--they don't get to continue setting it like the election never happened. In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically-elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the""reduction or lifting""of sanctions on Russia by Western powers. He may not take any action""delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting""the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine. Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with""the IMF and other foreign partners."" It’s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though. The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even “review” multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti-Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious ""de-communization” which banned Soviet symbols in the country. Ironically, this push for de-communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko’s virulently anti-Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell’s 1984 than a modern democracy. The“NGOs”insist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another 'red line' among their national identity demands. Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian? Well, Zelensky will also be in big trouble if he tries to restore them, the“civil society groups”say. READ MORE: Reality bites: Ukraine’s President Zelensky puts showbiz pals in positions of real power The most vague red line of all comes near the end of the list, when the new president is warned against“ignoring dialogue with civil society”– a command so vague that“almost anything”Zelensky does going forward could be interpreted as ignoring their wishes, France 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg wrote on Twitter. BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher tweeted that the groups themselves may have crossed a red line –  the red line of""what civil society groups can legitimately demand of a freshly elected government."" I feel like almost anything he does could be interpreted as crossing one or other of those lines, they’re so wide ranging  It reads like a manifesto - there's an election in 2 months. Make a party - see if anyone agrees with you - that's democracy. Zelensky was elected to office with 73 percent of the vote – and let’s not forget, he won that election having campaigned against many of the policies these ‘civil society’ groups are aggressively demanding be kept in place. He has been in office only a matter of days, and these Western-backed groups are threatening to instigate political unrest should he take any action that they don’t find acceptable to their political agenda.

"22 May, 2019",Is Soros-linked Avaaz group a credible source on fake news? Mainstream media seems to think so,"Mainstream news outlets have eagerly reported on a study by the Avaaz campaign group, claiming far-right disinformation groups have been spreading fake news in the lead up to EU elections — but is the group all that it seems? The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing“people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere”and it’s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far-right and anti-EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections. The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right-wing and anti-establishment groups and parties — and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial. Be like Captain Von Trapp - reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week. EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23-26!pic.twitter.com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls — but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non-partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different. Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning. While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon.org (which has been partly funded by left-wing Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros) — and its co-founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda. Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello. Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context? Independent journalists have had suspicions about Avaaz’s own activity for years, noting its strong pro-establishment and globalist leanings, which have even translated into outward support for US regime change wars around the world. When the group is notpushingfor no-fly zones in LibyaandSyria, oragitatingfor regime change in Venezuela and Iran, it is actively supporting centrist, neoliberal political figures across the EU and US. Patel told the EUobserver last year that the“majority”of people across Europe“stand with”German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has also activelysupportedFrench President Emmanuel Macron with online videos and petitions. While Avaaz is seemingly very concerned with the plight of citizens in places like Venezuela and Iran (it was also activelyinvolvedin promoting Iran’s ‘Green Revolution’ in 2009), it appears to be less concerned with the lives of ordinary Europeans. The group has targeted the anti-Macron Yellow Vest movement in France and framed the protesters easy targets for spreading“fake news”— and to put the icing on the cake, blamed the swift spread of this alleged fake news on Russia, another of Avaaz’s favorite targets. Indeed, unsurprisingly, media reporting on so-called election meddling ahead of EU elections has taken on an anti-Russia hue, with many suggesting that disinformation groups are simply ‘copying Russian tactics’ from the 2016 US election, when the Democratic Party claimed Russian disinformation campaigns were a major factor in Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump — a claim for which there remains exactly zero evidence. One of these reports on the alleged copycat tactics quotes Ben Nimmo, a former NATO press officer, cited with regularity by mainstream journalists as though he is an impartial source. Like clockwork, Nimmo popped up ahead of the EU elections to claim that“domestic actors”across Europe are now simply“doing what the Russians had already been doing”— because it’s easier to blame Russia for social discord in Europe than failed leadership and unpopular policies. Once again, it appears that many of the groups claiming to help people recognize fake news online are some of the biggest and sneakiest purveyors of disinformation themselves — and they are frequently promoted by mainstream news outlets — if they are selling the correct narrative, that is. Mainstream media continue to quote the founders of cybersecurity firm New Knowledge as credible experts on Russian disinformation tactics, even after the firm wasexposedby the New York Times for having run its own disinformation campaign during a 2017 Alabama senate race. The New Knowledge crowd set up fake Russian social media accounts to ‘support’ one candidate and then worked to publicly brand him as Moscow’s pick. By not even mentioning Avaaz’s own sketchy links, and very clear political leanings, Western news reports citing its studies as completely credible and independent are simply engaging in their own kind of disinformation.

If the US Embassy had limited Fedchenko to describing""the difference between journalism and propaganda,""it wouldn't have been a bad interview. Because, after all, perhaps a propagandist is the best person to describe the variance between the two concepts. As we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, hear from Fulbright Program alumnus Yevhen Fedchenko, Director of the@MohylaJSchool, about freedom of speech, the difference between journalism and propaganda, exchange programs, and principles of good journalismhttps://t.co/6QCd2qAzkD However, when the ditsy diplomats decided to also air the""StopFake""supremo's opinion on""freedom of speech""and""[the] principles of good journalism,""they opened themselves up to ridicule. Let's cut to the chase here. The US/UKmediahas beentellingporkiesabout""StopFake""foryears. The outfit's purpose isn't some gallant effort to battle""disinformation.""Instead, it functions as a propaganda arm of the Ukrainian government. Initially it was focused on what Kiev perceives as its""information war""with Russia, but recently its efforts seem to be increasingly domestic-focused. About 4 years late with that What's even more funny is how they've managed to get foreigners to pay for it, withfundingcoming from Hungarian billionaire George Soros, the Swedish heiress Sigrid Rausing, and the governments of Czechia and the United Kingdom.  This appears to back up the notion that there's one born every minute. Man who smears press w/o evidence as ""Kremlin agents,"" backs group@StateDeptcalls ""nat'list hate group,"" etc., shouldn't be given platform to discuss issues below. Disappointing@USEmbassyKyivdidn't get a true press freedom champion such as one of Ukraine's many indie journos.https://t.co/qPTNzg67B3 ""StopFake""seems to have one basic rule. Any criticism of Ukraine's government is""misinformation,""in itsview– a point noted by none other than Tetiana Popova, Ukraine's former deputy minister of information policy. And, yes, that title is as Orwellian as it sounds. The closeness between the unit and the Kiev authorities is pretty much hiding in plain sight. For instance, one-time""StopFake News""hostNina Jankowicz boasts on herLinkedIn profileabout how she""advised the Spokesperson of the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs""and""liaised with foreign policy advisors across the Ukrainian government… [to] begin a rebranding campaign for Ukraine,""as well as training Ukrainian diplomats. And all this was done while on a US government-funded jolly in Kiev. Meanwhile, another presenter,Marko Suprun, is married to Ukraine's US-born-and-raised health minister,Ulana Suprun. And he's also friendlywithneo-Nazis, who according to""StopFake""don't exist in Ukraine. Instead, reports of their activities are dismissed as false""Kremlin propaganda."" Making the video efforts of both the aforementioned more bizarre is how they are focused on Russian news channels, which are banned in Ukraine, suggesting the clips are more aimed at keeping the Western cash-flow coming than anything else. During this year's Ukrainian election campaign,""StopFake""strongly supported the present government, with Fedchenko's team openly hostile to the eventual winner, Vladimir Zelensky. At one point, Jonah Fisher of British state-broadcaster BBC, even called them out on their bias. Of course, they evaded the point by playing the""Russia card."" we would be happy but as we already said we are dealing with RUSSIAN disinformation, RUSSIAN agents of influence and RUSSIAN subversive activities, including through electoral process. To which of these 3 categories this belongs? The exchange came after Fedchenko had shared a video which purported to show Zelensky's campaign team promoting an interview in which controversial Russian MP Natalia Poklonskaya praised the now-president elect. Poklonskaya is a toxic figure in Ukraine, given that she's a former Ukrainian citizen who, very openly,""defected""to Russia when Moscow reabsorbed Crimea in 2014. The clip was doctored and the Zelensky logo was afabrication. Those of us who watch Ukraine closely know that US officials, think-tankers and activists care not a jot for the country, instead viewing it as a handy geopolitical tool to""contain""and agitate Russia. However, they usually manage to massage that truth with well-meaning rhetoric about""values""and the like. But, occasionally, the mask slips. And this is a good example. The fact that the American embassy chose to publicly amplify Fedchenko as an expert on the""principles of good journalism"" speaks volumes. And, frankly, very few people, even erstwhile cheerleaders of the 2013/14 Maidan, are buying the baloney anymore.

"25 Apr, 2019",Trump’s envoy to Ukraine is paid by none other than Poroshenko himself,"US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker is drawing a salary from John McCain's think tank, which is funded by George Soros and a DC lobbying firm working for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, among others. Volker was appointed Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations in July 2017, by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and has been“mediating”the Ukrainian crisis on behalf of the US ever since in much the same way his colleagueElliott Abramshas been doing with Venezuela. The twist is that Volker is doing this“on a voluntary basiswithout compensation”and“not taxing the taxpayers,”drawing a salary from his day job as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Arizona. Named after the late and hawkish US senator John McCain, the think tank is dedicated to""advancing leadership… in the United States and around the world.""The two positions are very much aligned, Volker has said, allowing him to get his""hands dirty and actually solve our problems."" In practice, that means things like taking part in the""Occupied Crimea: 5 years of resistance""conference in Odessa – the same city where US-backed nationalists burned alive their political opponents in May 2014 – and parroting Bellingcat talking points on the Kerch Strait incident, themselves cribbed from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The 🇺🇸does not and will not accept Russia’s claimed annexation of Crimea. 🇷🇺 has committed numerous human rights abuses in furtherance of its occupation. We will continue to maintain and strengthen sanctions until Crimea is returned.#CrimeaisUkraine.pic.twitter.com/dirC34locX Interesting analysis by Bellingcat with this key conclusion: “the shooting of the ‘Berdyansk’ most likely took place in international waters”Investigating The Kerch Strait Incident via@bellingcathttps://t.co/4dM9Ct8jXw This is not surprising, however, since thelist of donorsof the McCain Institute includes something called the“BGR Foundation.”It shares the same Washington, DC address – and name – with Barbour Griffith Rogers, a high-profile lobbying firm thatlists Volkeras“Senior International Advisor”and former international managing director. According toits filingsto the US Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), BGR is a registered agent for none other than President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, whose ascension to Ukrainian presidency was brought about by the Maidan revolution of 2014, a coup cheered on most fervently by John McCain himself. The“National Reforms Council of Ukraine,”which officially retained BGR's services, is led by none other than Dmytro Shymkiv,“Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine,”as perthe filing BGR sentto the DOJ in January 2017. It remains to be seen whether this relationship will change in June, when TV personality Volodymyr Zelensky takes office, havingtriumphedin a landslide runoff election this past weekend. Judging by Zelensky’sofficial Facebook accountof his February meeting with Volker –“a friend of Ukraine”with whom he“reached full understanding on all questions”– that seems unlikely, however. Volker was very close to the late Senator McCain, who was himself intimately involved with the 2014""revolution""in Kiev, visiting the demonstrators and personally sharing the stage with Socialist-Nationalist Party leader Oleg Tyahnibok, for example. McCain was evenoffered an advisory jobwith Poroshenko, back in 2015, but declined because that was not allowed under US law. Turns out another McCain confidant,David Kramer, also works at Volker’s institute, listed as""senior director for Human Rights and Democracy.""Kramer wasidentifiedas the individual who during the 2016 campaign spread the""Steele Dossier""(accusing Trump of ties with Russia) to the press and a number of other people in Washington, including the""midwife of Maidan""herself, Victoria Nuland. Among the McCain Institute’s other donors are George Soros and his Open Society Foundations, as well as Saudi Arabia – though Volker had to disavow them last year, calling it a one-time donation and saying he won’taccept any more Saudi cashafter the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. All of this adds up to the question no one seems to have asked yet: Whose interests in Ukraine is Kurt Volker actually representing – those of the Trump administration, or those of his donors and the ghost of John McCain?

Report claims ‘US dark money’ meddling in Europe,"A new alarming report claims American Christian conservative groups funneled millions to fund “shocking” meddling in European politics. Seems like a big scoop, or just a ploy to sway European Parliament elections? Thereportreleased by the UK-based political website openDemocracy this week spares no black paint to produce a picture of gross interference in European affairs. The perpetrators are conservative Christian charities, which, the records show, pumped at least $50 million into European countries. All the right names that can scare a left-leaning reader are duly mentioned. Donald Trump? Check. Vladimir Putin? Check. Steve Bannon? Check, three times. Also listed are billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the DeVos family, including Blackwater founder Erik Prince, and the evangelical preacher Franklin Graham – who notably travelled to Russia earlier this month, the report stressed for some arcane reason. #Collusion? I’m in Russia right now—Moscow to be exact—and I’m meeting with the Russian churches on how we can share with more young people about faith in Jesus Christ! That’s not “collusion,” but it is collaboration for the sake of souls. #GoodNews A post shared byFranklin Graham(@franklin_graham) onMar 3, 2019 at 9:10am PST Of course the US public records over the past decade, which openDemocracy used as the source for the figure, don’t identify the recipients. But the readers may well assume that they had the most nefarious goals in mind. “The scale of this meddling by US extremists is shocking, but sadly no surprise to us. Every day European societies face concerted attacks by outside forces seeking to impose reproductive coercion,”commented Caroline Hickson, regional director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation’s European Network.“This is utterly at odds with the European values of democracy and human rights.” The authors make no secret that they compiled their work ahead of the European Parliament elections, which will be held throughout EU member states in late May. Right-wing and Eurosceptic parties are widely expected to score big wins at the ballot. Some 40 incumbent MEPs penned a letter calling for action to investigate“US Christian fundamentalists”and their influence on Europe. Staggering research from ⁦@openDemocracy⁩ on just how vulnerable our politics are to well funded organised malign influences. Proud to have organised a cross party MEP call for action.https://t.co/Lol9yQRgqJ The report seems to be an exercise in scaremongering, painting private donations made by a conservative foundation as something untoward, John Laughland, British conservative author and historian, told RT. “Some of the organizations that they mention I personally know. This is just ridiculous. There are MEPs and European political parties that receive money from American sources, including liberals,”he said. The notion of ‘dark money’ being used to ‘interfere’ in European affairs has been around in some political circles for quite some time. The only difference with this report is that the parties accused of interfering are private charities rather than a foreign nation like Russia, the most popular target for such accusations in the past few years. Perceiving ‘dark money’ behind political opponents is a kind of conspiratorial thinking that some people in the left-wing camp demonstrate, Laughland added.“They think that any kind of movement or current of ideas that is not their current of ideas is either because people are stupid or because they are paid,”he said. The complaints about “Russian election interference” made by the EU and the US, which have a long record of their own meddling in foreign nations, looks like a vivid example of pot calling kettle black, he said. The left complaining about the right receiving foreign money while receiving foreign money themselves would look similarly hypocritical. British Journalist Neil Clark, pointed out that while $50 million may seem like a large sum of money even spent over ten years, it dwarfs compared to the billions and billions floating around in European politics. A significant portion of that money goes to liberal causes funded by wealthy sponsors like Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, the best-known person of that ilk. The impact that his Open Society Foundations made on Europe, especially in the eastern part during post-Soviet transition, is undeniable. Incidentally, the foundation is one of the primary sponsors of openDemocracy itself, alongside US-based groups like National Endowment for Democracy, and the Ford Foundation. Clark warned against piling up a dozen Christian conservative groups into one vaguely neo-Nazi-shaped boogeyman, which is what the report seems to have done. More so, if the goal was to turn it into a campaigning point for the May elections. “The issue that the left should be fighting on is economic. Employment, rising poverty in Europe, austerity – these are the issues they should be focusing on, and not culture wars,”he told RT.“And this report to me seems as if it wants to encourage culture wars… Basically, Steve Bannon versus George Soros.” If left parties do go down that path, it may backfire, Clark said. There are plenty of Christians living in Europe, who vote left. Starting a war with American Christian conservatives would not win votes in Europe. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"27 Mar, 2019",America’s cult of ‘liberal privilege’ lets Jussie Smollett dodge felony bullet,"Instead of facing charges for staging a hate crime, Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett is free without so much as a slap on the wrist. Welcome to the world of liberal privilege, where criminals enjoy full immunity before the law. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge As March madness continues to get madder by the day, it is becoming clear that the United States is not just a country being torn apart by two irreconcilably different ideologies, liberalism and conservatism. It is a country where its inhabitants increasingly reside inside of fenced-off, heavily guarded parallel realities. Whereas the one half is governed by the rule of law and tradition, the other half is guided by raw emotion and hysterical claims of victimhood. The case of Jussie Smollett should make it clear which of those realities is gaining the upper hand. Just days after Robert Mueller wrapped up his years-long investigation of Donald Trump, which exonerated the president of any collusion with Russia, Jussie Smollett also received his share of good news. But that is where the similarities between the two public figures come to a screeching halt. Whereas Trump had received non-stop, politically fueled abuse from the media since the moment Mueller started his 675-day inquisition, Smollett got kid-glove treatment from the very same media, despite the extremely disturbing nature of his charges. For the uninitiated, Smollett wasarrestedfor filing a false police report – a Class 4 felony – with regards to an attack on his person. The ‘Empire’ star said he was the victim of an assault in Chicago in January, in which two white men allegedly beat him, doused him with bleach, and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. In addition to hurling racist and homophobic slurs, the men – according to Smollett – “yelled ‘Make America Great Again’ comments” in the course of the attack. That sounds more like a cheap rendition of the 1988 Hollywood film ‘Mississippi Burning’ than your average winter in Illinois. The takeaway point here is that Mr Smollett orchestrated an actual hate crime based on a volatile cocktail that mixed up race and politics. By appealing to the brutal savagery of America’s pre-civil-rights past, complete with allusions to public lynchings, Smollett was attempting to connect Trump supporters to those historic acts of severe racism. That is about as sick and deranged as it gets. Worse, however, is that this rash and reckless stunt relied upon a reverse form of racism – after all, it is not just whites who are always guilty of racism – that worked to aggravate racial tensions that are always smoldering just below the pavement. Can Michael Flynn get some of the Jussie Smollett privilege?A decorated war hero was entrapped by the feds and now faces $5 million in legal fees for a meaningless process crimeMeanwhile Jussie committed 16 felonies and gets off totally cleanThis is a total injustice Another disturbing part of the fake news story was how so manypeople– especially in the Democratic establishment – willingly rushed to Smollett’s defense before any real investigation had commenced. On that point, would any scandal in America be complete without dropping the name of George Soros? And yes, there does seem to be a connection. It has been reported that Soros donated $408,000 in 2016 to a super PAC that supported State Attorney Kim Foxx, “whose office prosecuted — and dropped — the Jussie Smollett case,” Breitbartreported.  It has even beensuggested, following the release of emails, that Foxx agreed to intervene in the Smollett case on behalf of his family. .@JussieSmollettis one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. But let’s forget about the billionaire interloper for now. The purpose here is to consider the question of justice when it comes to such incidences. The conservatives like to argue that those who inhabit the left side of the political tracks always seem to have a ‘get out of jail free’ card at the crucial moment, while those on the political right must suffer the full brunt of the media industrial complex. A good example of this mediabiasoccurred in January when a group of students from Covington Catholic High School traveled to Washington DC to partake in a protest. During their trip, words were exchanged between them and members of an obscure religious group. At this point, Nathan Phillips, a Native American, walked between the two groups in an apparent effort to defuse the tensions. He approached Covington student, Nick Sandmann, as he continued to beat on a ceremonial drum. What happened next is already well known. Phillips and Sandmann, ‘aggressively’ sporting a red MAGA cap, engaged in what appeared to be a cold stare-down between the two. The media, without doing much research into the matter, jumped to the conclusion that Sandmann and his fellow students were taunting the Indian elder, when, as it later transpired through a video, nothing of the sort had happened. Now the Washington Post isfacinga $250 million lawsuit for its mishandling of the story. Was Sandmann’s grave offense in the eyes of the media being white, Catholic and a Trump supporter? Meanwhile, Smollett’s total exoneration should really not come as a surprise. The trend up until this time points to the fact that liberals have acquired a super sort of immunity when it comes to their behavior, even criminal behavior. The climate of political correctness seems to have given liberals a body armor that repels any accusations made against them. In what other period, for example, could a celebrity hold aloft a severed head effigy of the American president for a promotional photo shoot, as the so-called comedianKathy Griffindid, and not suffer any legal consequences? In fact, Griffincontinuesto play the victim card since pulling the stunt. Then there was the moment when pop queen Madonnatolda crowd of rapturous fans that she has “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”  However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel. Although Jussie Smollett is a free man today, avoiding a lengthy prison term that would have been a certain fate for anyone else, there are signs of anger with the decision, even inside of the Democratic camp. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, for example, called the ruling, “a whitewash of justice.” At the same time, the Chicago Police Union, which invested a lot of manpower and money into solving the non-crime, iscallingfor a federal investigation of the incident. While the liberals seem to enjoy a sort of invincibility when it comes to some of their more bizarre antics, with no small help from a left-leaning media that supports their every stupid stunt, the tide may be slowly turning against them. In that sense, the liberals may possibly be saved from themselves. @Robert_Bridge Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"27 Mar, 2019",Washington told Ukraine to end probe into George Soros-funded group during 2016 US election – report,"An NGO co-funded by George Soros was spared prosecution in 2016 after the US urged Ukraine to drop a corruption probe targeting the group, the Hill reported, pointing to potential shenanigans during the US presidential election. Bankrolled by the Obama administration and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC) was under investigation as part of a larger probe by Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s Office into the misallocation of $4.4 million in US funds to fight corruption in the eastern European country. As the 2016 presidential race heated up back in the United States, the US Embassy in Kiev gave Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko“a list of people whom we should not prosecute”as part of the probe, the Hillreported. Ultimately, no action was taken against AntAC. Lutsenko told the paper that he believes the embassy wanted the probe nixed because it could have exposed the Democrats to a potential scandal during the 2016 election. A State Department official who spoke with the Hill said that while the request to nix the probe was unusual, Washington feared that AntAC was being targeted as retribution for the group’s advocacy for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. AntAC wasn’t just the benefactor of well-connected patrons – at the time it was also collaborating with FBI agents to uncover then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s business dealings in Ukraine. Manafort later became a high-profile target of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian collusion, and was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for tax fraud and other financial crimes. Lutsenko divulged in an interview with the Hill last week that he has opened an investigation into whether Ukrainian officials leaked financial records during the 2016 US presidential campaign in an effort to sway the election in favor of Hillary Clinton. While AntAC may have failed to help the FBI find the Russia collusion smoking gun, the group’s activities constitute yet another link between the anti-climactic Russiagate probe and Soros, a Democrat mega-donor who bet big on Hillary Clinton taking the White House in 2016. In 2017, the billionaire philanthropist siphoned money into a new group, the Democracy Integrity Project, which later partnered with Fusion GPS to create the now-infamous Steele dossier. Spokespersons for AntAC and the Soros umbrella group Open Society Foundations declined to comment on the Hill’s scoop. Ironically, the prosecutor general who had preceded Lutsenko, Viktor Shokin, resigned under pressure from Washington – which accused Shokin of corruption. Virtuous US officials continue to make similar demands of Ukraine’s justice system. Earlier this month, Washington urged the Ukrainian government to fire its special anti-corruption prosecutor, again over accusations of administrative abuse. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary’s FM: We didn’t get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People’s Party, the center-right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary’s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban. Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you’re always a very welcome guest on our show. Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation. SS: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news. So, the bloc of the centre-right parties in the European Parliament, the European People's Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz. Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May’s elections? PS: Look, because... Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the European Union as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that's why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs. And our position is a very strong anti-migration position, which is not shared by many. And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements. So that's why this is the core of the conflict. SS: That's where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre-right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you're saying it's much larger of a spectrum, not just centre-right, because we get an impression that it's a center-right bloc. Ok, so that makes sense. PS: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament. And if you, let's say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you. And we have to be honest, European People's Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP’s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be. SS: So, this suspension happened, took place. The head of your Prime Minister's office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP. What’s going on right now? PS: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People's Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high-ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz’s values, Fidesz’s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let's put it this way. And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP. SS: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn't take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote... PS: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself. SS: So that means, that if it wasn't voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? PS: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow… SS: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend… PS: Yeah. We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary. So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing. SS: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU’s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? PS: No-no-no. We shouldn't confuse the party issue with, let's say, institutional questions. The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so-called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so-called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the European Union, like a cash machine, you know, and don't take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult. Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country. So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies. So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair. SS: So you're saying the payouts are not under threat? PS: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well. So it's a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long-lasting debate or legal procedure. SS: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti-migrant policy that your country's leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we've all seen. Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban’s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban’s policy? PS: No, no definitely not. Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that's going to be the case in the future as well. And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him. A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don't want that to happen. So it's a debate with him, an open debate. He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him. And my question is, why shouldn't a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary. SS: Okay, so let's see how the forces could be re-arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values. That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro-EU, and now it's kind of siding with Italy against. Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right-wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? PS: Look, I don't think it's fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti-European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry. Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the European Union… SS: Integration, let’s put it this way. PS: Yeah, yeah, right. There's a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward. And there are definitely at least two different camps. One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels. We think it's a dead-end street. We think this is a bad concept. We think that this will not strengthen European Union. What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong. So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro-European position, as we think that the way towards a strong European Union leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage. We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong. So the debate is rather about that, and that's why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong European Union, but we think that… SS: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it's not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you're all part of European Union, you want to be part of European Union, but, like you said, there's definitely two camps. One is super pro-integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you’re pro-stronger state and a formal Brussels, let's put it this way. So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you've suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? PS: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there. We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we'll see how we go forward. But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti-immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro-migration body. And this is something that we don't like. SS: So you're leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news. You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU's border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation. This is a serious accusation... PS: These are facts, basically. SS: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? PS: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border. Let's look at the Internet, at what they have said. You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting. And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection. Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned. Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it's not a border protection unit. They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together. But protecting the entire border to the South of the European Union with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn't know what he or she speaks about. We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long. So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex. The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders. Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours. So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended. SS: Ok, so I'm going to play a little bit of devil's advocate, and I'm going to tell you what the opposite side is saying. The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they're saying it's ludicrous, and it's a conspiracy theory, and they're actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay. Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you're not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it's under threat? I just want to hear that. PS:Whether the borders are under threat? SS: Do you feel like you're not in control of your own border? PS:We are in control. That's why we have built the fence. That's why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there. But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis. A number of them. So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border. But, you know, it's really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together. We think it's a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together. No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states. SS:So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered... PS:Absolutely. SS:That's your country as well... PS:But this cannot be our country. It's physically excluded. SS:OK. But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary. PS:But that was not the case, because no one could physically… It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece. So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary - either Greece or Greece and Croatia. Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, - but we made it very clear, no way, we won’t receive any of them, - was that we registered them, and the Greek didn't. But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one. SS:Another thing - Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members’ domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal. Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? PS:Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament. Then we don't know the composition of that. We don't know the composition of the European Commission. So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens. Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the European Union, what we see is a huge set of double standards. Why? Take the example of Poland. The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system. Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made. They completed all of them from A to Z. And what European Commission has done was saying “oh, it's not enough, we continue the procedure” instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer. So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations. SS:So I want to talk a little about Hungary's stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that's something that your country speaks very strongly about. For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro-immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the European Union. If that happens, if the pro-immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? PS:No, absolutely not. That's not in question. SS:So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe's population was Muslim. And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim. I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far-fetched, no?... He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different. PS:Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti-anything. So we are not anti-Muslim. We are not anti-anything. We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe. And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent. You know, it's unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn't be the case. Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo-Christian heritage, with its Christian culture. And in this regard, I think it's very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours. Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II. I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate. SS:I know you don't like Frontex, but I'm still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years. What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? PS:You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the European Union, mostly in the Southern and Southern-Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move - thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe. I was in Jordan recently. The 1.3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom. Lebanon - the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there. The last time the Turkish President has complained about the European Union not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU-Turkey deal on migration. As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious. The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck. On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow. Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats - they'll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr. Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships. So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing. I mean, on the level of European Union, we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing. So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the European Union is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe. SS:Okay, I get your point. Now to a different topic - the Russian-led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters. Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans. What's the calculus behind it? What's the logic? PS:Look, now the situation started to change. So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them. We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute. IIB’s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter. Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing. There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days. So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary. Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be. You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension. So new and modern investments are happening in the country. We are looking for financial background. So IIB's involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us. SS:But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank. It's a normal, usual practice with this international institutions. But the Western commentators are saying that actually it's a great base for Russia's intelligence services to operate from. What do you say to that? PS:You know, I think I surprised these commentators, including the Hungarian opposition, when I ask them whether they know that five out of the nine owners of this bank are NATO member states. Period. SS:Thank you very much. It's been great pleasure talking to you. Good luck with everything. PS:Thank you for the invitation again. Good being here.

"24 Feb, 2019",Moscow refutes ‘fantasy’ report on ‘secret talks’ between Salvini & Russian deputy PM,"Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak has never met Italy’s Matteo Salvini in person, his spokesman said, denying a report on an alleged shady deal the two struck to fund Salvini’s Lega Party with Russian money. Kozak has never held any talks with Salvini, a spokesman of the Russian deputy government head, Ilya Dzhus, told journalists on Sunday. He referred to an“investigative piece”publishedby Italy’s L'Espresso weekly earlier this week, in which it claimed the Italian deputy prime minister secretly met his Russian colleague in Moscow to discuss the terms of a deal that would supposedly allow his right-wing Lega Party get a hefty sum of money from Russia ahead of the European elections. “The so-called ‘investigation’ by the Italian L'Espresso is based on some flimsy fantasies that do no credit to the media outlet,”Dzhus told journalists.“Kozak never had any personal contacts to Salvini, never held any official or 'secret' meetings with him,”he said. Kozak’s agenda does involve“bilateral economic cooperation with Italy, including that in the fields of energy and industry.” The controversial piece claims that Russia presumably sought to support Italy’s Eurosceptic Lega Party at the European parliamentary elections by giving it €3 million worth of money disguised as part of a deal between Russia’s oil giant Rosneft and Italy’s state-owned energy company Eni. Kiev summons Italy envoy after Salvini called Euromaidan a 'pseudo-revolution' sponsored from abroadhttps://t.co/OkY7aH3jpK The article by the popular Italian magazine mentions nothing about the original sources of its information, but instead says that the whole story is part of a forthcoming book written by a couple of its journalists, which seems to be targeting Lega. It also scarcely mentions Salvini and Kozak, but instead says that the deal was largely orchestrated by the Italian deputy prime minister’s former spokesman, Gianluca Savoini, who conveniently turns out to be thepresidentof the Lombardy-Russia cultural association. The photos that Giovanni Tizian and Stefano Vergine – the authors of the hit-piece – showed as the supposed proof of their claims also do not demonstrate anything particularly incriminating.  They picture the aftermath of a conference, which Salvini officially attended in Moscow, an outer view of a building where he reportedly met Kozak, and also show Savoini sitting at a table at Moscow’s Metropol Hotel’s restaurant – allegedly ahead of the“secret talks,”as the journalists spin it. Despite lack of any solid proof, the story quickly got reprinted by some media, such as theGuardianand theDaily Beast. The Italian journalists behind the investigation admitted that they do not really know if the deal was struck at all as they presumably finished their“investigation”before the end of the negotiations. Despite that the Daily Beast quoted them as saying:“The main Italian government force is supported by [the Russian President Vladimir ] Putin, the number one enemy of the EU.” While the Italian opposition lawmakers rushed to describe L'Espresso’s claims as“worrying,”Salvini’s office brushed off any such allegations outright by saying that they“are not commenting on fantasies.” Russia’s Rosneft, which was also mentioned in the hit-piece previously published by Italy’s La Stampa as well, demanded the journalists retract their claims.“All the information about Rosneft in this article is incorrect and is a lie aimed at damaging the business reputation of the company,”it said in a statement. It is not the first attempt to accuse Salvini of“colluding”with the Kremlin. Last year, the Italian deputy prime minister vehemently rejected similar accusationsmadeby controversial billionaire George Soros. An outspoken Italian politician, who repeatedly criticized anti-Russian sanctions andsupportedrecognizing Crimea’s reunification with Russia, said at that time that he“never received any lira, euro or ruble from Russia.”  If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"19 Feb, 2019",NATO’s Atlantic Council hijacks Munich conference with revisionist ‘principles’ declaration,"Taking over the annual Munich security conference, the Atlantic Council has come out with a declaration of principles that seeks to legitimize the rogue behavior of the West after the Cold War as a ‘rules-based’ world order. For almost three decades now, Washington and its numerous clients and allies have insisted they were only upholding a“rules-based international order”against those who seek to challenge it, be it“rogue states”such as North Korea and Iran or great powers such as Russia and China. In the process, this self-styled“international community”trampled actual rules and laws to sanction, bomb, invade, occupy and regime-change countries that stood in its way – while claiming to be acting in the interests of the peace, democracy and commerce. Back in 2007, Russian President VladimirPutin stood upat the Munich Security Conference in Germany and denounced this behavior, arguing that the US has“overstepped its national borders in every way,”imposing“economic, political, cultural and educational policies”on other nations while holding itself exempt from any rules and limitations. This past weekend, the Atlantic Council – a think-tank backed by the US, NATO and other allied governments – used the platform of the Munich conference to announce a“declaration of principles”that explicitly seeks to revise the international order along the very lines Putin criticized, essentially establishing its signatories as the judge, jury and executioner of international law as they write it. 🚨BREAKING NEWS: Former leading officials from democratic countries have come together to declare their intent to defend a rules-based order. Here is the full set of principles.#DefendDemocracy#ACDeclaration#MSC2019Read:https://t.co/JOy6l14nSnpic.twitter.com/GjFcp4nhcP In the words ofJohn Bellinger, one of the declaration’s authors, it was“loosely modeled on the Atlantic Charter,”the WWII-era document establishing the US-UK alliance. Yet the new document has far more in common with the goals of Germany, Italy and Japan in that it is explicitly revisionist, saying: We will seek to revise and strengthen the international system to reflect these principles and advance them on the basis of international law. Those undersigned are endorsing a“standing mechanism”that would track“compliance”with the principles outlined in the declaration and“urge our governments to act when these principles are violated.” Wasn’t that supposed to be the job of the United Nations? And how is it respectful of others’ freedom and sovereignty to impose values on them at gunpoint? The declaration creates more questions than it purports to answer. The seven-point platform pays lip service to“freedom and justice, democracy and self-determination, peace and security, free markets and equal opportunity.”It also demands of signatories to“support an open global economy.” Point Four somehow managed to advocate for private property and capitalism as well as welfare state and open borders, asserting the right to“own property, purchase goods and services, and invest in free and open markets”as well as“free and fair flow of trade and investment”– but also demanding of governments to“facilitate access to food, water, shelter, medical services, and educationfor their own citizens and others in need”(emphasis added). Point Five also talks about an“open and healthy planet”in vague terms that combine overarching global environmentalism and migration across only nominally controlled borders. The true gem is Point Six, the“right of assistance”that would require governments to“allow their citizens to receive assistance from others to advance these principles, including, in non-free societies, support to non-violent groups, political parties, and individuals aiming to foster democracy or human rights”but also the signatories to intervene“where governments or other actors are unwilling or unable to cease or remedy flagrant or systematic violations.” Who would define“non-free societies”? Why of course, the signatories of the Atlantic Council declaration! The commitment to peace and security in Point Three asks the signatories to“refrain from the use of force,except as just and necessary to advance these principles.”(emphasis added) The devil is in the details, as they say – in this case, in that qualifying clause. There is a massive amount of hypocrisy in the US and its allies advocating for free markets and open flow of goods and services, while being the world’s leading source of sanctions, blacklists and blockades against those who resist their demands. Likewise, the notion of initiating force in order to promote the values of this declaration is a total mockery of values advocated by the champions of modern democracy – though it might be easily recognizable to ancient Athenians, who demanded the surrender of Melos with the argument that“the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” Perhaps the most pernicious notion in the declaration, however, is that it expands the duty to uphold its values from governments to ""private entities and individuals where they are able.”It is not hard to see how this is a direct attempt to lend legitimacy to the legion of quasi-NGOs backed by Western governments and their“philanthropist”hitmen like George Soros. There is only one tiny little problem with this: it upends the entire international order based on the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which gave governments the monopoly on force within their territory. The preceding Thirty Years War had seen much of Europe devastated by a conflict that started as a dynastic dispute only to spiral into a religious war characterized by widespread massacres and atrocities committed by official militaries as much as militias and mercenaries. 🚨 We will defend our values, overcome past failures with new ideas, answer lies with truth, confront aggression with strength, and go forward with the confidence that our principles will prevail. Join us.#DefendDemocracyRead#ACDeclarationhere:https://t.co/JOy6l14nSnpic.twitter.com/GGFmbvCa6e Looking at the committee that drafted this declaration, it becomes clear why it seeks to legitimize the lawlessness of the post-Cold War behavior by the bombers of Yugoslavia, invaders of Iraq, and regime-changers of Libya. Among the co-chairs of the drafting commission are former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former George W. Bush national security advisor Stephen Hadley, uniting the neoliberals and neoconservatives around the idea of a US-led global hegemony. The list of former government officials who signed the declaration also reads as a who’s who of US empire boosters, from former NATO GenSec Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Denmark) to former foreign ministers Tzipi Livni (Israel), Radek Sikorski (Poland), and David Miliband and Malcolm Rifkind – Labour and Tory, respectively – of the UK. Other notable names include Munich Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger, former deputy FM of Germany, as well as former Australian FM Alexander Downer, best known for his 2016 role in claiming Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was somehow connected to the phantom“Trump-Russia collusion.” The world could do worse than to take their declarations with a large chunk of salt.

"13 Feb, 2019",Revolution is the new black: How Western money funds overthrow-your-government classes,"Everyone at this gathering in Yerevan is young, hip and determined, and they’re learning how to stage a revolution. RT Russian managed to get inside the protesters’ camp, funded by US cash, and see what is being taught. The CampСamp 2018 forum in Yerevan was sponsored by the Prague Civil Society Centre, an organization financed by the United States under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Section 254 of the Act allocated $250,000 for activities to“counter Russian influence”in 2018 and 2019. Capitol Hill lawmakers seem to believe that this“Russian influence”is a threat to all NATO’s actual and potential members, including Georgia, Moldova, Kosovo, Serbia, and Ukraine. The Yerevan gathering is proving that the State Department’s money is doing its job all right. Protest-lobbying spin doctors have been putting the money to ‘good use’ dragging more and more people into their skillfully woven web. And it’s no coincidence Armenia was chosen to host the camp. After large-scale protests forced Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan to resign, protesters from all over the Commonwealth of Independent States started flocking to Yerevan for more inspiration.  A total of 150 people participated in the forum; most were sponsored by the organizers from Prague. Local participants were hailed as heroes, and visiting young men and women from other ex-Soviet republics got their own injection of inspiration from their triumph. If Armenia could, they can, too. The focus in CampCamp is on new technologies, on all things young and hip. “Fighting the authorities must be the cool thing to do, it must be trendy,”teaches Nikolay Artyomenko, head of the opposition Vremya (Time) movement from St. Petersburg. His portfolio is quite impressive. He put up banners on St. Isaac’s Cathedral protesting against the Orthodox Church taking over the museum. He ran a copy of the country’s constitution through a shredder, Banksy style, co-organized anti-corruption protests with rubber ducks; distributed“Dictator”prints where Putin was depicted like Obama in his“Hope”posters. Nikolay teaches others to be creative and invent new ways to protest that should take over the old-school crowd with picket signs format. “You have to stretch your imagination; there’s quite a problem on the protesting market these days. Protesting has become very expensive”,he shares. But Zhenya, an activist from Siberia, knows how to cut costs. He just turned 18, yet he has already risen to stardom on the activist scene: his one-man protests have made front-page headlines in his city more than once. Each of Zhenya’s demonstrations is like a theatrical performance. He carefully selects props and plans according to the country’s Administrative Penal Code:“You have to make sure you violate different laws to avoid being double-fined.” He’s locked in a long debate with Sasha from St. Petersburg about what kind of a public protest will get the smallest fine, and how to cut the“expenses”. Sasha is the more experienced of the two: he is already a law student and knows how to protest with minimal charges. This is yet another important factor in making protesting popular. Protests should not be seen as something heroic that one pays too high a price for. Just slap a poster on a wall here and there, upload a stinging meme or at most join a protesting crowd, take a selfie in the police van, pay your fine and go home. In today’s world of social media, absolutely anyone can be a reporter, an expert, a critic or a TV journalist – so why not be a revolutionary? “It is easy to get a grant; you can spend a month in the Czech Republic or work at Radio Free Europe or some think tank”,Michael Zolyan tells Polina from Omsk. Michael is“the frontman of the Velvet Revolution”,according to the organizers. By coincidence, he is also a Prague Civil Society Centre expert. The CampCamp 2018’s most active group is the one from Kyrgyzstan. It’s a crowd of young journalists led by Bektour Iskender, founder of opposition web portal Кloop.kg. Bektour sees no harm that this“festival of democracy”is sponsored by foreign money. During the break, he confirms that his project is financed by the Prague Civil Society Centre. “They treat me as an equal. They don’t try to be my boss, and I’m good with it”,he says. Bektour’s workshop is called“How to fight things you hate doing what you like”.It looks like he has honed his skills to perfection and is quite happy doing journalism in Kyrgyzstan with US funding. The workshop starts off very much like one of those self-esteem web courses where you have to write a list of things you don’t like about yourself; only instead of“I’m overweight”or“I’m single”you write down things that are wrong with your country, like“corruption,”or“totalitarianism,”or“Putin,”or“fake news,”or“no respect for children.”Masha, a student from Odessa seems to be unable to figure out what to write under“What do you hate most?”Instead of”corruption”she finally settles on“sloppy eaters.” Step number two: think of a solution to the problem you’ve indicated using something you enjoy doing. Zhenya from Siberia and Boris from Dushanbe spend the next 15 minutes thinking of how they can overthrow the government while“sky gazing in the trees.”Sounds downright comical, but the guys admit freely that they don’t mind using falsification and manipulation for the right cause, if necessary. “We can spread a rumor that the authorities are going to cut down trees”,they begin. The audience cheers them on.“Sure, that’s not true, but if we scare enough people, if we make them believe they are about to lose something good, that might help make them more active and start asking the government questions.” Artist Dasha Sozanovich goes on to explain in her workshop how to use cool visuals for protest purposes. “Pictures work for both good and evil,”she says.“The Islamic State’s (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) visual campaign is an example of how pictures served evil.” Dasha’s own project called“Khabarstan”is, on the other hand, an example of how pictures serve the“good guys.”Her presentation makes Kazakhstan funding state TV channels much more exciting. Dasha points out that it was the Prague Civil Society Centre that united all those who collaborated on this project. Переддень#Halloweenзапустили#Хабарстан.https://t.co/hHDeJys8dgno poka da.pic.twitter.com/PNTO5JisMq Dasha’s pictures do their best to help the viewers understand that spending state money on media is very wrong. No one mentions though that her time, meals, travel and lodging expenses have been fully covered from the state budget of the United States of America. Two young artists are working away on their whiteboards creating stylish animations of the presentations they see, instead of taking notes the traditional way. That looks very cool, too. “I decided to be an activist 11 years ago. It all started at a police station.”That’s a comic strip, where one of the artists captured the essence of what another star of the Armenian Revolution David Sansaryan was saying. One more piece of advice young activists get here is that they should focus on social media, like Russian social networks OK.ru and VK.ru, as well as Facebook, since they can’t really compete with real media. The main goal is to elicit a response, get people to repost and comment on their publications. “It’s like something out of this world for us,”says a girl from Kazakhstan. There are also young people from Russia and Belarus here,“dreaming to repeat Yerevan’s success.”Vanya from Perm confesses to the supportive audience that he came here to“export the revolution.”That’s exactly what our“friends”from Prague, Europe’s partisans of democracy are going to be teaching them all four days of the forum. However, the excitement he created gets killed by a word of reason from head organizer Maria Sereda. She reminds all those present about security and requests them to refrain from tweeting this catchy slogan,“or we’ll have Russian cameras all over the place in no time.” The forum also offers a handful of workshops on techniques that can be used to increase protest sentiment in society. One workshop uses the theme of Russian folk tales. In one of the cases, a“forest community”learns to interact with the government, i.e. the“Big Bad Wolf.”Speaking of overthrowing the“Big Bad Wolf of Belarus,”the head organizer says that there is only one to do it — to let the little critters’ anger grow over the years. “You’ll have to let the little critters’ anger grow till you impeach the Big Bad Wolf,”Maria Sereda says cheerfully.“This case will work great for Belarus. And it has already worked for Ukraine!” She continues to tell the audience about different anti-government strategies and mentions a number of organizations that have been successful in implementing them, including the International Crisis Group, co-founded by George Soros, and Amnesty International. “They work quietly and softy”,Ms Sereda says.“They settle issues with the local governments very delicately.” One more thing young activists are being taught here is how to identify the target audience. They need to aim for people who are most sensitive to liberal values propaganda. Those who do not mix with other activists and don’t attend protests are called a waste of time. It’s clear what kind of people are being talked about: if a person supports or is just neutral to Crimea rejoining Russia, they are not worth the effort. The main target audience is defined as large city residents aged 20 to 40 with a university degree and mid-range income. The speaker believes this segment has the most potential. “You need to see who you’re talking to. Is that a loaded person with a reputation and power, or just someone who is so angry they might actually do something?”the speaker continues. Overall, СampСamp is very reminiscent of school summer camps: fun activities by the day and get-togethers“by the fire”with a potluck in the evenings.“The most experienced revolutionaries”(from Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, both“as stagnating as Russia”) have the best food. Many participants have met before, at the Boris Nemtsov Summer School in Prague. The“camp leaders”also know each other well. The more experienced participants are very friendly to all newcomers.

"12 Feb, 2019",Euroskeptics aim to paralyze EU and they love Russia! – Think tank creates alarm ahead of EU polls,"With the approach of the May elections to the EU Parliament, a pro-EU think tank has sounded an alarm over the burgeoning Euroskeptics, expected to take some 30 percent of seats. Naturally, Russia ""highly likely"" has a hand in it. The alarmistreportis published by The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) – a pro-EU non-profit think tank. The ECFR was established in 2007 and relies primarily on""donations""from various organizations – including such purveyors of a globalist agenda as George Soros' Open Society Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Needless to say, the report paints a very dim picture of a European future if Euroskeptics manage to secure the expected 28 –or even 30– percent of seats in the EU Parliament in the May elections, as opinion polls indicate. According to the report, Euroskeptic parties from all across Europe – both left- and right-wing – are bent on""paralyzing""the bloc. ""Their ability to paralyze decision-making at the centre of the EU would defuse pro-Europeans' argument that the project is imperfect but capable of reform. At this point, the EU would be living on borrowed time,""the report warns. The upcoming elections are described in terms like""battle of ideas,""""fight"" and so on. It's pointed out, however, that the EP is""only one of the European Union's governing bodies and, in many ways, the least powerful of them."" At the same time, the think tank urges readers not to underestimate the importance of the elections, which could""have a very high cost for liberal internationalists,""stressing that a high turnout is key for pushing the Euroskeptics back. It also provides a list of tips on what to tell people to encourage them to go to the polls, warning that a""defensive""stance is not sufficient. Rather than simply fight defensively on the issues that anti-Europeans favour, pro-European forces should be creative in constructing an image of a reinvigorated, hopeful European project. Apart from general concerns about the alleged desire of assorted Euroskeptics to""dismantle the rule of law,""disrupt setting unified environmental regulations and conduct an overall attack on""European values,""the""anti-Europeans""are, in general, friendly towards Russia, the report warns. Which means that Moscow will, of course, try to meddle with the elections to help them. To back up the warning, the report cites alleged – but unproven – Russian meddling in other elections, and uses the tried and trusted""highly likely""formula. ""Given the Russian interference in recent national elections in Europe, and the tension in EU-Russian relations arising from hostilities in the Sea of Azov in November 2018, it is highly likely that Moscow will attempt to manipulate the EP vote,""the report claims. At the same time, the think tank acknowledges that the Euroskeptics are very far from being a united force and often have polarized views on various issues. They still, however, might get some common cause – with their supposed""love for Russia""being the main one, naturally. ""Love of Russia, hatred of sanctions, and strong protectionist inclinations can unite the far left and the far right. Nonetheless, it is still more common for them to take different approaches,""the report states. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"25 Jan, 2019",Roger Stone arrest is FBI ‘optics’,"RT’s Caleb Maupin reports on criticism that Trump associate Roger Stone was inappropriately arrested in front of news cameras, which calls into question possible collusion with the media.

Investigative journalist Ben Swann talks about that with RT America’s Manila Chan.

Former Pentagon official Michael Maloof explains to RT America’s Manila Chan that a US meeting in Doha with the Taliban means the United States may exit, but that withdrawal  would prompt the immediate fall of Afghanistan’s government.

"25 Jan, 2019",‘US should look for its problems at home’ – Russian minister on Soros rant about ‘dangerous’ China,"Washington should focus on actually fixing its domestic problems instead of searching for external enemies to blame them on, Russia's Minister for Economic Development Maksim Oreshkin said. The remarks were in response to the words of liberal billionaire George Soros, who lashed out at China speaking at the Davos economic forum in Switzerland. “China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced,”Soros said.“This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies.” China brushed off the comments, saying that“statements by certain people, which portray black as white and distort facts, are completely pointless and not worthy of even a rebuttal.”Aside from Beijing, Soros has also expressed similar concerns about Russia. According to Oreshkin, the US should stop trying to blame the troubles of“open societies”on someone else, but look for the root of its problems at home. “Look at what is happening in America. Over the past 30 years real income of the middle class and below haven't grown almost at all. The expenses for healthcare and education have risen trifold, even taking inflation in account,”Oreshkin told RT during a press conference in Davos.“Naturally, it has led to the growth of dissent in America, becoming one of the factors in Donald Trump, with all his peculiar rhetoric, becoming the president.” The problems are within the US. An external enemy, which impedes them and causes all the trouble in the US – whether Russia or China – is just substitution of concepts. The official warned that such an approach – expressed by Soros and other figures of the US elite – sows nothing but confrontation, which ultimately harms the US itself end impedes economic growth worldwide.  “Until every country realizes that the problems exist, above all, in themselves and not in some external forces, such mindset will persist and we'll continue to hear such statements,”Oreshkin added.

"25 Jan, 2019","Soros calls Xi ‘the worst enemy of free societies,’ China says it’s not even worth a response","Liberal billionaire and renowned political meddler George Soros has labeled Chinese leader Xi Jinping ‘the most dangerous opponent of open societies.’ China says it’s a gross distortion not even worthy of a rebuttal. Speaking at the Davos economic forum in Switzerland, Soros attacked China’s “social credit” system and technological advances, saying artificial intelligence and machine learning, put“in the hands of repressive regimes,”are a“mortal danger facing open societies.” “China isn’t the only authoritarian regime in the world, but it’s undoubtedly the wealthiest, strongest and most-developed in machine learning and artificial intelligence,”said Soros, known for using his money to organize and support movements against the governments he deems oppressive. The“main source of hope”against Xi are the Chinese people, whose aspirations, according to Soros, are sharply distinct from the regime’s. Beijing brushed off Soros’ attack. “It’s obvious who is opening doors and building roads and who is closing doors and building walls. Statements by certain people, which portray black as white and distort facts, are completely pointless and not worthy of even a rebuttal,”said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. “We hope the relevant American can correct his attitude, not be shortsighted, and hold an objective, rational and correct opinion of China’s development,”Hua added. Hedge fund billionaire Soros runs the Open Society Foundations (OSF), a vast grant-giving network with the stated goal of making governments open to participation and accountable to the people. Soros’ controversial political ventures include attacks against US President Donald Trump, donating to campaignspromotinga second Brexit referendum in the UK, and helping along the Ukrainian revolutions in both 2004 and 2014,among others. This has earned him the adoration of liberals around the globe and got the OSF banned in Hungary and Turkey. It’s also on the list of “undesirable” organizations in Russia. Trump and his supporters have accused the billionaire of funding protests against the US president – accusations that have been branded conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic. Soros, the Financial Times “person of the year” for 2018, is also at odds with Facebook and Google. He called the tech giants a“menace”during his Davos speech last year.

"8 Jan, 2019","In Western media, publishing fake news about Russia is a good career move… with no consequences","Fighting ""Russian disinformation"" in the West has become a lucrative business. But, in reality, you're far more likely to encounter deceitful agitprop directed at Russia. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv MOSCOW – CP Scott remains a towering figure in the annals of British journalism. Editor of the then ""Manchester Guardian"" for an astonishing 57 years, he celebrated his paper's centenary by laying down a set of legendary principles. ""Comment is free, but facts are sacred,"" Scott intoned in the missive. Sadly, almost a hundred years later, facts are free and the right to spread disinformation is becoming sacred, as far as his successors are concerned. Particularly when it comes to coverage of Russia. Yet another example came over the New Year break. Following a few weeks out of the spotlight after peddling an obviously fake story about Julian Assange/Paul Manafort meetings in London, Luke Harding reappeared. And he came armed with his particular brand of bulls*** and sloppiness. A sensationalistinterviewwith former Soviet spy 'Viktor Suvorov' was full of fragile fact-checking and downright stupidity. For instance, presenting a pensioner, who defected from a different country almost 40 years ago, as an authority on how Vladimir Putin's Kremlin operates today stretched credulity. And the piece was also riddled with factual errors, to boot. For instance, Harding claimed Suvorov's 1980's book ""Icebreaker"" now ""has broad acceptance among historians;"" a tome which insists ""Stalin had been secretly plotting an offensive against Hitler's Germany"" but first he ""wanted Hitler to destroy democracy in Europe, in the manner of an icebreaker, thereby clearing the way for world communism."" In other words, not the version you learned at school. Except, surprise, surprise, this statement on Suvorov's book isn't true. As one scholarpointed out, while demanding a correction from Harding, it's more accurate to say the opposite is the case. Indeed, the scholarreferenced, ""Suvorov's argument was rapidly countered by much of the established Russian historical community,"" including Dmitry Volkogonov, ""with the support of Western historians."" We've been here before with Harding. He's repeatedly weaved fantastical stories about Russia, and other subjects, for years. But, as the legendary ex-Moscow hack Mark Amesobserves""literally nothing Harding publishes, no matter how demonstrably false and reckless, will ever hurt his journalism career. He's a Made Man."" Guardian hack Luke Harding was caught plagiarizing me,@yashalevine& others—and it had zero effect on his career advancement. If his latest “scoop” on Manafort/Assange is debunked, there will be zero consequences. Most of us still can’t fully grasp thishttps://t.co/8AeD8GRXh0 And, while he's an especially blatant example, Harding is not alone in this. Because on the Russia beat, it seems Western journalists can pretty much get away with any transgressions, without suffering career damage. Instead, paradoxically, it often seems to even lead to professional progression. Today, you hear a lot of hysteria concerning ""Russian disinformation"" in the West, but little or nothing, in mainstream media, on ""disinformation about Russia,"" something this writer has tried to cover in recent years. And it's a lonely beat. Indeed, as the Canadian academic Paul Robinson rightly notes, while ""there's a huge army of well-funded institutions and individuals now devoted to uncovering and countering 'Russian disinformation,' there seems to be little or no accountability for the false stories produced by Western sources (on Russia)."" And the examples are legion. With even the most heinous fakes failing to amount to any sort of setback for their promoters. Which suggests editors are more than happy to indulge the practice, because after all it's only Russia and everyone knows Russia is ""bad."" Here are a few selected lowlights… Numerous other examples exist but more are hardly needed to show how there seems to be no penalty for getting Russia wrong in Western media. And, on the contrary, it's hardly a conspiracy theory to suggest it's actively encouraged. Which means, of course, disinformation about Russia is far more common, organized and influential than notional ""Russian disinformation."" Particularly on social networks, but prevalent too in supposedly ""respectable"" media. READ MORE: The only ‘Russian bots’ to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat-linked ‘experts’ Nevertheless, don't hold your breath waiting for the usual think tank ""info war"" chancers to issue reports, dripping with condemnation.

Eyebrows were raised over the not-at-all biased description of the billionaire as a champion of democracy. For thirty years, liberal businessman and philanthropist Soros has used his vast wealth to crusade against""authoritarianism, racism and intolerance,""the FT profilereads.

There's hardly a question over whether the Soros-funded apparatus is doing the right thing.

""We haven't stopped having a beneficial influence,""Soros is then quoted as saying.

More and more detractors see his work as an existential threat to conservative values and even state sovereignty.

"18 Dec, 2018",Russia passes law to tackle foreign meddling in its elections,"The Russian parliament has passed a law which says foreign organizations meddling in any kind of election in Russia may be declared ‘undesirable’ and ousted from the country. Election observers are exempt. The law, passed on Tuesday, will make a small amendment to the legislation which regulates how a non-governmental organization (NGO) may be barred from operating in Russia. The current rules say Russia may oust an NGO, which is considered a threat to Russia’s“constitutional order, defense or security”. The new piece of legislation, once signed into law, would clarify that such a threat may be posed by meddling in elections in Russia. The meddling is defined as promoting or obstructing candidates or issues for a referendum or affecting the outcome of a ballot, but does not include the activities or registered international observers monitoring the campaign. Russia made the political activities of an NGO a valid reason for their removal in 2015. The decision to declare an organization ‘undesirable’ is taken by the general prosecutor or one of his or her deputies after consultations with the Foreign Ministry. An NGO targeted in this way has to shut down its offices in Russia, is barred from financial services and cannot legally publish its materials for Russian audiences. The list of organizations ousted from Russia under these rules includes US soft power peddlers like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute as well as George Soros’ Open Society Foundation. Russian citizens and organizations acting on behalf of a banned foreign NGO may be fined. Repeat offenders face communal service and even prison terms of up to 6 years and a ban from holding a public office. But those who part ways with the NGO voluntarily get a pass and don’t face criminal charges. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"16 Nov, 2018",‘In-house fake news shop’ – Facebook facing new scandal and losing friends,"A new report has exposed glaring hypocrisy in Facebook’s attitude to fake news. Can CEO Mark Zuckerberg weather yet another scandal? An explosive New York Timesreport, published Wednesday, revealed that Facebook employed a PR firm to smear critics and publish hit-pieces on rival tech companies Apple and Google. These pieces were published on NTKNetwork.com, a site run by the firm that masqueraded as a real news site.NBCjumped on board the story, with a former employee of the firm calling NTKNetwork“our in-house fake news shop.” Facebook claimed in response that the report was fake news. The companystatedthat it never asked the firm – a Washington DC-based company called Definers – to write articles or spread misinformation. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he was unaware of Facebook’s relationship with Definers, despite the fact that the company’s statement said that relationship was“well known by the media.” READ MORE: Facebook hired PR firm to label its critics ‘agents of Soros’ Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also denied knowledge of Definers’ relationship with Facebook. “We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news,”she told CBS News on Friday.“And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false.” So who’s faking it? The Times’ revelations sparked a flurry of discussion on social media, with the court of public opinion weighing in against Facebook. So Facebook contracted with a company that was literally writing fake news. By which I mean, ""stories"" that pretended to be from a news org but were in fact from a corporate PR/propaganda shop.https://t.co/jxG3YQX4rkpic.twitter.com/cryDO0KTnr It really is special that in pushing back against criticism of its Russia / fake news problems, Facebook paid for posts on a pretend news website run by lobbyists that is indistinguishable from one of those garbage FB fake news sitespic.twitter.com/dFpL8ojAfn Facebook hired a private lobby firm to create fake news and start antisemitic rumours about its critics. I have also personally been the target of Facebook’s PR operation - and trust me - they are dirty.https://t.co/xSUC7KI4zt FB execs seem trustworthy & absolutely have no history of being purposefully dishonest to cover their butts regarding the results of bad risks they've taken in the name of profits. I'm totally going to believe them this time.(Note: in case it wasn't entirely clear, /sarcasm.) Ironically, this latest scandal stems from Facebook’s attempts to cover up an earlier scandal: the Cambridge Analytica breach. First revealed in March, the Cambridge Analytica scandal saw some 87 million Facebook users have their private data leaked to third party marketers. The revelation was followed by months of additional privacy scandals that saw Facebook’s stock take a hammering and Zuckerberg hauled before multiple Congressional committees to explain himself. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing in July, protesters held up signs depicting Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg as giant octopuses, with their tentacles encircling the globe. Facebook complained to the Anti-Defamation League, who called the posters“a classic anti-Semitic trope.” Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope. Protest Facebook -- or anyone -- all you want, but pick a different image.https://t.co/9vvwygloWo Crying anti-Semitism in public, Facebook was preparing behind the scenes to meet the protesters on their own level. The company instructed Definers to circulate material linking some anti-Facebook activists to billionaire liberal financier George Soros, himself a vocal critic of the social media giant. While at least one anti-Facebook group, Color of Change, does, in fact, take money from Soros, commentators were quick to call Facebook out. First, for insinuating that a wealthy Jewish donor was controlling its opposition, and secondly for the hypocrisy of accusing that same opposition of anti-Semitism at the same time. This article about the inner workings of Facebook is a vicious account of Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s dirty dealings. They at once cried anti-semitism while simultaneously blaming troubles on George Soros.https://t.co/WowPX35feZ Facebook is an impressive company. They both went after our coalition group@FacebookBreakupas Soros-funded AND worked with the Anti-Defamation League to accuse us of anti-semitism.https://t.co/MGZLJZO6hv With the left now as rankled as the right, can Zuckerberg weather this storm? The 34-year-old CEO doesn’t have many friends left. Facebook has been roundly excoriated by the right in America, who have long complained about the social network’s apparent liberalbias, burgeoning monopoly status, andcensorshipof conservative content. However, Facebook has also clamped down on leftist discussion as of late: abruptly removing orcensoringcontent from several left-wing news and discussion pages. The censorship was cranked up a notch in October, when Facebook took the unprecedented step of removing 800 alternative newspagesahead of November’s midterm elections. The pages hit spanned the political spectrum, from left-leaning organizations like The Anti Media, to flag-waving opinion sites like Right Wing News and Nation in Distress. Other pages banned included those belonging to police brutality watchdog groups Filming Cops and Policing the Police. Even RT America’s Rachel Blevins found her own page banned for posts that were allegedly“misleading users.” Facebook took down my page with nearly 70,000 followers, labeling it as ""spam,"" when I have spent 4 years working to build that page up and using it to post the articles I wrote and videos of my reporting. This is so incredibly wrong and is affecting hundreds of similar pages. So Zuckerberg can kiss goodbye to support from the political fringes, but what about the mainstream left? Well, in a New York Times op-ed published Friday, columnist Michelle Goldberg called for Facebook a“ruthless monopoly”that should be forcibly broken up with antitrust legislation – as happened to America’s ‘robber baron’ industrialists in the early 20th Century. Significantly, calls for antitrust action against Facebook have, until now, come from Republicans. President Trump himself reportedly weighed antitrust action against tech monopolies in September, warning Google and Facebook that they were treading on“very, very troubled territory.” Since 2016, Zuckerberg has shared one unbreakable bond with American liberals: a willingness to blame Russia. To that end, Facebook announced plans to use artificial intelligence to weed out content it deems harmful to election security;partneredup with an aggressively anti-Russia think tank to fight dangerous narratives; and went as far asbuildinga physical“war room”to combat“foreign interference”in real time during this month’s midterm elections. But its report, or rather blogposton ‘Russian interference’ was criticized for revealing little. In it, Facebook said that ‘Russian agents’ had spent a paltry $100,000 on political ads, the majority of which“didn’t specifically reference the US presidential election, voting or a particular candidate.”The ads, Facebook concluded, were ineffective, completely legal, and relatively inconsequential. The New York Times alleges that Facebook didn’t go far enough in its anti-Russia activities. Citing one of its ownreportsas an example, the Times argued that Facebook’s blog post barely scratched the surface of the ‘Russian conspiracy.’ Losing support from the right and the left, Zuckerberg looks set to face down the incoming PR nightmare with fewer friends than before. With Soros reportedlycallingon Facebook to undertake an audit of its own lobbying and PR work, the stage is once again set for another public examination of the world’s largest social network. And with Facebook investors alreadyunhappywith Zuckerberg’s leadership, the 34-year-old CEO could stand to make a dramatic fall. Graham Dockery  Think your friends would be interested?

"9 Nov, 2018",Editor-in-chief of anti-Kremlin online news site resigns amid sexual harassment scandal,"The editor-in-chief of foreign-funded Russian website Meduza has resigned over a sexual harassment scandal. The man allegedly groped a colleague’s wife at a drunken party and told her he would easily get away with it. The incident occurred on October 20 when Meduza journalists were celebrating the fourth birthday of their outlet. It was apparently a wild party, with a lot of booze involved, at the Meduza headquarters in the Latvian capital, Riga. At one point, the editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov, allegedly approached the wife of one of his colleagues and grabbed her bottom. The victim laterrecalledthat the heavily intoxicated man explained his actions by saying:“You’re the only one at this party who I can harass and get away with it.” The woman’s husband told Meduza’s editorial board about Kolpakov’s behavior and said he would quit if the man kept his position as editor-in-chief. He eventually carried out his ultimatum and filed for voluntary leave, despite the outlet trying to persuade him to stay or switch to working remotely. As for Kolpakov, who was one of Meduza’s co-founders and became editor-in-chief in 2016, the board looked into the scandal and suspended him for two weeks. But when that term expired, the bosses ruled that the improper conduct by the editor-in-chief wasn’t systematic and he could return to work. But on Friday, shortly after reuniting with his colleagues at the office, Kolpakov announced that he decided to resign. However, it wasn’t guilt, but other motives that drove him. “I categorically refuse to acknowledge accusations of harassment and sexual abuse. But I’ve found myself in the situation when it’s impossible and pointless to defend myself,”he tweeted. “I’m leaving because it pains me to see how you are destroying what I’ve been building. Because I despise injustice. Because not everything that’s broken should be fixed.” Meduza was established in 2014 by a group of Russian journalists who quit prominent news website Lenta.ru after what they claimed was the politically-motivated firing of its editor-in-chief, Galina Timchenko. Back then, Timchenko explained that the new outlet was registered in Latvia because it was“impossible”to organize independent news coverage in Russia. Former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in prison on fraud and tax evasion charges, was considering sponsoring the website, but the partnership didn’t happen. Producing content critical of Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin, Meduza quickly became the go-to site for those with opposition views in Russia. In September, it waseighthin terms of citation ratings among Russian-language online news publications. Earlier this year,researchby RT revealed that Meduza relies on foreign funding to carry out its operations. Analysis of the outlet’s financial statements from 2017 indicated that the website received money transfers from the OAK Foundation and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. These NGOs previously cooperated with billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundation, which was banned in Russia in 2015 as“a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system… and the security of the state.” READ MORE: MPs to be sacked for sexual misconduct as 1 in 5 Westminster workers experience harassment Russian MPs said the facts uncovered by RT were sufficient for Meduza to be registered as a ‘foreign agent’ in Russia, but the website still operates without restrictions in the country.

"9 Nov, 2018",Dirty little secret: ‘Think tanks’ are among top culprits in media disinformation crisis,"Most consumers are unaware off the mainstream media’s dirty little secret. Think tanks are increasingly taking advantage of tight news budgets to influence the press agenda in favour of their sponsors. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Decades ago, these outfits generally operated as policy advisories. Although, some were comfortably enumerated ‘retirement homes’ for distinguished public servants or intellectuals. However, in modern times, they have become indistinguishable from lobbying firms. With the budgets to match. On the Russia (and broader Eastern European) beat, think tank influence is becoming increasingly dangerous and malign. And it’s leading to a crisis in journalistic standards which nobody wants to acknowledge. Two cases this week highlight the malaise. Right now, Hungary and Ukraine are embroiled in a standoff regarding the rights of ethnic Hungarians in the latter country. The disagreement is entirely local, with roots in the 20th century carving-up of Budapest’s territory after it found itself on the losing side in both World Wars. As a result, lands were dispersed into other nations – former Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. There are tensions, to varying degrees, between Hungary and pretty much all the successor states housing its lost diaspora. Especially since nationalist Viktor Orban started handing out passports to compatriots stranded on foreign soil. Until recently, most of the focus was on disagreements with Slovakia, but now attention has switched to Ukraine. Let’s be clear. This is a mess of Kiev’s making. In a bid to appease“patriotic”fundamentalists, it began moves towards restrictive language laws, which has especially alienated the small band of Hungarian speakers on its western frontier. Predictably, Budapest rushed in to defend its“people,”and now we have a nasty little imbroglio with headbangers on both sides entrenched. One thing it’s not about is Russia. But Western media, egged on by think tank“experts,”keeps banging this drum. And here is a case in point this week. The Los AngelesTimessent a correspondent to Uzhgorod, a Ukrainian border city. And rather than merely report from the ground, the writer spends a huge amount of the article referring to Russia and intimating that Orban is operating in lock-step with Moscow. Which is laughable to anybody who understands the Hungarian PM’s political methods. And which reeks of disinformation. And who is used to“back up”these assertions? Only one Peter Kreko,“director of the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank,”who is concerned Orban’s moves“help Russia hamper Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration.” Now, isn’t that a weird sort of thing for a Hungarian analyst to be worrying about? Well, it wouldn’t be if the LA Times were transparent and disclosed Kreko’s funding. You see, here’s who bankrolls the“Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank.” Institute of Modern Russia (plaything of disgraced former 90’s oligarch and Putin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky) National Endowment For Democracy (a US neoconservative outlet dedicated to“regime change”and promoting a pro-US outlook in Eastern Europe, whose chair has dubbed Ukraine“the big prize”) Open Society (George Soros, who needs no introduction) And here are some of the“most important international and domestic professional partners”of the Political Capital Institute: Atlantic Council (NATO’s propaganda wing) European Values (a Soros-funded Prague lobby group which smeared hundreds of European public figures as“useful idiots”for appearing on RT. Including Jeremy Corbyn and Stephen Fry). German Marshall Fund of the United States (proprietors of the infamous ‘Hamilton 68’ dashboard) Thus, the agendas at play are pretty clear here. Yet, the LA Times keeps its readers ignorant of Kreko’s paymasters. Which is especially interesting when you see RT, almost always, referred to as“the Kremlin-funded Russia Today,”or some version thereof, when described in Western media. And this is fine, because it’s true, but when the same rules don’t apply across the board, the bias is obvious. The second case comes courtesy of“the Rupert Murdoch controlled Times of London”(see what I did there?) This week, it alleged around75,000Russians in London alone are Kremlin informants. All based on an“investigation”by the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a neoconservative pressure group which seems to have successfully mounted a reverse takeover of the once venerable paper. With its leader writer, for instance, being a founding signatory of theconcern. Anyway, HJS, apparently based on a mere 16 interviews, with unnamed sources, concluded that“between a quarter and a half of Russian expats were, or have been informants.”And the Times splashed it. However, it“clarified,”with comment from an anonymous“dissident,”how, in reality,“it was about half.”So, only the 32,500 odd ‘agents’ in London then. Which, if true, would means the walls of the Russian Embassy would have to be made from elastic to house the amount of handlers required to keep tabs on their information sources. Look, it’s hardly a secret that standards at the Times are low. After all, the main foreign affairs columnist, Edward Lucas, is literally funded by US weaponsmanufacturers. No, this is not a joke. Lucas is employed as a lobbyist at CEPA, a Washington and Warsaw-based outfit, which promotes the arms manufacturer's agenda in Central and Eastern Europe. Namely, thelikesof Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, FireEye, and Bell Helicopters. Of course, The Times doesn’t make this conflict of interests clear to its readers.

"4 Nov, 2018",It’s not Russia that’s damaging American democracy – it’s money,"It is estimated that over $5.2 billion will be spent on the US midterm elections and it’s no secret that hundreds of millions of those dollars are supplied by billionaire donors. This system is incompatible with real democracy. is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin. Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others. Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin. Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others. Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ In a piece for The Guardian last week, Chuck Collinswrotethat the three wealthiest families in the US — the Waltons of Walmart, the Mars candy family and the Koch brothers — own a combined fortune of $348.7 billion — a sum which is 4 million times the median wealth of a normal American family. Arecent studyconducted by researchers at Northwestern University found that despite the popular narrative of the so-called ‘philanthropic’ liberal billionaire in the style of Bill Gates, most of these super rich mega-donors are“extremely conservative”in their political views. They believe in cutting taxes for the rich and abolishing the estate tax. They are opposed to banking and environmental regulation — and they aren’t overly enthusiastic about social programs upon which millions of Americans rely. Instead of being loud and proud about these views, however, they practice what the study authors called“stealth politics”— in other words, they rarely speak publicly on politics, but spend massive amounts of money lobbying politicians on the quiet. This is not to imply that conservative billionaire donors are bad and liberal billionaires donors are good, which is what mainstream liberal media would seemingly like us to believe when they promote the likes of George Soros as a paragon of goodness while lamenting the influence of the Koch brothers. It is, however, a simple fact that America’s wealthiest billionaires areoverwhelmingly conservative— and very rarely are they interested in creating a society that is fairer and better serves the average working American. But, regardless of the politics of those doling out the dosh, this is a rotten and corrupt system of legalized bribery and one that is completely incompatible with true democracy. How could it be? Politicians are beholden not to the people, but to wealthy donors and special interests. Don’t just take it from me. Former congressman Mick Mulvaney, who is now the White House budget director, wasremarkably candidabout all this during a speech back in April. “We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.” Rich donors and lobbyists shovel obscene amounts of money into political campaigns knowing that politicians will serve their interests in Congress. Conservative billionaire Sheldon Adelson, for example, has funneled more than $100 million into the 2018 midterms. If you’re wondering why people like Adelson, who have billions in hoarded wealth, would even bother with elections the answer is simple: abject greed. As Collins wrote in the Guardian, they are“spending millions to save themselves billions”down the road. Meanwhile, normal Americans, despite how politically active they may be, have anear-zero impacton public policy. Yet, getting money out of politics and taking back control of their democracy does not seem to be as big a focus as it should be for most Americans. Instead, super-rich elites, aided by the mainstream media, have been massively successful in distracting the population with conveniently constructed narratives. For the Democrats, so-called Russian ‘collusion’ and ‘interference’ has acted as a successfuldistraction tacticsince Donald Trump was elected. For Republicans and Trump himself, over-the-top fear-mongering about immigration while ignoring its root causes (often destabilizing US foreign policy) has been a wonderful distraction tactic. READ MORE: #ICYMI: How to spot Russian interference in the US midterm elections (VIDEO) When Americans are talking non-stop about Russians and migrants coming to get them, they’re not focused on the fact that the political system in which they are operating is corrupt to the core and serves only a tiny minority of mega-rich citizens who reside in ivory towers. Actress Marsha Warfield summed it up perfectly in a tweet last week: “Why the hell are you mad at immigrants seeking a better life and not the tiny percentage of greedy f*cks hoarding the world's resources while we fight amongst ourselves for crumbs?” In 2016, about $6.5 billion was spent on presidential and congressional campaigns. That’s about enough to give every teacher a$2,000 pay rise. Aside from the many ways such money could clearly be put to better use, there’s also the fact that money is a huge barrier to entry for any American trying to get into politics. If you can’t raise the money, you can’t run a campaign — and if you do manage to raise the money (thanks to wealthy donors), you are beholden to them later. Only very rarely does a candidate manage to build a successful grassroots campaign without accepting big donor and corporate money. Democrats often pay lip-service to the idea of getting money out of politics, but in reality, they’re just as happy as Republicans to take money from anyone who wants to throw it at them. More than$1 billionhas been spent by outside groups (independent of and not coordinated with campaigns) to influence the midterm elections. Nearly $128 million has been spent by""dark money""groups which do not disclose who their donors are. And, consider this: Only0.42 percentof Americans have given $200 or more to elections this year. Yet, miniscule as that number is, those peopleaccount formore than 66 percent of all campaign donations. READ MORE: From dumpster fires to deportation buses: The midterms’ craziest campaign ads This is not democracy in action. Until Americans realize that choosing between corporate Democrats and Republicans is like choosing between a slap in the face or a punch in the nose, nothing will be any different. When the ballots are counted on November 6, whether it’s a victory for the Democrats or Republicans, it will still be a tiny minority of elites who hold all the power.

"9 Oct, 2018",Twitter wars spill out onto the streets as Bellingcat’s Higgins meets Graham Phillips,"What happens when two men who have spent the best part of a year sniping at each other on Twitter meet in real life? We found out when Bellingcat’s Eliot Higgins was confronted by UK blogger Graham Phillips. Higgins along with researcher Christo Grozev had been presenting their method for ‘uncovering’ the alleged real identity of one of the Salisbury poisoning suspects, as identified by the UK. But the real drama of the came afterwards when British blogger, Graham Phillips, faced-off with the self-styled investigators outside the House of Parliament. READ MORE: Bellingcat claims second Salisbury suspect also received Russia’s highest award As the Bellingcat boys began they were confronted by Phillips, who proceeded to berate the pair over their funding. “Eliot you need to introduce with: ‘I’m Eliot Higgins a NATO propagandist. I’m here doing Soros, CIA, NATO provocation’...and where’s your evidence?” Phillips, who was initially pushed away by MP Bob Seely, declared he had a right to ask questions as he was an“independent journalist,”to which an unidentified bespectacled man responded“you’re an annoying t**,”before squaring up to Phillips. The journalist eventually managed to get in front of Higgins. His questions stretched from the pertinent to the frivolous, including: To add to the circus, a dozen or so anti-Brexit activists gathered behind attempting to get some air time for their cause. Eventually after much abuse from both Phillips and the dozens of journalists gathered, Higgins responded that he didn't receive any money from NATO, retorting that Phillips – who covered the Donbass conflict – received money from Ukrainian separatists. Higgins did eventually admit that he used to work for the Atlantic Council, a controversial think tank with links to NATO. Phillips then proceeded to film feet away from Higgins deriding much of what they were saying as“a load of gubbins.” Eventually Seely got several police officers to come and escort the limelight stealing Phillips from the scene. Upon leaving, Phillips – surrounded by a dozen photographers – declared“I officially close the circus of Eliot Higgins.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"4 Oct, 2018",The military-industrial-humanitarian complex: Spreading Western hegemony under the guise of virtue,"Shakespeare once wrote that the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. Nowadays, we see the terms ‘humanitarian’ and ‘democracy’ abused to justify death and destruction. Traditionally honorable words such as ‘humanitarian’ and ‘democracy’ have come to acquire a darker and more cynical meaning following their misappropriation to justify the invasion of sovereign nations and to promote the spread of Western military and cultural dominance across the globe. The mainstream media, alongside some human rights activists, assist these ventures by helping disseminate mistruths and by tapping into the emotions of fear, anger and revulsion to soften public opinion and make aggression against a sovereign state appear justified. Running parallel to politicians’ lies that Saddam Hussein possessed WMD deployable within 45 minutes, a strategy was deployed to shock-and-awe the public into accepting the invasion through attention-grabbing headlines crafted to abhor readers with ‘evidence’ of Saddam’s butchery and to generate strong emotional reactions which would cause people to think with their hearts rather than their heads. One such story written by Labour MP Ann Clwyd and published inThe Timesjust two days before the US-led Coalition of the Willing began destroying Iraq, asserted that Saddam possessed a ‘human-shredding machine’ into which adversaries were fed feet-first and turned into fish food. The article, titled“See men shredded, then say you don’t back war,”had the double effect of causing the reader to feel revulsion and of making the anti-war lobby appear callous and indifferent to the plight of the Iraqi people. The existence of a human shredder was laterchallengedand such a machine has yet to be found. Saddam’s real crimes were known to USintelligenceservices, who informed him about the locations of Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, in the knowledge that he would use mustard gas and sarin against them. The US also provided Saddam withclusterbombs and helped him acquire chemical precursor agents. US-based Human Rights Watch estimated that Saddam killed at least290,000of his own people while in power.  However, this figure is dwarfed by the number of Iraqis believed to have died in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, due to occupation forces, sectarian violence or ISIS – this figure isestimatedto be in the hundreds of thousands, if not in excess of a million. The psychological shock-and-awe strategy was again employed in the lead up to NATO’s bombing of Libya, as the US and UK’s on-offrelationshipwith Gaddafi took a turn for the worse after he planned to start selling oil in dinars (a new gold-backed pan-African currency) instead of US dollars or euros, and encouraged his African neighbors to follow suit. The release of Hillary Clinton’s emails in late 2015 revealed that such a move would havestrengthenedAfrican economies and led to competition between the dinar and the dollar or euro. On this occasion, we were treated to the excuse that bombing Libya and supporting the anti-Gaddafi rebels, including Al-Qaeda-affiliatedelements, was necessary as Gaddafi was about to commit amassacreagainst the people of the rebel-controlled city of Benghazi. Another emotive claim designed to mould public opinion into accepting the war affirmed that Gaddafi was giving his soldiers Viagra so they could commit mass rape. An investigation by Amnesty International found no evidence to support this allegation and revealed that on several occasions anti-Gaddafi forces in Benghazi hadmadefalse allegations or manufactured evidence of human rights violations. Gaddafi was overthrown and one of the richest and most-stable countries in Africa became a failed and lawless state controlled by a mishmash of rebel groups, some affiliated or sympathetic to Al-Qaeda. These groupsbeganto persecute, imprison and murder Sub-Saharan Africans on a mass scale, many of whom had come to Libya as economic migrants, accusing them of loyalty to Gaddafi. Furthermore, Libya’s destruction triggered a war in neighboring Mali and helped strengthen Al-Qaeda and ISIS in North Africa. Some of the anti-Gaddafi rebels would later find their wayto Syria. The same script was used in relation to Syria as Western politicians, along with their media and activist allies, worked hard to drum up public support for removing the country’s president from power. In 2013, the emotions of Western audiences were targeted with claims that Assad had used sarin against civilians, meaning his removal from power needed to be acted-on without delay. The allegation remains unproven and a UN-led inquiry later indicated that anti-governmentrebelsthemselves may have been responsible for the attack.  The claims that Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people seem to surface whenever the Syrian government regains large amounts of territory from rebel or jihadist forces. President Assad has been blamed for causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in a conflict forced upon Syria where Saudi Arabia and Qatar (among other states) havefunded and armedrebels that Western intelligence agencies consider ‘moderate.’ WikiLeaks haspublisheddiplomatic cables in which US politicians expressed concern that Saudi Arabian donors were sending money and weapons to groups such as Al-Nusra Front (also known as the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda) and ISIS. Syrian opposition activists claim that as of September 2018 an estimated164,336to522,000people (depending which anti-Assad group you ask) have been killed since the conflict began in 2011. Although the Syrian opposition and their Western and Gulf-state supporters are quick to blame President Assad for these deaths, those killed include Syrian soldiers and pro-government militias who died defending their country from ‘moderate’ (and not-so-moderate) rebels backed by Syria’s enemies, as well as civilians killed by these rebel groups. When Russia came to Syria’s aid in September 2015, at the request of the country’s government, to assist in the fight against ISIS, Al-Nusra and other rebel groups, it faced criticism from the Western media and Syrian opposition groups who accused Russia of propping up a dictator – something of which the UK and US have much experience. Presumably the US and its allies’ desire to overthrow Assad was worth the risk of ISIS continuing its march of terror and destruction across Syria until its flags flew over Damascus. The barrage of attacks against Russia intensified in 2016 when the nation provided Syrian troops with air support in their campaign to retake Aleppo,formerlythe country’s largest city and financial and industrial hub, from a range of rebel groupincludingAl-Nusra Front and a number of non-Syrian jihadist fighters. Newspapers across the political spectrum shed crocodile tears about the number of civilians and babies killed in the Russian bombing, presumably forgetting that the children of Gaza and Yemen are no less immortal when it comes to aerial bombardment. The Western media chooses where to direct its audiences’ emotions. Thediscreditedorganization known as the White Helmets, which receivesfundingfrom the US and several European governments, injected an additional dose of pathos into the mix, showing what they claimed were pictures and videos of their members pulling children and civilians from the rubble in Aleppo. Thecontroversiessurrounding this group have been well documented. Then we saw another media darling, seven-year-old Syrian girl Bana al-Abed, allegedlytweetingpleas for Western intervention,including“Dear world, it’s better to start 3rd world war instead of letting Russia & assad commit #HolocaustAleppo,”though it’s questionable whether she produced such tweets without adult assistance. The US-based Human Rights Watch, which hasreceivedmillions of dollars from billionaire George Soros, cited a report from a Syrian opposition group stating that446civilians were killed by Russian and Syrian planes during the battle for Aleppo in the month of September to October 2016. Elsewhere, Human Rights Watchcitesthe UK-basedpro-oppositionSyrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claims that airstrikes by the US-led coalitionkilled1,064 civilians, including 248 children, during the battle of Raqqa between early June – September 20, 2017. Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the populations of Aleppo and Raqqa in 2016 and 2017 respectively, as of 2018 Aleppo’s population numbers 1.6 million; while Raqqa’s is 61,000. Each civilian death is a tragedy in its own right, regardless of whether it is caused by American, Russian, Syrian or any other nation’s aircraft. However, it must be acknowledged that only Russia and Iran intervened in the Syrian conflict at the request of the nation’s legitimate government. All other nations involving themselves in the Syrian conflict are in breach of international law and warrant expulsion from Syrian territory. Due to Russia’s intervention, Syria will now not go the way of Iraq or Libya and is on the path to again becoming a united and stable nation with a secular and diverse identity. This is one intervention which prevented the destruction of a nation and saved millions from the unimaginable nightmare of life under ISIS or similar groups. This is the opposite of the Western approach, by which a unified nation is plunged into anarchy and the terrorists appear only after the ‘humanitarian’ intervention has transpired. Like this story?

"10 Sep, 2018","Russian elections: Pro-Kremlin domination amid protests, but some hope for opposition in regions","Illegal protest marches, a parliamentary opposition leader punching an agitator in the face and a few unexpected results. These were the standouts from Sunday’s regional elections in Russia. The Far East delivered the first shocks. In Yakutsk's mayoral contest, Sardana Avksentyeva, of the Party for the Renaissance of Russia, beat Aleksandr Savinov, of the pro-Putin United Russia. And in the district’s capital, Khabarovsk, the race for provincial governor will go to a runoff after the Kremlin’s man Vyacheslav Shport shared around 35% of the vote with Sergey Furgal of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). According to initial figures, there are also likely to be second rounds in Vladimir (close to Moscow), Khakassia (in Siberia) and Primorye (also in the Far East). Meanwhile, for the first time since 2007, United Russia was defeated by the Communists in three regional parliament tussles: Khakassia and its Siberian “neighbour” Irkutsk plus Vladimir Lenin’s homeplace, Ulyanovsk, in the central Volga federal district. Furgal’s party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, managed to make headlines for striking a man in the face on Moscow’s Pushkin Square. The alleged victim, a 38-year-old Ukrainian, has pressed charges. The populist firebrand lashed out close to anti-pension reform marches organised by protest leader and anti-corruption campaigner Aleksey Navalny. Some of the illegal rallies saw violent clashes between police and demonstrators, many of whom appeared to be minors. In total, OVD-info (a monitoring group previously backed by George Soros and the US government) claimed more than 1,000 people were detained by security services, with over 450 of them in Saint Petersburg. Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, defended the authorities actions on Monday.“The police act strictly in accordance with the law. These were unauthorized actions,”he said.“Hooligans and provocateurs attacked law enforcers, which is unacceptable and also punishable by law.” One man also far from pension age is Dmitry Artyukhov, who has become Russia’s youngest governor at the tender age of 30. He will lead resource-rich Yamalo-Nenets, an autonomous “okrug” (zone) which is home to Europe’s largest gas fields. Overall, Central Election Commission chief Ella Pamfilova judged the contests to be fair. But turnout was low. Especially in Moscow, at only around 31%, where incumbent mayor Sergey Sobyanin romped home with 70% support against a weak field of opponents. READ MORE: Putin press secretary backs police action against ‘provocative hooligans’ Some analysts believe the lack of enthusiasm might be blowback from the unpopular pension proposals. However, others posit that, given the scale of the changes (a five-year increase in eligibility for both sexes), the backlash against the Kremlin is manageable and doesn't amount to a severe threat to Putin's dominance of Russian politics.

"15 Aug, 2018",Five examples that show internet censorship is as much a threat to the left as the right,"The banning of right wing controversialist Alex Jones from multiple social media platforms last week was a cause of celebration for many liberals, but should those on the left really be so complacent about creeping censorship? So far, the evidence suggest that there is indeed plenty for the left to worry about when it comes to corporations like Facebook and Twitter and their alliances with government censors. 1. Facebook censorship of Venezuelan news In May, Facebook partnered with the Atlantic Council in an effort to weed out“inauthentic content”on the platform. This organization isfunded byvarious NATO governments and a slew of arms manufacturers like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Its board includes names like Henry Kissinger and former CIA director Michael Hayden — and it has consistently lobbied for regime change in Syria and, you guessed it, Venezuela, where it has funnelled large amounts of money intopro-opposition groupsfor years. So, it’s no surprise that weeks after Facebook partnered up with this less-than-objective group, it deleted from its platform the page belonging to top English-language, left-leaning Latin American news outlet Telesur without any explanation at all. The page was restored two days later, with Facebookcitingvague“instability on the platform”as the cause of the block. Telesur just so happens to be one of the only major outlets reporting on events in Venezuela in a manner that goes against the US government position and US mainstream media perspective — so obviously, out with Alex Jones it must go. It wasn’t just Telesur, though. Facebook deleted the pages belonging to independent grassrootsVenezuela AnalysisandHaiti Analysis, which are also leftist websites highly critical of US foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean region.  Facebook's shuttering of@telesurenglish's page comes days after it did the same to@venanalysispage w/o explanation. The latest outgrowth of FB's Orwellian partnership w/ the Atlantic Council. ICMYI,@MaxBlumenthaldiscussed it w/ me on@TheRealNews:https://t.co/3XayXXpg34https://t.co/ZgTaJv0rdU 2. Facebook complying with Israeli deletion orders Last year, journalist Glenn Greenwaldreportedthat Facebook met with Israeli government officials to determine which Palestinian activists should have their accounts deleted. The Israeli government threatened to enact laws forcing Facebook to comply with its deletion orders if it did not do so voluntarily. Of course, Facebook capitulated immediately and set about deleting accounts owned by Palestinian activists. Of some 158 requests submitted (over just four months) by Tel Aviv to Facebook asking for the removal of Palestinian content, 95 percent of them were granted. According to the same Intercept report,  Facebook hasn’t been overly concerned about what Israelis themselves are saying on Facebook and even calls for murder can be ignored by the social media giant. 3. Google and Facebook censorship of left/socialist websites The World Socialist Web Site reported last year that changes to Google’s algorithms had seriously negatively impacted left-wing socialist and anti-war websites. An analysis by WSWS found that 13 such websites had seen their traffic plunge by a whopping 55 percent in the six months since Google had changed its algorithms. WSWS itself experienced a 74 percent drop in traffic between April and July last year. The changes also affected sites like Alternet, which saw its traffic plunge by 71 percent between April and September, Democracy Now (50 percent drop) and Truth-out.org (49 percent drop). Similarly, Police the Police (a page dedicated to exposing US police brutality) and the Free Thought Project (which focuses on government transparency) also saw their Facebook pagetraffic tankin 2018 after Facebook made changes to its newsfeed and search algorithms in an effort to combat“fake news”. PTP traffic dropped from between 12-15 million people per week to about 4 million — and the website had to fire its writing staff as a result.“The left is cheering this on, when historically the left is usually the side cheering for free speech,”PTP founder Jason Bassler told Mic. Amidst all of the celebration over the banning of Jones, some on the left cautioned that in fact, the left may indeed be the“real target”in all of this — and that those celebrating while people like Jones are banned are in fact being“conditioned”into accepting further censorship down the road. As we have been trying to tell you the real target for neoliberal corporate censorship was always the left. Now that they have conditioned public to accept it as a result of Russiagate, the left is in their crosshairs.https://t.co/zt2oMIbtDC  4. Legitimate left-wing protests targeted? A particularly strange example of Facebook’s commitment to banning“fake news”and promoting a nice, cozy atmosphere for everyone online is its decision to delete event pages for anti-racist and anti-fascist protests happening in Washington D.C. The“No Unite the Right 2-DC”event (a counter-rally against a previous white nationalist event in the city) was taken down after Facebook decided it displayed some“coordinated inauthentic behavior”(the kind of random phrase that can no doubt be arbitrarily applied to anything without explanation). The event organizer said in a statement:“This is a real protest in Washington, D.C. It is not George Soros. It is not Russia. It is just us.” 5. Twitter suspending and banning anti-war activists Twitter has come under fire recently for“shadowbanning”conservative accounts, making them harder to find on the platform and having their tweets appear less prominently in people’s feeds in an effort to limit their audience. But again, it’s not just the right. Twitter recently suspended the accounts of Daniel McAdams, the executive director of the libertarian and antiwar Ron Paul Institute and Scott Horton, the editor of the AntiWar.com website. Explaining what happened, McAdamssaidthat he and Horton were suspended after defending former US diplomat Peter Van Buren who had just beenbannedpermanently from Twitter after heated exchanges with journalist Jonathan M. Katz over what Van Buren said was his“unwillingness to challenge government lies”. In one of his tweets to Katz, Buren sarcastically commented:""I hope a MAGA guy eats your face"". Katz reported him for""promoting violence""and Twitter later caved and removed Buren's account. A note from Peter Van Buren@wemeantwelland a screenshot of the boo hoo little bitch who tattled on him.pic.twitter.com/qKukwabnyd In explaining his suspension, Twitter told McAdams that he could not“promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease”— none of which he accepts that he did. Perhaps the really amazing thing about all of this is that it is happening in front of our eyes and the powers that be are not even bothering to lie about it. Elected US officials are openly promoting this kind of censorship as a way to prevent the""sowing of discord""among populations. At a Senate Judiciary Committee last year about“Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online,”Democratic Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono called on social media platforms to prove their commitment to preventing“the fomenting of discord”online. Working hand-in-glove with governments, corporations like Facebook have been handed enormous power to decide what constitutes free speech and which opinions are worthy of being heard. How long will it be before people realize banning Alex Jones wasn’t really a victory at all? Danielle Ryan Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"12 Aug, 2018",Blogger challenges DisinfoLab NGO over Twitter users data abuse in ‘French Russophiles’ study,"The NGO behind the infamous ‘Russophiles’ study has denied their research featured French users’ private data. The blogger who posted the data, however, insists they wiped the files that originally included sensitive information. France’s Twittersphere has been on fire since previously unknown EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based organization that says its mission is to“fight disinformation with innovative methodology”and receives money from Twitter and George Soros, issued a report about 55,000“hyperactive”twitter accounts that had spread the news of the so-called Benalla affair. READ MORE: 'Hyperactive French Russophiles’ study lands Soros-backed DisinfoLab in Twitter data abuse scandal Some users tweeting on Emmanuel Macron’s very own ‘Watergate’ scandal exposing the French president’s protester-beating bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, were labeled as ‘Russophiles.’ DisinfoLab even explained that a ‘Russophile’ is a user who shares“publicly and regularly articles from RT and Sputnik, which are state-funded Russian media”and who promotes“the pro-Russian narrative.” French politicians such as Jean-Luc Melenchon of La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen from the National Rally (NR, formerly Front National) were among many who found their names in the EU DisinfoLab database released alongside the report. Among screenshots of the database circulating on Twitter, several showed a column in which the description of the user profiles were present. READ MORE: Jewish, Gay, Russophile? EU DisinfoLab risks probe over abuse of French Twitter users’ data One such screenshot was released by blogger Olivier Berruyer, the founder of Les Crises (The Crises) blog in which he presents his opinions on geopolitics and economic problems. Berruyer followed the EU DisinfoLab report from the release. These intimate characteristics look like excerpts from users’ own Twitter bios:“Jew born in France,”“Queer, gay, Antifa”,“I am a lesbian.”Berruyer claimed that the files were distributed by one of the authors of the contentious report, Nicolas Vanderbiest August 5.

C'est ce qui avait permis la création de la@CNILpic.twitter.com/FWpvHljCAv Responding to the criticism of their bulk collection of arguably private Twitter user data, EU DisinfoLab released astatementto the media on Saturday, saying that it has“noticed that a screenshot is currently circulating”on social media,“supposedly related to one of the files we have inadvertently released.”The group insisted that“none of these supposed user bios are coming from any of our files.”The NGO said that this may be easily verified“by simply searching”the now-deleted files. It explained that the user locations“were not part”of the files they released and the first file –with 55,000 handles of the Twitter users– only included those“who tweeted on the subject and the number of tweets and retweets they produced.” #DisinfoEUje demande des explications du fichage dont je fais parti sans mon accord.. au@CNILde réagir selon la loi bafouée,..

He released links to several accounts which also posted screenshots with the Twitter biography information, allegedly present in the original files shared by the NGO.

However, in a lengthy statement, Brussels-born Vanderbiest says that he believes that“any data on Twitter is public data”and that there was no“personal intervention”in the report.""I am passionate, too. I am neither a fascist nor a spook,”he insists. Thescale of responseof those who found themselves among those 55,000 was quite enormous. The Twitterati began releasing screen grabs of their handles, making fun and taking pride in being ‘Russophiles.’ Some changed the names of their accounts into numbers by which they were listed by the NGO. Others went even further and renamed their accounts in Russian: “Лемаркич matricule 31884,” “Franck Noir  Чёрный Франк – Opposant N°2045.” PoliticiansJean-Luc MelenchonandMarine Le Penwere upset to find themselves on an apparent blacklist. In the meantime, France’s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) confirmed that it received numerous complaints from Internet users who are worried about being listed by the NGO.

And many nationally-oriented politicians will be furious with these revelations,”he said. It was also quite ironic that the NGO was partially funded by Twitter itself, with money it earned from RT and Sputnik, as the report’s author admitted themselves.

"11 Aug, 2018",‘Hyperactive French Russophiles’ study lands Soros-backed DisinfoLab in Twitter data abuse scandal,"Once a leader in philosophy and fashion, France has now been reduced to falling for tricks recycled from US con artists by Brussels-based grifters, with a little help from Twitter’s ‘mea culpa’ cash and even Uncle George Soros. It all began when EU DisinfoLab, a non-governmental organization based in Belgium,published a reporton Wednesday about how some 55,000“hyperactive”twitter accounts spread the news of the Benalla affair, and accused a portion of those accounts of being“Russophiles.” Within a day, French media were printing headlines screaming about“Russian bots,”prompting the NGO to issue a“clarification”of their findings. Not all of the accounts were“Russophiles,”the outfit said, and the report said nothing about“bots”– but the French public was already outraged. PoliticiansJean-Luc Melenchonof La France Insoumise andMarine Le Penfrom the National Rally (NR) –previously known as Le Front National– who both ended up on the NGO’s list, tweeted derisively about the report, with Melenchon calling the outfit“stupid spooks.” EU DisinfoLab basically used tools –as well as funding– provided by Twitter to compile a list of accounts tweeting about the scandal involving Alexandre Benalla, deputy chief of staff and bodyguard to President Emmanuel Macron. Benalla was fired in Julyafter it emergedhe had assaulted a protester at May Day demonstrations while impersonating a police officer, then tried to suppress the video footage of the incident. Of the accounts thus rounded up, the group identified 27 percent as being part of the“Russian disinformation ecosystem,”described as people retweeting content from RT and Sputnik, or promoting the“Russian narrative.”Examples of the latter were listed as people spreading“false information”like that the Syrian government did not use chemical weapons in Douma (#SyriaHoax) or doubting the official [UK] narrative about the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. Having thus characterized the doubters of the official Western media narratives as Russian agents, the group had the cheek to declare this is“not a value judgment, but a quantifiable fact according to methodology.” What methodology? Well, in part that used byFirstDraft’s CrossCheck project, sponsored by Google partnering with US and French mainstream media outlets, the London School of Economics, and the notorious bloggers at Bellingcat, affiliated with the Atlantic Council, a pro-NATO think tank. READ MORE: Atlantic Council: Pro-NATO pressure group uses distortions to fight ‘disinformation’ However, the approach of EU DisinfoLab is actually closer to that of Hamilton68 Dashboard, a project of the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), which, in turn, is backed by the German Marshall Fund. This alliance ofDemocrats and neoconswas set up last year to“defend democracy”on Twitter from those evil Russkies. Having started from the assumption that agents of the Kremlin were everywhere, the dashboard proceeded to blame them forevery trending hashtag– and the US media swallowed it whole, breathlessly reporting their“discoveries”for months. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has followed ASD since its inception,described itas“the single most successful media fraud & US propaganda campaign”he had seen in years of covering US politics. This hysteria wave eventually crested in March this year, when even such ardent Russiagate-obsessed publications as BuzzFeed (the outfit that published Christopher Steele’s“salacious and unverified”dossier accusing Trump of being a Russian puppet)declaredthe reports of Russian bots to be“total bullshit.” Here is the best part: The funding for EU DisinfoLab’s report was provided by Twitter itself! Back in October 2017, under tremendous pressure from Democrats angry about their defeat in the presidential election, the company “off-ramped” all advertising from RT and Sputnik, then pledged to donate the $1.9 million in (generously) estimated profits to“civil society”projects. Enter EU DisinfoLab, whichadmitted receiving$125,000 from Twitter in January. The group also received $25,000 from George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, though that wasearmarkedfor monitoring the March 2018 elections in Italy. True to form,Soros claimed Russiawas behind the victory ofpopulist partiesover the Eurocrat establishment he favored. So long as Uncle George and social media giants pay good money, and the media is eager to quote those offering to cater to their confirmation bias, there will be outfits such as Hamilton68 and EU DisinfoLab, all too willing to oblige.

"20 Jul, 2018",Are US media outlets repentant about reporting on DNC emails alleged hacked by ‘the Russians’? No,"US media outlets have few regrets about reporting on the shady practices of the DNC, Hillary Clinton’s private speeches, and other scoops revealed by emails allegedly leaked by Russian hackers, The Washington Post reports. Erik Wemple, The Washington Post's media critic, decidedto reach outto American news organizations after Neera Tanden, the president and CEO of the Soros-funded, Clinton-friendly Center for American Progress, accused“every reporter who gleefully trafficked in stolen emails via Wikileaks”of“abetting a crime – not illegal activity by itself but unethical and immoral.” A reminder: every reporter who gleefully trafficked in stolen emails via wikileaks abetted a crime.  Not illegal activity by itself but unethical and immoral. The curious media critic posed an intriguing question to some of America’s most prominent outlets: Do you have regrets about reporting on the email leaks, now that Robert Mueller has indicted 12 Russians for allegedly hacking into the DNC and other entities? Their answers – some more defensive and self-righteous than others – could best be summed up as: No, not really. In the WashPost,@ErikWempleasks numerous media outlets if they regret reporting on the newsworthy aspects of the DNC & Podesta emails (which, contrary to the inane cliché, has nothing to do with risotto recipes). Their basic answer: no; that's our jobhttps://t.co/AmV4AAU5PS Nearly all of the outlets pointed to the fact that the leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, contained information that the American people deserved to know. “The stories that came from the emails were newsworthy. Not only Donna Brazile’s question sharing, but the details of Hillary Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street, speeches she had declined to make public,”New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet wrote to Wemple.“Imagine if we had chosen not to publish those emails at the time, interesting details about a presidential candidate in the middle of an election. That would have been a political act.” Geoffrey Ingersoll, editor in chief of the Daily Caller, asked aloud whether journalism would even exist if newsrooms discarded leaks based solely on whether the source (alleged or known) had honourable intentions. “If [the emails] are true and damning, do we ignore them because of the messenger? How much swampy oppo research fuels journalism for the betterment of democracy? Probably a lot, I would guessб”Ingersoll said. He then went on to point out that the media happily reported on salacious allegations leveled against Donald Trump by the ‘Steele dossier’ – even though the sensational document could not be verified and was compiled by retired UK intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who was paid $168,000 to do opposition research on Trump for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the DNC. “We were selective in publishing from the available emails. Our standard was whether they contained information genuinely relevant to voters,”Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said on behalf of her own paper.“Not publishing anything merely leaves a vacuum for others to fill, working with a lower standard or none at all. We published according to our standard, and we stand by our decision.” HuffPost’s Washington bureau chief during the 2016 campaign, Ryan Grim, said that his website repeatedly pointed to allegations that Russia was behind the email leaks, but emphasized that any fallout from their contents had to be blamed on Clinton and Clinton alone. “I don’t quite understand the argument that you would ignore something newsworthy. … The excerpts from the [Clinton Wall Street] speeches were probably the most memorable things that surfaced,”he wrote.“The irony is that was an own-goal from start to finish. The Clinton campaign certainly can complain that Russia hacked and dumped that material. But Russia didn’t force her to give the speeches and Russia didn’t force her to keep the speeches a secret.” Wemple’s survey also put to bed the notion that the emails contained nothing newsworthy in them. “Just take the [former DNC chair Donna] Brazile situation: Revelations about her question-sharing shed light not only on a top DNC official but also on the role of cable-news networks in choosing presidential candidates and the penetration of news organizations by partisan pundits,” he noted. “And we’re supposed to pass up such a story?” At the very least, Wemple has offered up a fresh take on who can – or should – read Wikileaks. After all, CNN’s Chris Cuomo claimed in October 2016 that it was illegal for the public to read the leaked emails. This job, according to Cuomo, was reserved exclusively for trustworthy media outlets like CNN. CNN falstely states that it unlawful for the public--but not for CNN--to search WikiLeaks#PodestaEmailspic.twitter.com/sZMoM9iT2i Of course, the notion that Russian hackers delivered the emails to Wikileaks is a completely unproven allegation – perhaps a fact that all the US outlets above continue to struggle with.

"13 Jun, 2018","Le Pen, Orban, Wilders among Kremlin’s ‘5th column’ hell-bent on destroying Europe, says EU bigwig","The EU Parliament’s Brexit chief has accused Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage and more Eurosceptic politicians of being Kremlin-funded “fifth columnists” working to destroy Europe from within. He even claimed Brexit was a Russian plot. While addressing the EU parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian MEP and lead Brexit negotiator for the bloc, singled out Britain’s Nigel Farage, France’s Marine Le Pen, and Dutch MP Geert Wilders as“fifth columnists”who“take Kremlin money and intelligence”. The staunchly pro-EU Belgian then warned about a“circle of evil around our continent”stretching from“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin, [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and, on a bad day, –and that’s every day at the moment– even [US President Donald] Trump”. The name-calling escalated quickly as even Poland’s Jaroslaw Kaczynski –who can hardly be called a Putin fan, to put it mildly– made it to the ranks of“Russia’s men”in the EU. His pal, Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban, as well as Italy’s Deputy PM Matteo Salvini concluded the list of European right-wing politicians deemed traitorous by the bigwig. “Europe has a fifth column in its ranks: Putin's cheerleaders who want to destroy Europe & liberal democracy from within: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage, Orbàn, Kaczynski, Salvini use Kremlin money & intel. Like Farage's friend Arron Banks, who colluded w/ Russians to deliver #Brexit,”Verhofstadt wrote, in a similar comment posted to Twitter. He then claimed that Arron Banks, a wealthy businessman and co-founder of Leave.EU, had“colluded”with nameless“Russians”to“deliver”Brexit, one of many remarkably vague accusations which he failed to clarify or support. Responding to the inflammatory tweet, Farage shot back:“This is a baseless lie. I have never received any Russian financial or political support. I suggest you withdraw,”the British MEP and former UKIP leader wrote. Responding to Verhofstadt’s remarks, UKIP MEP Ray Finch described the Belgian politician as a“federalist fanatic”who was just“lashing out.”According to the Independent, FinchsaidVerhofstadt is“incapable or unwilling to accept that the British people voted to leave the EU. Calling 17.4 million people ‘Putin’s puppets’ is so outlandish I fully expect him to blame it on the influence of singer Iggy Pop or the lunar cycle. He is an EU conspiracy theorist who deserves our pity. Funny he did not mention his great friend George Soros who has publicly pumped billions into political campaigning.” READ MORE: Pro-Brexit donor Arron Banks admits meeting Russian ambassador … then briefing US security services Farage and Verhofstadt regularly take swipes at each other in the parliament’s chamber. After Verhofstadt was appointed as the EU parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, Farage described the Belgian MEP as a“fanatic”and the“high priest”of the European Union. “In fact, there is only one real nationalist in the room and it's you [Mr Verhofstadt] – because you want flags, anthems, armies, you are an EU nationalist,”Faragetoldthe parliament.“I frankly think that this appointment amounts to pretty much a declaration of war on any sensible negotiating process.” Think your friends would be interested?

"7 Jun, 2018",We are not a ‘yes sir’ govt – Italy’s Di Maio as he defies NATO over Russia sanctions,"In response to NATO’s warning that Rome better leave sanctions on Russia as they are, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the new government will not take orders from others and will keep moving closer to Russia. Di Maio, who is the new Minister of Economic Development and joint Deputy PM - a post shared with Matteo Salvini - in the country’s new Euroskeptic government, said on Thursday that his administration“will not be spineless and yielding to the will of other states”and had no intention to conduct the“yes sir”diplomacy. The new coalition government has been showing resistance to other Western countries’ attitudes towards Moscow. On Wednesday it came under NATO’s fire following Conte’s speech where he addressed the aching need to move closer to Russia and lift sanctions which are damaging the Italian economy. While Conte’s Tuesday speech was heartily applauded in parliament, it raised some eyebrows at NATO, which made sure to voice its disapproval at Italy’s desire for change. ""We must maintain political dialogue with Russia,”the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg,said,“but the economic sanctions are important"".US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchinson warned Italy that, as a member of the alliance, it would better put its overtures to Russia to rest“until Moscow changes its behaviour”, otherwise“it would be a very bad signal to send to Moscow”. NATO’s warnings didn't seem to alter the line that the new government has taken on foreign affairs. “We will be open to have dialogue with Russia, the way it has always been,”Di Maio said during Thursday’s visit to Italy’s largest defense and aerospace company, Leonardo, in his hometown near Naples. Asked whether NATO’s rhetoric worried him, Di Maio, insisted that, although Italy would remain a NATO member, it had no intention to break ties with Russia. So,“as far as international relations go,”Di Maio said, he was“not worried”. The Deputy PM highlighted that Italy has“historically”been the NATO member to promote talks with Moscow. Besides NATO, billionaire George Soros alsovoicedhis disapproval of Rome’s pro-Russian ambitions, hinting that Salvini, the leader of the second coalition party the League, may be receiving money from Russia. While being one of the founding members of the EU and calling Europe its home, from now on Italy will look after its own interests, which is going to be the core principle of any future negotiations and collaboration with Brussels, Di Maio assured. He added that the country was“already witnessing some results”, since the coalition has taken this line. In order to prove his point, he evoked latest disputes over Italy’s push for a revision of the so-called Dublin rule, which requires migrants to ask for asylum in the country of entry to the EU. This along with what Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier called“egotistical closures”of the boundaries to some European states, which forced Italy to receive over 700,00 refugees since 2013. “It sufficed to voice our position on illegal migration, to have [them] slow down on [the revision of] the Dublin rule, because that accord dumped the problem on Italy”, Di Maio said, adding that despite growing accusations of alleged antagonism to migrants, the new government will be more attuned to the needs of its citizens. Italy’s new government, formed by the Salvini-Di Maio coalition, has made it clear it was moving away from powerlessness whether it came to the migration system or its relationship with Russia and the EU. The coalition has repeatedly emphasised the need to improve Moscow-Rome relationships and lift sanctions, which was earlier stipulated in their accord and brought up by the new Premier before a confidence vote Think your friends would be interested?

"5 Jun, 2018","Soros perpetuates myth of Russian bogeyman, blames Putin for Italian anti-immigrant party","Apparently convinced that the Italian people support the flow of illegal aliens into their country, billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros imagines a Russian hand behind the rise of Italy’s Euroskeptic party. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge For globalists like George Soros, who hasspenta sizeable chunk of his personal fortune lobbying EU leaders for the unimpeded flow ofmigrantsinto their respective states, the last few days have been an unmitigated nightmare. Two Italian anti-establishment parties, the hard-right League and the Five Star movement,forged a coalitiongovernment that puts a gang of Euroskeptics into power in the EU’s fourth-largest economy. It is thefirst populist governmentin Western Europe. Today, when Europeans speak of their ‘Euroskepticism,’ the criticism is invariably linked to the eurozone’s double-edged sword: on the one side of the blade is the single currency, which has not lifted all boats in Italy, not by a long shot. On the other side is a massive influx of illegal immigrants pouring into the continent, the majority of which are fleeing from NATO-backed wars in the Middle East. Italy, smack on the front line of the“migrant invasion”from North Africa, has been forced to accept some 750,000 migrants. Combined with a sputtering economy, many Italians are now enraged with their“legacy parties”and even more so with blissfully detached Brussels. To shed some light on the national mood, Italy's new Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvinitolda group of cheering locals that the island of Sicily will no longer serve as""Europe's refugee camp."" So, who does George Soros blame for this undercurrent of anger and resentment now ripping through the world of Italian politics? Russia, of course. Making an appearance at the Trento Economic Festival, Sorossaid, without a shred of evidence to support his claims, he was""very worried about Russia's influence on Europe in general and on the new Italian government.” ""I do not know if Salvini was funded by Moscow, but public opinion would have the right to know,""he said. He also expressed his“concern”over the new government’scallfor ending EU sanctions on Russia. Such comments must be deeply disconcerting, if not insulting for many intelligent, free-thinking Italians. Aside from the obvious interference in the affairs of a foreign state, something Soros’ native Hungaryunderstandsvery well, Soros is basically saying that the Italian voter lacks the mental capacity for coming to the conclusion that Italy’s immigration policy is deeply flawed, as even Soros himself hasadmitted. Thus, the only reasonable explanation for the dramatic change in Italy's political climate, the argument goes, is“Russian meddling.”Soros’ condemnation of Russia, aside from being unfounded and slanderous, is dripping with hypocrisy considering the huge sums of money he has put into lobbying EU politicians to accept his plans for a border-less world. Salvini, meanwhile, saying he felt“ashamed”that Soros was invited to speak at the economic festival, defended himself against the accusations, declaring he has“never received any lira, euro or ruble from Russia.”He then went on to defend Vladimir Putin,callinghim“one of the best statesmen in the world.” The League's economics policy chief, Claudio Borghi, also hit back,tweeting:""Soros worried by the Italian government? Then it means that we are going in the right direction... The wind has changed for [Soros] and for all those who have profited from the deaths of hundreds of people."" Soros, at a sprightly 87-years old, did not waste the opportunity while in Italy to express his indignation towards Donald Trump, the US leader who was also smuggled into power, according to the Democrats and various Russophobes, by the Kremlin. Once again, the underlying message here is that the Americans, like the Italians, are simply incapable of formulating any sort of an intelligent opinion for themselves. After 12 years of war and stagnant economic growth under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the US electorate should have been simply ecstatic over the possibility of Hillary Clinton, yet another pro-war establishment figure, getting into the White House. And if things somehow turned out otherwise - indeed, as they most certainly did - well, it must have been due to the Russians. According to this delightful bit of absurdity, Russian trolls managed to swing themulti-billion dollarUS presidential election in their favor due to a few hundred tweets and Facebook advertisements. And yes, there are people who actually buy that story. By refusing to admit that failure is an integral part of the democratic process, individuals like George Soros and Hillary Clinton will simply lie, cheat and hoodwink the system – media, judicial and political – until they get their way. And that is precisely what is now happening in the United States. Despite ‘Russiagate’ disintegrating into an embarrassing 'he said, she-said' National Enquirer expose, complete with an adult-film star, Trump continues to be embroiled in an investigation that has entered its second year. The crazy can be expected to continue at least until congressional midterms in November. If the Democrats are able to clinch victory, the world will most likely be treated to many months, maybe years, of impeachment proceedings against the most controversial political figure to grace the halls of Washington in a long time. Say what you will about Trump, but the fact that the establishment will go to such incredible lengths to discredit him means they genuinely fear him. Why is a completely different question. There is an upside to all of this madness, at least as far as Russia is concerned. By continually and predictably resorting to the ‘Russia card’ whenever things don’t go their way, which has been rather frequently of late, people like Soros and Clinton, the so-called ‘globalists,’ only serve to cheapen and invalidate their transparent agenda. Ironically, Soros borrowed exactly the same argument against Russia that the Clinton campaign used: ‘The Kremlin is trying to weaken the EU.’ What impeccable logic! The fact is that, if Putin or anyone else was really interested in weakening the EU or the US (if such a thing were even possible), they would not trouble themselves by putting populist politicians in power, who would work to reverse the rot of unregulated immigration, and other such irritants. In fact, they would just let Soros and his merry band of mischief makers continue doing exactly what they have been doing all along: destroy the EU from within with a disastrous agenda. In closing, it bears mentioning that President Putin justsigned a lawmandating the implementation of counter-sanctions against any state or person involved in“hostile actions”against Russia. Whether that legislation works to tame the anti-Russia hysteria now inflaming the planet with fake news remains to be seen. @Robert_Bridge Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"5 Jun, 2018",Top quotes from Putin’s Austrian interview – so tense he had to resort to German to make his point,"Vladimir Putin’s extensive chat with Austrian TV got so heated that he had to switch to German to ask the interviewer not to interrupt. The president deflected lunges at “Kremlin trolls,” MH17 and even his bare-chested photos. Putin is meeting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache on Tuesday. The visit to Vienna will be his first trip abroad since his inauguration for the second consecutive term – and the fourth in total – in March. Before arriving in the Austrian capital, Putin spoke to Armin Wolf from the state ORF channel. The conversation quickly became tense, with hardball questions and straightforward answers. Wolf interrupted Putin several times, prompting the Russian leader to ask him to“be patient,”before eventually switching to Wolf’s mother tongue.“Seien Sie so nett, lassen Sie mich etwas sagen (Please be so kind as to let me say something),”he said in German, a language he speaks fluently. ‘Why rock Europe?’ “It is not our aim to divide anything or anybody in Europe,”Putintoldthe interviewer, addressing one of the things of which Russia is persistently accused by some Western politicians and media. People in Austria and elsewhere in Europe should“put this idea out of their minds”that Moscow supposedly wishes to sow distrust and discord within the EU, the president said. READ MORE: Russia doesn’t seek to divide EU, our biggest trade partner – Putin to Austrian TV “Why rock the European Union in order to suffer further losses and incur costs or miss possible benefits from cooperation with the European Union?”asked Putin, noting that the EU is, in fact, Russia’s largest trade partner, so Moscow wants it to be“united and prosperous.” ‘Only 2-way road for Korea’ Putin finds the prospect of a full-scale military conflict with Pyongyang especially“dreadful”since North Korea is Russia’s immediate neighbor, and some Korean nuclear test sites are situated near the Russian border. Although Russia “pins great hopes on the personal meeting between [US] President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,”the path to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a“two-way road,”Putinexplained. “If the North Korean leader is backing up his intentions with practical actions, for example, giving up new tests of ballistic missiles, new nuclear tests, the other side should reciprocate in a tangible manner,” he said, calling regular US military drills in the area “counterproductive.” ‘Russia blocked from MH17 probe’ Putin criticized the ongoing international investigation into flight MH17, which was downed in Ukraine in 2014. He said Russian experts“have been denied access to the investigation,”while Russian arguments are“not taken into consideration,”and nobody on the investigation team“is interested in hearing us out.”Ukraine, on the other hand, being a“party interested in the results,”has been given access to the probe, Putin added. ‘Crimea never coming back’ Crimea became one of the most contentious issues during the talk. Responding to a question about what should happen in order for Russia to hand the region over to Ukraine, the president firmlystated:“There are no such conditions and there can never be.”Crimea opted to rejoin Russia in 2014 after a popular vote showed overwhelming support for the move. Putin stressed that the referendum was arranged after an“unconstitutional armed coup”in Ukraine’s capital Kiev, and it was the Crimeans themselves who ultimately decided their own fate.“Crimea gained independence through the free will of the Crimeans, expressed in an open referendum, not as a result of an invasion by Russian forces,”he stated. READ MORE: ‘Is this not democracy?’: No conditions will make Russia return Crimea to Ukraine rule – Putin ‘Ask State Dept about Soros’ Moscow“has nothing to do”with the so-called internet“troll farms”and it is ridiculous how Western media claims that a single Russian businessman, Yevgeny Prigozhin, managed to influence election results in the US, Putin said. He added that, while he is familiar with Prigozhin personally, he’s unaware of his activities online. The president then hit back, bringing up the controversial American-Hungarian billionaire George Soros, who has supported numerous NGOs in different countries.“There are rumors circulating now that Mr Soros is planning to make the euro highly volatile. Experts are already discussing this. Ask the [US] State Department why he is doing this,”Putinsaid.“The State Department will say that it has nothing to do with them – rather it is Mr Soros’ private affair.” ‘Tsar? Not true’ Presenter Armin Wolf noted that Putin has been either president or prime minister since 2000, and some are calling him a“tsar”of Russia. Putin responded that comparing him to a royal figure is“false and completely detached from reality.”He stressed that he governs strictly in accordance with the Russian constitution. “International observers had no serious criticism as to how the election was organized or regarding the election results,”Putin said of his most recent election victory.“Therefore, there is no doubt that democracy has taken hold in Russia.” ‘Not hiding in the bushes’ The conversation did end on a lighter note, though. When asked about his world-famous bare-chested photos from vacations and various outdoors activities, which often captivate the press and social media, the Russian leader replied in a lighthearted manner.“You said ‘half-naked’ not ‘naked,’ thank God,”Putinjoked.“When I am on vacation I see no need to hide behind the bushes, and there is nothing wrong with that.” If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"4 Jun, 2018","US wouldn’t admit backing ‘euro-meddler’ Soros, yet Moscow’s asked to comment on troll farms – Putin","The US State Department would never admit to backing George Soros’s alleged attempts to “rock the euro,” yet Kremlin is being told to come clean on private internet companies meddling in politics, Vladimir Putin told Austrian TV. In an interview published Monday, Armin Wolf of the Austrian state ORF channel went full steam ahead into the issue of the so-called“troll farms,”which Moscow is often accused by the western media of operating. These nefarious“farms”are being given credit for many feats, from trying to divide voters on social media to altogether securing the victory of US President Donald Trump.

I know a lot of people in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.” The President said he was unaware of Prigozhin’s internet activities and that, whatever they were,“the Russian state has nothing to do with it.”Putin then raised a question of double standards, drawing an analogy of a figure particularly controversial in European current affairs. “There is such a personality in the US – Mr. [George] Soros, who interferes in all affairs around the world. I often hear from my American friends that ‘America as a state has nothing to do with [his activities],”Putin, who is traveling to Austria on an official visit on Tuesday, said. “There are rumors circulating now that Mr. Soros is planning to make the euro highly volatile. Experts are already discussing this. Ask the [US] State Department why he is doing this. The State Department will say that it has nothing to do with them – rather it is Mr. Soros’ private affair. With us, it is Mr. Prigozhin’s private affair. This is my answer. Are you satisfied with it?”he said.

"1 Jun, 2018",Brussels sees threat to democracy everywhere liberals don’t win – Hungarian foreign minister,"The EU doesn’t know how to deal with its member Hungary, where the strong prime minister, Orban, dares to defy Brussels’ vision for the future. How will Hungary hold up under pressure and how will this dispute shape the EU? We talked to the foreign minister of the country, Péter Szijjártó. Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Péter Szijjártó, it’s really good to have you on our programme again. Welcome back. Péter Szijjártó:It’s my honour. Thanks for letting me be here. SS:Lots to talk about.There are tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over the rights of the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Ukraine. And you have said that Ukraine “stabbed Hungary in the back”. What is Hungary’s reaction going to be? PS:Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the European Union to help the Ukrainians to get the visa-free regime and to make the EU-Ukraine Association agreement to come into force. And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue. So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine. SS:So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn’t abide by Ukrainian laws. Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? PS:Well, you know, we are part of the alliance. So it’s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro-Atlantic integration path. And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities. The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities. So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission. SS:So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? PS:There’s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the European Union about how we see this situation. We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations. We will see whether there’s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that. SS:Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs. You’ve said those are lies. Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? PS:We had and we’re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know. We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti-migration policy. We made it very clear that it’s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary. It’s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together. We don’t want to let neither the European Union nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don’t want to invite. We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us. And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept. He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis. He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states. So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament. And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach. You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context. SS:Are they groundless? PS:Yeah, absolutely. I mean, just let me give you two examples. All these accusations say that there’s no media freedom in Hungary. But if you look in the Internet, for example, if you look at the web-pages you will see that anti-government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive. In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country. In some Western European countries it did happen. Or when it comes to anti-Semitism - it’s a constant accusation against us. Although we’re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti-Semitism. There’s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest. We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well. It’s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets… SS:… in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely. PS:… and compared to that we’re always under accusations. SS:Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary - and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights. Could it come to that? PS:There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well. So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland. We opposed that because we absolutely think it’s based on double standards. When you take facts into consideration there’s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary. For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system. But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn’t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court. So these are all closed issues. So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament - these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary. SS:So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary. And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn’t meet those demands whether it’s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: “We may not fund you in the next EU budget”. Here’s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to  6 percent of your budget. First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr. Orban said: “We don’t need German money anyways”... PS:Well, you know, Hungary’s interest is the European Union to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong European Union. We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the European Union. We have an export-to-GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the European Union to be strong and to have a competitive economy. On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy. But this is not a one-way road. We don’t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends. These funds are to be given to us based on contracts. Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit. This is one lane of the road. And the other lane of the road is the European funding. So, this is not a one-way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation. We totally reject that false context, we’re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free. This is not true. We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well. And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies. SS:There’s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland - the East vs West - because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point. I don’t think Brussels likes it.  What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? PS:We’re absolutely interested in the unity of the European Union. We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the European Union because the European Union must show unity. Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let’s put it this way, well, it’s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the European Union. We are the two countries where a one-party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country. We have absolutely stable political systems. Many times it’s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels. There’s a big debate in the European Union whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way. The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because… SS:… yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration. That’s what France and Germany want. Do you think it’s a viable thing? PS:Our position is that European Union can only be strong if there are strong member states. So we don’t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong European Union would be realistic. We think that only strong member states can form a strong European Union. That’s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the European Union, meaning that we don’t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don’t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized. What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking. Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes. But the answer shouldn’t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes. SS:Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the European Union as an alliance of sovereign states. European Union is the union that crosses state boundaries. It’s, like, the core principle of the European Union. European Union is based on the principles of liberalism. Your country is a nation-based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing. Russia’s same way. On ideological level there are so many differences. In a basis it’s not even economics. Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? PS:Well, actually, it’s not everything… SS:But core things... PS:Yeah, but if you look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we’re somewhere in the middle, so, there’s nothing extraordinary in this regard. We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well. For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable. If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course. That’s why what we’re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit-based society. There are debates about that as well. But all in all our interest is the strong European Union because within the strong European Union Hungary can be strong. SS:There’s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are “sandbags” that can be thrown away. Could it come to that? PS:Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland - the Visegrad countries - are members of the European Union and will be members of the European Union. Even more than that. This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the European Union. Our growth rate is much higher than the European average. Everybody speaks about the German-French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness. But if you look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France. That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong. Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy. So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the European Union because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the European Union being strong as well. That’s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us. SS:The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now. There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions. There’s the center - Brussels, France and Germany - who want more integration and maybe a two-speed Europe. It’s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now. Something needs to change. We don’t really know what. Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you’ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won’t be as integrated as France and Germany? PS:If you mean that the European Union is faced with historic challenges, you’re right. Not only one. We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with. So that’s why I think it’s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the European Union because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states. For instance, take the migration issue - Hungary’s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it’s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country. SS:I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it’s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway. What’s the point of being so tough on it if you were going to secretly accept those people anyway? PS:These are two totally different things. Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn’t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth. These two things shouldn’t be confused because these are two different issues. SS:The mood in the European Union in general is changing. Austria has the first anti-immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far-right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it’s pretty much center-right as well. Do you feel like saying “we’ve told you so, we’ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying”? PS:You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right. But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the European Union the main issue was migration. That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you’ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary. And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti-migration policies. You’ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who’s definitely representing an anti-migration policy. In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti-migration parties. In Hungary we’ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country. You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior. And you’ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France. You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth. So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn’t serve the target of a better future of the European Union. SS:So how come so many countries in the EU are anti-immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that. Just as many countries are against anti-Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending  them all of them agree silently to extend them. Why can’t you be as firm on anti-Russia sanctions? PS:Well, if you ask me whether there are double standards I would say “yes”. We are a small country. And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here. If you come to the St.-Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries. If you see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents. If you look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved. If you look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised. If you ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are. There’s a big debate in the European Union whether the sanctions were successful or not. But definitely the unity of the European Union is very important. SS:...Even if it is at the expense of the anti-Russian sanctions? PS:… that’s why the prolongation of the sanctions has already been decided upon. But it’s interesting to come here to see the big Western European companies making business with the Russian counterparts. SS:You know, we’re open to anyone who wants to come and make business with us. Thank you very much for this interview, Foreign Minister. Good luck with everything. PS:Thank you. I really do appreciate it. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more.

"10 May, 2018",How the US stifles free speech: Reviving McCarthyism & nurturing Orwellian society,"The new or expanded Global Engagement Center under the State Department seems to be morphing into what one might someday recognize as Orwell's ""Ministry of Truth."" Recent events over past months have caused many to suspect the reliability of news and information provided to us, often by our own governments. Alternative news sources threaten to disrupt the message or narrative crafted by governments and large organizations. The US Global Engagement Center is mobilizing in response to counter alternative media, conflicting perspectives and foreign influence such as ‘Russian Propaganda.’ The rush to judgement, complete failure to follow international norms, and subsequent actions in response to both the alleged poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in the UK and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria leaves many questions unanswered. That narratives of government officials and mainstream media (MSM) are in lockstep despite the lack of any real evidence makes one suspicious of the ultimate objectives. Whatever these objectives may be, they certainly appear misplaced and bring increased international tension. Both these instances have the appearance of ‘false flag’ operations. However, despite the lack of a thorough investigation, British Prime Minister May was quick to state the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent, Novichok, and claimed it was “highly likely” that it was the Russian government behind the attack.  Both the UK and Russia are signatories of the internationalChemical Weapons Convention. There are setproceduresto be followed in the event of the suspected use of chemical weapons, such as Novichok, which include notification of the OPCW, cooperation of state parties and the instigation of a fact-finding investigation. These procedures were not followed and, in fact, Russia has yet to be included in the investigation or even provided samples. There seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding so many aspects of the entire incident. Despite the lack of evidence and the fragmentation of the initial storyline, the Skripal poisoning served certain interests by diverting attention away from the UK government and toward Russia. The subsequent mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK, US and EU countries caused the further deterioration of international relations. Throughout this period, MSM toed the party line and lately it appears to have gone silent. Closely following the Skripals’ poisoning, surprise-surprise, the famed White Helmets released a video of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria.  Once again, despite no evidence and prior to the arrival of OPCW inspectors, the US, UK, and France launched airstrikes against Syria, targeting supposed chemical weapons facilities. There has yet to be any indication that a chemical weapons attack actually took place.  Local citizens and doctors have testified recently that there was no chemical attack and that the incident was staged. Once again, MSM fails to cover the inconsistencies of the story which call in to serious question the actual occurrence of the attack. Information from MSM sources, for the most part, is completely in compliance with information either being filtered or suppressed to support the desired narrative. The storylines, absent of credible facts or evidence, is reminiscent of the ‘Trust Me!’ approach regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction that led to ‘Operation Iraqi Liberation’ (renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom).  The most recent instances add to the ongoing Russophobic hysteria engulfing the West under a very questionable pretext. Those that are skeptical of the official narrative or act to provide a differing perspective are frequently ridiculed and demonized, often accused of being one of Putin’s useful-idiots. The list seems to be endless and spans from Russian scholarProfessor Stephen Cohenand Australian journalistJohn Pilgerto UK Labour leaderJeremy Corbynor, at times, even theRepublican Party. This past year we have seen many alternative media sources essentially “blacklisted” by the secretive organizationPropOrNotwhichpublishedthe names of more than 250 alternative news sources, accusing them of being Russian agents. The Washington Post promoted thestoryand, originally, ProporNot’s“List”.  Only later did the Post add an introductory comment and delete the direct link to the List. The story was subsequently picked up and distributed by theDaily BeastandUSA Today. InOctober, another“blacklist”surfaced, identifying more than 2,300 guests of the Russian news station, RT. The list was published by a Czech Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), ‘European Values,’ whose largest donor just happens to be George Soros’ Open Society Foundation – in addition to US, UK, and EU government contributions. We often view that the foundation of democracy lies in the freedom of one’s beliefs, in one’s right to express ourselves whether that is through print, speech, or the sharing of ideas. The First Amendment enshrines these concepts with the Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom to Assemble. Yet the ability to shape those ideas and thoughts relies on the ability to have open access to information and to participate in a dialogue of our beliefs and ideas. With the advent of media, and more recently with the internet and social media, access to and sharing of information with differing views has expanded immensely. However, recent initiatives have acted to stifle this open and free communication.  The passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 114-328, FY 2017 NDAA, section 1287) codified the Global Engagement Center and significantly expanded its role. The Global Engagement Center (GEC) evolved from the original Counterterrorism Communications Center (CTCC). The CTCC was established in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Its objective was the coordination inter-agency messaging and to coordinate specific messaging for the Department of State and Department of Defense.  The CTCC went through several restructurings through the years until it was the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communication (CSCC) – with essentially the same mission. The organization had minimum funding and no direct line item from Congress. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13721 in March 2016, which officially established the GEC in lieu of the CSCC. The GEC purpose and structure were similar to the CSCC. It was tasked with leading inter-agency efforts in support of US government-sponsored counterterrorism communications. Section 1287 states that the GEC’s purpose is to“counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts”that threaten US national security interests as well as security interests of US allies and partner countries. This significantly changes the GEC’s role from one of counterterrorism to one of countering foreign communications per se. Moreover, it provides the new GEC with significant resource authorizations well beyond those previously provided. Along with the significant expanded mission area and increased authority, the GEC will receive substantially greater funding and will include direct funding from Congress as well as authority for an additional $60 million to be transferred from the Department of Defense. The GEC expansion of responsibilities is a result of the challenges of articulating a consistent message and to counter alternative information and perspectives. Legislation seeks to strengthen the GEC in order to counter foreign influence, primarily Russian and Chinese disinformation efforts. This evolution of the GEC is not without challenges. Earlier versions of the GEC were underfunded and undermanned.  The legislation and subsequent mission shift has been given to an organization operating with a focused mission to counter primarily extremist terrorism and ill-prepared to counter global information flows with varying perspectives. For instance, based on theNew York Times,“not one of the 23 analysts working in the department’s Global Engagement Center – which has been tasked with countering Moscow’s disinformation campaign – speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts.”As implied byVanity Fair, resource challenges, a changing mission, new technology, organizational confusion, and leadership uncertainty have contributed to the questionable performance and future of the GEC.  Yet, the NDAA 2017, as well as more recent emphasis fromCongress, provide the clear intent from Congress for the increased global role of the GEC, along with the authority and resources to support it. This, along with the recent confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new GEC leadership, may see the GEC rapidly evolve to complete its transformation and become the master of information. Congressional pressure on technology companies, specifically social media organizations, throughout the evidence-free Russiagate hearings has contributed to filtering what and how we access information.  Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been grilled in hearings and are taking steps to control the flow of information. Facebook has engaged fact-checkers to verify information. One wonders who checks the fact-checkers?  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google have also developed filters and Trust Indicators to prioritize what is seen, or not seen, and how, byusers. This is done in the name of combating ‘fake news’ or countering alleged Russian propaganda. These actions, as well asdemonetizingsites, controlling advertising (RT and Sputnik advertising banned on Twitter), censoring information (SouthfrontandVeterans Today),de-ranking as with RT, or cancelling and suspending accounts (SyrianGirl banned on Facebook and YouTube) directly influence one’s access to information, essentially censoring for the good of the public. Censorship and disinformation infringes on our ability to access factual information, to form our own judgements, to enlighten ourselves to differing perspectives.  It essentially acts to shape our perspectives to preconceived narratives that may be counter to our own underlying values. It is a realization of George Orwell’s ‘Newspeak’.  It is a direct attack on the most fundamental right of a free and open society – the right of free speech.  We have been gradually witnessing the erosion of the underlying principles of democracy. The threat is not from any foreign power, it’s from within. Where are we going as a country?  Are we reincarnating McCarthyism?  Are we nurturing an Orwellian society? I would hope not but similarities are definitely there.

"11 Apr, 2018",Foreign mass media flouted Russian law & pedaled propaganda in election coverage – senators,"The Upper House Commission for the Protection of State Sovereignty has registered more than 1,000 incidents of the western mass media meddling in the recent Russian presidential polls. The overall number of negative reports relating to the election was some 55 times bigger than ones with a positive outlook. “Over the period of our monitoring we have found over 1,000 mass media reports that described elections or mentioned them indirectly, but these were not just informational reports. Foreign mass media have deliberately engaged in propaganda, in Russian and on Russian territory,” head of the commission, Senator Andrey Klimov, was quoted as saying Wednesday by TASS. Most of these reports originated from the US mass media, Klimov noted. “They [US media] published over a half of the  total number of reports, and also mass media from Great Britain, France and Germany. Over the campaign period for one positive report we counted 55 reports or articles that were deeply negative.” Klimov also said that 12 Russian-language outlets belonging to western mass media directly violated Russian law when they released propaganda targeting Russian voters. “Most of them are organizations that get their funding in the United States, usually through the US State Department as they are parts of the so-called BBG [Broadcasting Board of Governors].” Western journalists had attempted to sully President Vladimir Putin’s reputation, promoted candidates that had the weakest voter support and also slandered the electoral process, according to Klimov. Foreign mass media, he said, had continued to report on the day of the election and the day before. Releasing any information about the election during that period is not permitted as there is a moratorium in place. Klimov noted that many of the western journalists concentrated on the so called “voters’ strike” which confirmed the foreign origins of this campaign, even though some Russian activists also promoted it. The head of the commission said that western countries invested serious time and effort to promote the bypassing of official internet blocks while guaranteeing absolute anonymity to users. “They do not spare money for this. The BGG allocated $25 million in 2017 alone in order to overcome various barriers,” Klimov said, noting that this system had been designed, not only for Russia, but also for China and Iran. Western nations, he noted, have changed the agenda from giving direct instructions for voters to embarking on various PR stunts and applying pressure with regard to sanctions. “They are pushing feelings of horror and instability, releasing information that everything [in Russia] is bad, the markets are in fever and the oligarchs are fleeing the country. They are pushing these topics right now,” said Klimov. The senator insisted that the non-governmental and non-profit organizations with foreign funding also attempted to influence the Russian elections, despite the restrictions and bans imposed on these so called ‘foreign agents’ groups. He said that the US National Endowment for Democracy placed a lot of money into such Russian groups (96 grants were awarded in 2017 alone) and the Soros Foundation was very active in working with Russian organizations. The commission will release a more detailed report on foreign interference in Russian elections after Putin is sworn in as president on May 7. “We have no doubts that this tremendous and massive campaign has failed. But still, we must remember that our partners refuse to calm down and continue to attack Russian sovereignty,” Klimov concluded.

"10 Apr, 2018",Debunked: How VoA journalist pushed fake news story on ‘Russian tanks crossing into Ukraine’,"The easily-verifiable false claim by Voice of America journalist that Russian tanks were filmed entering Ukraine was shared thousands of times before being debunked.

Tlisova did not reveal her source for the undated video, which showed several armored vehicles moving through a nondescript village. Nonetheless, despite flimsy evidence to back up the accusation of a foreign invasion, Twitter went into overdrive. Although Tlisova herself has fewer than 5,000 followers on the social network, the message was shared over 2,200 times in a matter of hours. “How about another round of European sanctions on Putin cronies each time a column of Russian tanks is spotted rolling into #Ukraine? That would help bring an end to this madness,”tweeted Maxim Tucker, a former journalist and current employee of the George Soros-funded Open Society Foundation.

RT Digital’s Verification Unit conducted its own independent inquiry into the original footage and also pinpointed the location of the convoy to the village of Petrovka, north of Rostov-on-Don. By matching the satellite imagery to the footage, it was easy enough for the team to determine that the military vehicles were moving south, in the opposite direction of the closest border with Ukraine. For her part, Tlisova refused to issue a retraction, stating in a series of additional tweets that the new information was an“update,”even as it completely changed the substance of the story. posted two updates to this video.

"19 Feb, 2018",Indictment of Russians over US election meddling is case of pot calling the kettle black,"If the US federal grand jury indicts 13 Russians for meddling in the US vote with “no allegations” that it influenced the outcome, then the investigation by Mueller should disband and take its place on the garbage heap of history. F. Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst. At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily-critical technologies. Those cases served as an early warning to decision-makers of potential policy issues. He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia. F. Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst. At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily-critical technologies. Those cases served as an early warning to decision-makers of potential policy issues. He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia. On the face of it, to suggest that 13 Russian individuals attempted to alter the course of the US democratic election process is absolutely laughable, considering that the US mainstream media had teamed up with the Hillary Clinton campaign to barrage Americans daily with relentless stories of alleged Russian collusion with the campaign of Donald Trump to alter the 2016 election outcome. To date, no such collusion has been uncovered. If only 13 people allegedly attempted to alter the election outcome, you have to ask yourself: Is that all there is? So, 13 Russians allegedly planted ideas on popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where crazy ideas already abound. There never was any evidence in the indictment that even suggested any Russian attempt to manipulate through hacking voting stations. The alleged disinformation campaign amounted to calls for demonstrations or the printing of ads, which in many instances were hilarious.Certainly, discerning and naturally skeptical Americans know the difference and have never thought that alternative ideas were a threat to the US democratic system, whether it’s by Russians or even American billionaires who use their fortunes to try and alter the US political process. Indeed, ongoing congressional investigations reveal something even more sinister in the US democratic process. Namely, that the Clinton campaign paid for a so-called Russian dossier to undermine the Trump campaign and it was done in actual collusion with high-level officials of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is unprecedented in US politics and is tantamount to the action of a police state. And it was perpetrated by Democrats who concocted the Russian collusion scheme to discredit the legitimacy of the Trump election. If the US was inferring in the indictment that 13 Russian individuals sought to undermine the entire American democratic process, it is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black, since there are stark examples of past US efforts to interfere in elections and, indeed, overthrow democratically elected governments of other countries. Many of those past instances continue to have a major adverse impact on US influence in foreign policy. In 1953, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. The impact culminated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and has affected what there is of US-Iranian relations to this day. During the administration of President Richard Nixon, he and his then-national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, were involved in the1973coup of democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende. Once again, the CIA was involved in the Chilean military’s ousting of Allende, which then committed atrocities on its own citizens. In his 90s today, Kissinger continues to give President Trump foreign policy advice. Fast-forward to modern-day efforts to affect the outcome of elections in other countries, former president Barack Obama’s repeated efforts to interfere in the elections of other nations are more numerous than most past US presidents. Ironically, the mainstream media played down those efforts. Among those examples, during the 2015 election in Israel, the Obama administration illegally attempted to prevent the re-election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to major personal and policy differences. The administration covertly funneled State Departmentgrantsto opposition groups to the tune of some $350,000, including a group called the One Voice Movement. One of Obama’s field directors from his last presidential campaign actually oversaw the operation in an effort to topple the Netanyahu government. As usual, no one was held accountable. In 2014, the Obama administration was instrumental in supporting and helping to finance the violent overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. To further underscore Obama’s involvement in the internal affairs of another country, the American Spectatorreportedthat the government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, had obtained government documents showing that“the US government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center-right government in Macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist George Soros.”Judicial Watch further stated that then-Obama ambassador to Macedonia, Jeff Baily, sought to funnel millions of dollars from the State Department and USAID to groups created by Soros to overthrow the Macedonian government. In 2011, Obama was instrumental in the ousting of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to push the election of Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Morsi.A secular leader, Mubarak was ousted, similar to Obama’s efforts along with his then-Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in the violent military overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011. Based on what is now known, Clinton’s hatchet man, Sidney Blumenthal, had helped provide information particularly on potential oil contracts in the country, which prompted her to convince an at-first reluctant Obama to take military action with a“coalition of the willing”from among NATO countries for regime change in Libya. Last, but not least, is the example of former President George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, which led to the violent overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. As in the case of the 1953 coup in Iran, the US experience in Iraq has had a lasting impact on American influence not only in that country but throughout the entire Middle East. Ironically, US law prohibits the use of tax dollars to influence foreign elections. Clearly, if America doesn’t want interference in its own democratic process, it shouldn’t be doing it to other countries by overthrowing their governments and inflicting pain and suffering on the lives of millions of people.

"16 Feb, 2018",Soros accuses Facebook & Google of manipulation and deceit,"Billionaire investor George Soros says social media companies, particularly Facebook and Google, are becoming “obstacles to innovation” as they have become too powerful and should be broken up.  While often playing an“innovative and liberating role,”the companies are deceiving users“by manipulating their attention”and“deliberately engineering addiction”to their services, Soroswroteon opinion website Project Syndicate. According to him, the two firms profit from making users stay on their websites for long periods of time. Due to the size of the companies, content providers have to“accept whatever terms they are offered,”but that is only helping Facebook and Google become more profitable. “Indeed, the exceptional profitability of these companies is largely a function of their avoiding responsibility – and payment – for the content on their platforms,”Soros wrote. “The companies claim that they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulation, aimed at preserving competition, innovation and fair and open access.” Soros added that as Facebook and Google grow, they are looking to bundle more services to offer to consumers. They“exploit the data they control”and use“discriminatory pricing”to do this, he explained. “There is a similarity between Internet platforms and gambling companies. Casinos have developed techniques to hook customers to the point that they gamble away all of their money, even money they don't have.” Google and Soros-backed organization team up to ‘fact-check’ news storieshttps://t.co/SOoVEvBUBnpic.twitter.com/OkoUTTcBpB Social media companies are“inducing people to surrender their autonomy”with the power to shape people’s attention“concentrated in the hands of a few companies.” The investor warned these“data-rich IT monopolies”could form an alliance with authoritarian states that“may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even George Orwell could have imagined.” He said this could happen in Russia and China first, adding that EU regulators are more“farsighted”than those in the US when it comes to social policies.

"13 Feb, 2018",Watch how fake news is born and spread after release of PR firm’s Russia-Brexit report,"The release of a report that claims Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik were a major influence on the outcome of the Brexit vote has unwittingly allowed people to see exactly how “fake news” is formed and spread on Twitter. The self-funded report was produced by PR firm 89up, a lobbying firm that runs communications for pro-EU pressure group ‘Best for Britain,’ which is part-funded by billionaire George Soros. At the time of writing, 89up had removed the slide-show presentation linked to the report from its site. While the agency promised more information would be released in the coming days, it has been pointed out that the initial release contained no statistical evidence in the form of tweets or articles to back up the claims being made. Twitter itself has said that it cannot find evidence of Russian Brexit meddling. READ MORE: Twitter dismisses Russian interference in Brexit referendum After the release of the 89up report, the findings were reproduced on ‘Byline,’ which is a website purporting to be “crowdfunded independent journalism.” Writer JJ Patrick used the headline “Russia More Influential Than Leave Campaigns During Brexit.” The claim contained in that headline is not backed up by any part of 89up’s report. The inference of that sensationalist headline would be that RT and Sputnik were somehow more influential in Britain than Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, the Daily Mail, The Sun etc, etc. Even the most anti-Russian, pro-Brussels conspiracy theorist would wonder about the veracity of that claim. That didn’t prevent 89up CEO Michael Harris from retweeting Byline’s story, calling it “a very good in-depth piece on our report” (Impressively, Byline’s story managed to contain more typos than 89up’s original report). Do you believe that headline? Shortly after that tweet, Political Editor of Buzzfeed UK Jim Waterson, who was clearly suspicious about the interpretation, asked Harris “Do you believe that headline?” Harris immediately admitted that the headline was not completely accurate and that “The lack of ‘on Twitter,’ which is our caveat, is a bit problematic.” So Harris, one of the leaders behind the report, was sharing a story which he almost immediately admits was not 100-percent correct. It was then pointed out by another Twitter user that, while 89up talked about Russian media achieving “134 million POTENTIAL impressions” linked to the EU vote, Byline had removed the key word “potential” in its report. “Impressions” simply measure how many people may have potentially seen a tweet, even if that includes scrolling straight past it. A number of people insisted in relation to this report that it is more or less impossible to measure whether the tweets in question have any influence at all. In its report, 89up claimed: “The Kremlin’s propaganda channels had three times more impact on Twitter than both the official Leave campaigns combined.” Whereas the opening of the Byline report claims“New analysis by 89up.org confirms the scale of Russian media influence during Brexit vote dwarfed the main Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns, driving anti-EU propaganda, disinformation and fake news to influence voters.” The claims in this opening paragraph in Byline are clearly different from its source material – enough to be misleading about what was actually being claimed. There is no mention of Twitter, for example. While 89up cannot be held responsible for mistakes made by a separate outlet, questions should be asked about why one of the main drivers of the report was still willing to re-share information which he admits is misleading. Incorrect or misleading information being pushed by a separate entity on social media in order to influence an audience to come to a certain point of view is exactly how fake news is spread. Let's say RT ran months of exclusively pro-EU messaging, would your lobbying firm be investigating ""foreign interference""? What if the country had voted Remain? I'm guessing no. When Harris was asked by RT’s head of communications whether he would produce a similar report if “RT ran months of exclusively pro-EU messaging,” he failed to provide an answer.

"12 Feb, 2018",Pro-EU PR firm self-funds questionable research to blame Russia for Brexit,"A UK-based PR company has self-funded its own “research” to accuse Russian-funded media outlets of affecting the outcome of Brexit. The firm 89up uses a combination of typos and selective evidence to make its point. A few cards on the table about 89up. It’s a PR company, the kind which is not exactly without an agenda of its own. It does for example describe itself as the “sole communications agency for Best for Britain.”  You may recognize the name ‘Best for Britain,’ because it’s the anti-Brexit group that’s been in the headlines recently due to the fact it’s part funded by arch-meddler, billionaire George Soros. That awkward moment when a PR company lavishly payrolled by a foreign oligarch to meddle in British politics, complains to@thetimesabout “potential Russian interference”pic.twitter.com/LGkwMgM17Y In simple terms, this report into alleged Russian meddling around Brexit comes from a group which has links to a foreign billionaire who is publicly meddling in Brexit. Speaking of which, here’s a tweet from a communications worker at Soros’ Open Society Foundation, who is apparently shocked and aghast at these findings. Wow. Anti-EU articles and tweets by#Russianoutlets had 4 times more impact than official Leave#Brexitcampaigns, according to new report by@89_up. 261 articles said to be viewed 134 million times. Remember, the Kremlin's objective is a weakened UK.https://t.co/JcEKGZVK4X The CEO of 89up, Mike Harris, has left quite an online trail behind him attacking Russia, or passionately defending Soros. There’s nothing wrong with that – a person is free to have his views – but there is a clear hypocrisy on show with his willingness to accuse others of having questionable motivations. 89up boasts that its report into RT and Sputnik is self-funded, but who that’s supposed to reassure is hard to say. The firm claims it’s worried about the role of “autocratic regimes in shaping public opinion.” But not the role of foreign billionaires with questionable motives, it seems. The report promises to “lay bare the extent of Russian media interference” into Brexit. Actually, all it really does is point out that RT and Sputnik covered the EU vote, wrote some stories and then tweeted them out. 89up’s clients should be concerned that this is regarded as such a sinister and advanced concept to a company specializing in social media. Utter, rubbish. I should know. So let’s get to the evidence, such as it is. This paragraph illustrates the quality of the conclusions: “Social media activity by the two channels spiked on the day of the referendum, with both platforms increasing their Twitter activity significantly which matched the surge in Russian bot activity on the day.” The revelation there is that the social media accounts of news organizations were busy on one of the biggest news days in recent decades. I’d guess it matched a surge in general journalistic activity as well. And what about this: “Many of the articles by the platforms during the referendum were highly misleading, with RT and Sputnik publishing grossly exaggerated or false stories on European refugee flows, immigration to the UK, the role of MI5 during the referendum and the CIA role in creating the EU.” The inference being that RT should ignore stories about Brexit buses and UKIP immigration posters when every other media outlet is reporting on them. If there was any misleading information, that’s because the politicians campaigning were being misleading, and RT was reporting it. It’s claimed the evidence of meddling was “in plain view” during the referendum. It’s absolutely true to say that RT’s website and social media accounts are openly available to anyone who’s interested – that’s the very nature of them. “Our researchers analysed the most shared of these articles, and identified 261 articles with a clear anti-EU bias to the reporting.” It’s not made clear who decided which were biased, why an anti-EU bias is particularly bad given it turns out Britain itself appears to have that very same bias, and why only the most shared articles were examined. “RT’s coverage was biased …. towards the Leave campaign.” Have the researchers read or watched any other media in Britain? ""The report shows the social reach of these anti-EU articles published by the Kremlin-owned channels was 134 million potential impressions."" Where were those impressions? If they were in America, for example, they're going to struggle to influence Brexit. “No other state controlled media outlet came close to social exposure of Russian media.” If anything, this is congratulations to RT’s social media department, because that is kind of their job, to get stories read. It’s not more sinister just because it’s linked to the word Russia, and perhaps there should be some examination about whether there is a widespread demonization happening here. The claims include that RT and Sputnik are different from other media outlets because, among other things, they’re “state-funded” and appear to be about “soft power” and “influence.” Does that remind you of anyone else? (Y’know, the BBC, the corporation which faces constant accusations of anti-Brexit bias.) Optimistically, 89up says it has handed its report to the British Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and called on “parliament to investigate role of UK-based Russian propaganda outlets.” The group of MPs looking into alleged Brexit meddling has continuously failed to find evidence that it actually happened, so it will probably gratefully accept the report. More revelations are promised in the coming days, but based on the opening accusations, no one should expect to see a smoking gun. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"12 Feb, 2018",Not all Russia’s fault! Meet the foreign billionaires pulling Britain’s political strings,"As a Russian woman – a UK citizen with tenuous ties to Putin – is “exposed” as a Tory Party donor, RT looks past the media’s anti-Kremlin obsession to meet the foreign billionaires who actually have sway over British politics. The Mirror reported that Lubov Chernukhin,“the wife of a former crony of Vladimir Putin”(ex-Russian Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Chernukhin), paid £30,000 (US$41,450) in donations to the Conservatives to dine with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. Chernukhin’s successful bid at the Tories’ lavish Black and White Ball fundraiser will also get her a private tour of Winston Churchill’s War Rooms in Whitehall with Williamson. Chernukhin – who is a banker in her own right, but (according to the Mirror at least) resides in her husband’s shadow – is now a British citizen. Previous Tory Party conferences have seen her successfully bid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and £20,000 to dine with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson in Edinburgh. If one puts the mainstream media’s Russia-hating agenda aside for just a moment, however, it’s clear a number of other international billionaires actually wield influence over the UK’s political landscape. The Aussie businessman and easily the most influential person in media. He’s also the man behind pro-Tory newspapers the Sun and the Times. His publications have made their allegiances to the Conservative Party clear. The Sun openly backed the Tories in the 2017 General Election… betting on the winning horse yet again. In the lead-up to last year’s ballot, Murdoch reportedly told his employees at the Sun and the Times that the future of the company was dependent on the Tories winning the election, and told them to be harsher on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, the 2011/2012 Leveson inquiry into media standards and ethics in the UK revealed that Murdoch had been in close contact with every prime minister in recent decades, including Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron. The anti-Brexit Hungarian-born billionaire, who’s a citizen of the US, is bankrolling a campaign to stop Brexit – and if that isn’t international meddling, then we just don’t know what is. On Monday it was revealed that Soros has pledged another £100,000 to his anti-Brexit campaign. Soros said that engineering a“mere reversal”of the EU referendum result was simply not enough. The cash is on top of the £400,000 he donated last week to the ‘Best for Britain’ organization to fund a nationwide anti-Brexit campaign. Before that, he donated £700,000 to not only stop Brexit in its tracks, but to reverse the process entirely. Technically, Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere (let's call him Rothermere for short) is British. He’s the chairman of DMG, which runs the Daily Mail and Metro, and both push a Conservative agenda. While he may have been born in Hammersmith, Rothermere has non-domicile tax status. In other words, he lives in France, dodges tax and owns his media businesses through a complex structure of offshore holdings and trusts. In April 2015, the Sunday Times estimated his net worth was £1 billion. That’s a lot of cash to splash around if you want things your way. READ MORE: David Cameron took on Britain's most powerful newspaper editor over Brexit while PM ... and lost Owners of the Telegraph Media Group, David Barclay and Frederick Barclay are estimated to be worth £7.2 billion, according to the Sunday Times Rich List of 2017. Among other companies, they own the Telegraph Group Limited, parent company of conservative-aligned papers The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. They’ve been accused of tax avoidance, placing their assets under complicated trusts and ownership to dodge the taxman. The reclusive duo is notorious for avoiding publicity, so David's son Aidan manages their businesses in the UK. The two brothers bought the lease of Brecqhou Island in 1993, off the coast of Sark (one of the smallest of the British Channel Islands). There they have been accused of meddling in local politics, including a mass-firing of 170 staff from Barclays-backed investments on the island as the locals did not support political candidates backed by the brothers. In another Sark scandal, the only doctor on the island left after he was slammed by a Barclays-owned local paper for using a boat rather than the Barclays' helicopter to transport a patient who was having a seizure to hospital on the nearby island of Guernsey. The Barclays' paper reported the doctor’s actions as negligent, and despite support from the patient's family and the British Medical Association, the doctor left the island over the story.

"9 Feb, 2018",Soros & the £400k Question: What constitutes ‘foreign interference’ in democracy?,"You’d have to have a real sense of humor failure not to laugh. The news that US billionaire Soros donated £400k to an anti-Brexit group came on the day that YouTube said they found no evidence of Russian interference in Brexit. is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Repeat After Me (with robotic arm movements):“Unproven Russian involvement in Brexit – terrible! Impose more sanctions on Moscow! A £400k check from an American billionaire for an anti-Brexit campaigning group – that’s no problem; it’s helping our democracy!” You don’t have to own a brand new £999 state-of-the art Hypocrisy Detector from Harrods, to pick up on the double standards. Just having a few functioning brain cells and thinking for yourself will do. For months in the UK we’ve been bombarded with Establishment-approved conspiracy theories – peddled in all the ’best’ newspapers – that Russia somehow ‘fixed’ Brexit. Getting Britain to leave the EU was all part of a cunning plot by Vladimir Putin, aka Dr. Evil, to weaken Europe and the ‘free world.’ Even West End musical composer Andrew Lloyd-Webber, who knows quite a bit about phantoms, seemed taken in by it.“By quitting Europe, I fear that we are hastening Putin’s dream of the break-up of the EU – and with it, potentially, western civilisation,”the noble Lorddeclaredin July. Never mind that we don’t have a single statement from Putin or other senior Kremlin figures saying that they actually supported Brexit. These Establishment Russia-bashers know exactly what The Vlad is thinking. And never mind that RT and Sputnik, which we are repeatedly told are“propaganda arms of the Russian government,”ran articles by pro- and anti-Brexit writers. The same people who told us Iraq had WMDs in 2003 were absolutely sure it was those dastardly Russkies who had got Britain to vote ‘leave.’ The irony is of course that there was significant foreign interference in Brexit. But it didn’t come from Moscow. Or Obama actually visiting the U.K. to urge people to vote Remain. Imagine if Putin did the same for Leave! The US has always wanted Britain to stay in the EU. In April 2016, two months before the Referendum, President Obama made it clear what he wanted when he visited the UK. He warned that if Britain exited the EU it would be“at the back of the queue”for trade deals with theUS. Just imagine if Putin had said that. The Russophobes would have spontaneously combusted. Then of course there was the backing the Remain camp had from the giants of US capital.Goldman Sachsand JP Morgan donated £500,000 each to the ‘Britain Stronger in Europe’ group, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – £250,000 each. Again, repeat after me (with robotic arm movements):“This is not foreign interference… This is not foreign interference!” You’ve got to see the funny side of this: all that hysterical fake news about ‘Russian interference’ in Brexit & here we have one side receiving £400K from a US billionaire who is part of the US political establishment. Is that not ‘interference’ ?!!https://t.co/URzrB3ciLd The point is not whether we are for or against Brexit. Or whether we think George Soros is a malign influence who only acts out of self-interest or an old sweetie-pie with the good of humanity at heart. The point is the double standards that are causing our Hypocrisy Detectors to explode. Let’s think back to December 2016. Then, the pro-war and fiercely anti-Russian Labour MP Ben Bradshaw told Parliament that it was“highly probable”that Russia had interfered with Brexit. Fourteen months on, what have we got? On Thursday, the global head of You Tube’s public policy, Juniper Downs, said her company“had conducted a thorough investigation around the Brexit referendum and found no evidence ofRussian interference.” Twitter meanwhile says it detected 49 (yes, 49) accounts from what it claimed to be a“Russian troll factory,”which sent all of 942 messages about Brexit – amounting to less than 0.005% of all the tweets about the Referendum. Twitter said the accounts received“very low levels of engagement”from users. If the Kremlin had planned to use tweets to persuade us to vote ‘leave,’ they didn’t really put much effort into it, did they? Finally, Facebook said that only three “Kremlin-linked” accounts were found which spent the grand sum of 72p (yes, 72p) on ads during the Referendum campaign. Which amounts to the greater“interference”? 72p or £400K? Erm… tough call, isn’t it? You might have thought, given his concern with ‘foreign interference’ in British politics, that Ben Bradshaw would have been urging ‘Best for Britain’ to return George Soros’ donation. Au contraire! His only tweets about it were retweets of two critical comments about the Daily Telegraph, and the BBC’s coverage of the story. Conclusion: Those who rail about ‘Russia meddling in Brexit’ but not Soros’ intervention aren’t concerned about ‘foreign interference’ in UK politics, only ‘foreign interference’ from countries they don’t approve of. Those who are quite happy peddling ludicrous conspiracy theories about Russians shout“conspiracy theorist”(or worse) at those who report factually on proven meddling from others. The Daily Express hit the nail on the head in their Friday editorial which said:“Just what does George Soros think he is doing pouring £400,000 into a campaign to stop Brexit. For a start he is not actually a resident of this country so it has nothing to do with him.” That really is the rub of the matter. And Bradshaw and co. have no adequate response except to shoot the messenger. If we look at the affair with an even wider lens, the hypocrisy is even greater. The US has been gripped by an anti-Russian frenzy not seen since the days of Senator Joe McCarthy. The unsubstantiated claim that Russia fixed the election for Donald Trump is repeated by ‘liberals’ and many neocons too, as a statement of fact.“I don’t know that the public understands the gravity of what the Russians were able to do and continue to do here in the United States. They’ve attacked us. They’re trying to undermine our democracy,”film director Rob Reinersaid. But the number one country round the world for undermining democracy and interfering in the affairs of other sovereign states is the US itself. While Establishment journos and pundits have been foaming at the mouth over ‘Russiagate’ and getting terribly excited over ‘smoking guns’ which turn out – surprise, surprise – to be damp squibs, there’s been less attention paid to the boasts of former Vice President Joe Biden on how he got the allegedly ‘independent’ Ukrainian government to sack its prosecutor general in a few hours.“I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money…"" “I said, ‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,”Bidensaidduring a meeting of the US’ Council on Foreign Relations.“Well, son of a b***h. He got fired.” Again, just imagine the furore if a leading Russian government figure boasted about how he used financial inducements to get another country’s Prosecutor General to be sacked. Or if a tape was leaked in which the Russian Ambassador and a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson could be heard discussing who should or shouldn’t be in the new ‘democratic’ government of another sovereign state. But we had the US Ambassador toUkraineand the US Assistant Secretary of State doing exactly that in 2014 – and the ‘Russia is interfering in the Free World!’ brigade were as silent as a group of Trappist monks. It’s fair to say that Orwell would have a field day with the doublespeak that’s currently on show. The cognitive dissonance is there for all to see. Repeat After Me: Unproven Russian interference – Bad. Proven interference from other external sources – Good. What’s your problem?

"8 Feb, 2018",Anti-Semitism accusations leveled at the Telegraph following its George Soros ‘exclusive’,"Theresa May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, has been accused of “peddling textbook anti-Semitic tropes” in a Telegraph article outlining George Soros’ £400,000 donation to a pro-EU lobby group. Following the article’s publication on Thursday, Timothy was accused of anti-Semitism in the front-page exclusive he co-authored, and which RT UK along with many other national outlets picked up. The article outlines how Soros, described by the Telegraph as the“man who broke the Bank of England”in reference to the fortune he made betting against the sterling in the 1990s, is attempting to undermine the Tory government by donating £400,000 (US$560,000) to pro-EU group Best for Britain. The group is campaigning for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal agreed between Parliament and the EU. The accusations of anti-Semitism were made by Guardian columnist Owen Jones, academic Bonnie Greer and King’s College professor Jonathan Portes, among others. Portes drew a response from Timothy when he asked if he and the right-wing paper were really endorsing“anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.” Your tweet insinuating a terrible thing about me - which you now accept is wrong - has not been deleted and keeps being RTd. You should remove it.https://t.co/W2IF8mpsip Jones called out the Telegraph for""anti-Semitic dog whistling,""before doubling down on his statement. Sorry, I’ve got this wrong. As the people correcting me rightly say, this isn’t an anti-Semitic dog whistle on the part of the Telegraph, it’s an anti-Semitic bullhorn. Are the@Telegraph&@NickJTimothyreally endorsing the Hungarian government's anti-semitic conspiracy theories about George Soros?https://t.co/TJgGBQf4zp If anyone ""broke the  Bank Of England"" it was Norman Lamont, now a Peer of The Realm.#GeorgeSorosbet that  would happen, and he won.#NickTimothy& the wretched@Telegraphare peddling textbook Anti-Semitic tropes.I know you're losing.... but are#BrexitersTHIS desperate?https://t.co/rQgmOSwtB7 Portes and Jones made the allegations on the contents of a separate comment box halfway down the article which details how Soros had been accused of“meddling”with governments’“internal affairs”through his Open Society Foundation (OSF). The authorship of the comment box is credited to Callum Adams. Adams details how Soros, a survivor of Nazi Germany, was accused by“hardline Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban of trying to orchestrate an ultra-liberal crusade in the country.”Orban himself faces accusations of anti-Semitism. Timothy rebutted allegations of anti-Semitism, saying they are“as absurd as they are offensive.” Throughout my career I’ve campaigned against anti-Semitism, helped secure more funding for security at synagogues and Jewish schools, fought to lift the cap on faith schools, and supported Israel. The accusations and insinuations against me are as absurd as they are offensive. Despite Timothy’s protestations, the allegations were backed by some of the UK’s most prominent journalists and commentators. Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard highlighted the controversial implications of using the phrase“secret plot.” Telegraph story is disturbing because of the use of the idea it’s a “secret plot.” Soros is incredibly open about what he does. Say it’s wrong; fine. But idea it’s a secret plot is exactly the line being used in Hungary and elsewhere precisely because he is Jewish. Journalist James Ball cautioned May and her government to distance herself from such rhetoric. This needs saying clearly: baiting people on George Soros conspriacy theories is a tactic currently being used by would-be autocrats and anti-Semitic groups across the world.Theresa May and Conservative MPs should distance themselves from this tactic, and fast.https://t.co/wgCQM8RwOW Some did, however, come to Timothy’s defense. Sir Eric Pickles, the former Tory cabinet minister who is the prime minister’s Special Envoy for Post-Holocaust, branded the claims“ludicrous”due to Timothy being""a consistent friend of Israel."" @NickJTimothy@Telegraphwe have known each other for a good years, we were on opposite sides during the EU referendum, the idea that you would endorse Antisemitism views is ludicrous. You are a consistent friend of Israel. Nasty smears add nothing to arguments Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage chipped in tweeting at Alastair Campbell, writing:“Why is it as soon as Soros is mentioned, suddenly you’re an anti-Semite? Is the man beyond question?” Why is it as soon as Soros is mentioned, suddenly you’re an anti-Semite? Is the man beyond question?https://t.co/LyfRBy8A1r While others argued critics are missing the point altogether, as there should be more uproar over Hungarian-American businessman Soros chucking the eye-watering sum of £400,000 to an anti-Brexit campaign group. You’ve got to see the funny side of this: all that hysterical fake news about ‘Russian interference’ in Brexit & here we have one side receiving £400K from a US billionaire who is part of the US political establishment. Is that not ‘interference’ ?!!https://t.co/URzrB3ciLd In turn, the Russian embassy in London appeared to echo this as it expressed frustration over the UK government’s failure to act on the news of the alleged“political collusion”by Soros. When it comes to pointing the finger at Russia, however, the government needs no second invitation.

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington. In recent years, the think tank business has exploded. But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let’s be clear, the term ‘think tank’ essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying ‘lobby group.’ Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve – and promote – the agendas of their funders. However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like ‘Senior Non-Resident Fellow’ and ‘Junior Adjunct Fellow’ and the like. And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations. Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages. That's 9th-century France, to be precise. But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as ‘RUSI (1831)’, still exist today. The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie. And his ‘Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’ (1910) is still going strong. Yet, the real boom in the ‘think tank’industrycame with the era of globalization. With a 200-percent rise in numbers since 1970. And in recent years, they’ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington. One country that largely hasn’t bothered playing this game is Russia. Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups. Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia. Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO. The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization’s agenda across Europe and North America. However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media. Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills.  What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO’s reason for being. Who are its people?The Atlantic Council’s list of lobbyists (sorry, ‘Fellows’!) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world. For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially- wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia’s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark. Then there’s Joe Biden’s“Russia hand,”Michael Carpenter and their recent co-authored ‘Foreign Affairs’ piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country. Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama’s administration has also found a home here. Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a“geolocation expert”who has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake. Lastly, we can’t forget CNN’s Michael Weiss, the self-declared“Russia analyst”who, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can’t speak Russian. Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve. NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow. The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State. Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing. Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the ‘old continent’, but it does have an outpost in Warsaw. This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment’s agenda there. Or, in its own words, creating a“Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States.”   What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia. It whips up tensions, even when they don’t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry. For example, it spent last year hyping up the ‘threat’ from Russia’s and Belarus’ joint ‘Zapad’ exercises, even running a sinister-looking countdown clock before the long-planned training commenced. CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it“could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War”and dismissing basically all Moscow’s statements on its actual nature as“disinformation.” Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years. Poland chooses Raytheon. Even if the missiles don't work, America will defend its customershttp://t.co/QwqrkCiosD The dedicated ‘Cold Warrior’ doesn’t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past. Thus, he’s more-or-less an out-of-touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise. He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill-informed than Lucas. His work for the US state-run broadcaster led to him being described as the“Lord Haw Haw of Prague,”where he has been based for some years. CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists. The former is a Polish-American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council’s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia-bashing world is. Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi-organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang-ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors. Which is, at least, honest. FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence. Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy – ‘regime change’ experts who are surely interested in CEPA’s remit to also cover Belarus. The US Mission to NATO and NATO’s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash. Founded:1972 What is it?Don’t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin. It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt’s Bonn-government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan. Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of ‘Ostpolitik’, which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia. What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest. However, in the past 12 months, it’s taken a very strange turn. Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German-American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project. Its centerpiece is the ‘Hamilton 68 Dashboard’, which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite’s consensus as“Russian trolls.”The reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly-funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking“how do you identify 'pro-Russian amplifiers’ if… themes dovetail with alternative American political views?” Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high-profile bunch of lobbyists. They include Toomas Ilves, an American-raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut-out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia. Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the ‘architect of the Iraq War’ and former CIA Director Michael Morrell. Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who recently announced he was partially abandoning his Russian scholarship and has “lost interest in maintaining my (sic) ability to speak/write Russian” is another team member. Im also done doing research about Russia for now.   Russian politics is not so interesting these days.  I have lots of other academic interests.  (Ill remain engaged on the foreign policy side.)https://t.co/grSlZXZ9GO And sorry  that I am not responding in Russian.  After being on the travel ban list to your country for 3 years, I have lost interest in maintaining my ability to speak/write Russian.  You government seems to really fear me these days. странно и жалькоhttps://t.co/8SRdSEvg5r After serving on Obama’s team, McFaul has re-invented himself as a network TV personality since 2016 with 280,000 Twitter followers, 106,000 of which are fake, according toTwitter audit. Who pays for it?USAID are big backers, throwing in a seven-figure annual sum. This, of course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don’t agree with their government’s policies as Russian agents. The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia’s Defense Ministry. Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google. While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved. Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled ‘The Institute for the Promotion of War’. Unlike the others, it doesn’t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East. However, Moscow’s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs. What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression. It supported the Iraq ‘surge’ and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan. IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran. Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella,  called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran. US occupation of Damascus -@TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria. This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad's government as well as Iranian and Russian influence.pic.twitter.com/nmSTkSzb5G Who are its people?Kimberly Kagan is the brains behind this operation. She’s married to Frederick Kagan, who was involved in the neocon ‘Project for the New American Century’ group along with his brother, Robert Kagan. Which makes Kimberly the sister-in-law of Victoria“f**k the EU”Nuland. Another lobbyist is Ukrainian Natalia Bugayova, who was involved in Kiev’s 2014 EuroMaidan coup. She previously worked for the Kiev Post, a resolutely anti-Russian newspaper which promotes US interests in Ukraine. However, IFTSOW’s most notorious lobbyist was Elizabeth O’Bagy, who emerged as a ‘Syria expert’ in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups. She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW. Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain. O’Bagy has alsocollaboratedwith the Atlantic Council’s Michael Weiss, which is further evidence of how tight-knit the world of US neoconservative advocacy really is. Who pays for it?Predictably, Raytheonhas openedits wallet. Meanwhile, other US military contractors like General Dynamics and DynCorp are also involved. L3, which provides services to the US Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and government intelligence agencies is another backer along with Vencore, CACI and Mantech.

"30 Jan, 2018",Oliver Stone leads tributes to Robert Parry as shady US lobbyists PropOrNot dance on his grave,"The anonymous anti-Russia lobby group PropOrNot has stunned social media users with an outrageous attack on the memory of Robert Parry, the crusading journalist who died last weekend. Clearly forgetting the usual convention by which polite society never“speaks ill of the dead,”the smear-merchants weren’t willing to bury their enmity towards the writer, even in the immediate aftermath of his untimely death. “He is, no doubt, hot-bunking it in hell with Lord Haw-Haw. Good riddance,”the activists wrote, after accusing Parry of“spreading lies in the service of brutally corrupt regimes that are at war with us.” This completely wrong story is an appropriate tribute to Robert Parry's legacy of spreading lies in the service of brutally corrupt regimes that are at war with us.He is, no doubt, hot-bunking it in hell with Lord Haw-Haw. Good riddance.https://t.co/polGXBBb5m Not content with those ungracious words, the obsessives escalated matters with a follow-up tweet. “Robert Perry died mad about the fact that people were calling him what he was. The truth is poison for a guilty mind,”they wrote, neglecting to spell his surname correctly. Robert Perry died mad about the fact that people were calling him what he was. The truth is poison for a guilty mind. This is a great example of Robert Perry's Putinist lies:https://t.co/0WniTswfsg Meanwhile, on Tuesday Hollywood legend Oliver Stone dropped a touching tribute to his late friend. The three-time Oscar winneropinedhow Parry’s passing“leaves a giant hole in American journalism.” In honor of Robert Parry, read a collection of his work curated by the CIAhttps://t.co/HibHoe4luPvia@muckrock “As audiences, we're inundated with the surface of events but seem unable to interpret them correctly; with intelligent, common-sense repetition (not the continual Russia-bashing of NY Times and WaPo), we learn and remember,”the‘Wall Street’and‘JFK’director wrote.There's a critical need for Parry's Consortium News to continue as a foundation for progressive, independent journalism. I hope, as the years go, you'll follow and contribute to this legacy and come to appreciate its importance in our present condition.” Stone also paid tribute to Parry’s bravery, noting how“to my mind, he exists now alongside I.F. Stone, Drew Pearson, George Seldes, Gary Webb, and others as seekers of truth at the steep price you seem to have to pay to follow your common sense and your integrity when they are in direct opposition to the tyranny of mainstream media conformity.” PropOrNot was made famous when the Washington Postlegitimizedits agenda in late 2016 by reporting its (evidence-free) findings that  around 200 US alternative-media outlets were operating on behalf of“Russian Propaganda.”The Post’s role in the outrage was widely slammed. The Interceptdescribedit as“McCarthyite”, and Rolling Stone as“shameful anddisgusting,”while the New Yorkerclassifiedit as“propaganda”in itself. The Washington Post later tried to distance itself from the organization, appending an“Editor's Note”to its piece in response to the widespread criticism. For its part, PropOrNot refuses to reveal the identities of its operatives, only stating that around 40 individuals are involved. This is a statement that has to betakenwith a pinch of salt, much like blogosphere speculation about the smear artists’ alleged ties to the Washington establishment. PropOrNot wasn’t alone in anonymously showing disdain for Parry. The Twitter account‘Soviet Sergey’weighed in with“good, he was a vile liar.”While a“parody”account wouldn’t usually merit mention,  this one has been heavilypromotedby Jakub Janka of the George Soros-backed‘European Values’in Prague. The activist regularly includes it alongside figures such as Times of London columnistEdward Lucas, Atlantic Council lobbyist BenNimmoand Washington Post columnist AnneApplebaumin his tweets. Parry was born in 1949 in Connecticut and worked for the Associated Press, PBS and Newsweek. Hewona George Polk Award in 1984 for his stories on how the CIA helped the so-called contras, right-wing rebels who were fighting the socialist government in Nicaragua. The journalist later revealed the involvement of National Security Council officer Oliver North in a clandestine operation to support the same contras with revenues from secret arms sales to Iran. However, by 1995, he’d become disillusioned with the mainstream media and established the Consortium for Independent Journalism. Robert Parry, editor and publisher ofhttps://t.co/AlnCfvls8X, died peacefully Saturday evening. In this tribute, his son Nat Parry describes Robert’s unwavering commitment to independent journalism.https://t.co/0vYHU0FUpV “The people who succeeded and did well”in the popular press, hetoldmedia watchdog group Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting in 1993,“were those who didn’t stand up, who didn’t write the big stories, who looked the other way when history was happening in front of them, and went along either consciously or just by cowardice with the deception of the American people.” Bryan MacDonald, for RT Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article described Edward Lucas as an Economist Editor. However, Mr. Lucas is no longer employed at that magazine, which he was associated with for many years. We were happy to correct the record.

"26 Jan, 2018","Soros accuses Trump of seeking ‘mafia state,’ pledges to devote efforts to Europe & US","Billionaire George Soros says he will now devote his efforts to Europe and the US as he believes their ‘open societies’ are in danger. He accused US President Donald Trump of wanting to create a ‘mafia state.’ “I find the current moment in history rather painful,”remarked financial speculator Soros, 87, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday. “Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin’s Russia, are on the rise. In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state but he can’t, because the Constitution, other institutions, and a vibrant civil society won’t allow it.” LIVE: George Soros is speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davoshttps://t.co/orWsFeFlGL Soros’ criticism of Trump comes as no surprise as he has been a longtime supporter of Clinton. Soros Fund Management donated $25 million to the Clinton campaign, a spokesperson told the New Yorker. This time last year Soros called Trump a“would-be dictator”and predicted he would fail. Soros has been the financial backer behind the progressive movement MoveOn. The Washington Postrevealedin 2004 that Soros and his wife, Susan Weber Soros, gave $1.46 million to the organization. Among theemails hackedfrom Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, and published by WikiLeaks, is a strategy document from Podesta’s think-tank, the Center for American Progress, that sought financial support from Soros for grassroots efforts. “I give President Trump credit for motivating his core supporters brilliantly, but for every core supporter he has created a greater number of core opponents who are equally strongly motivated. That is why I expect a Democratic landslide in 2018,”Soros said. ICYMI, RECORD: George Soros Spent SIXTEEN MILLION Dollars Opposing Donald Trump Last Yearhttps://t.co/U25Aj0qEjX Soros said previously his foundation has focuses on the so-called developing world, but“now that open society is also endangered here in the United States and Europe, we are spending more than half our budget closer to home because what is happening here is having a negative impact on the whole world.” Soros said there were grave dangers to be faced including the rise of authoritarianism in places like Hungary and that under Trump“the United States is set on a course toward nuclear war by refusing to accept that North Korea has become a nuclear power.” This refusal has created an incentive for North Korea“to develop nuclear capacity with all possible speed,”Soros argued, which in turn“may induce the United States to use its nuclear superiority preemptively”and start a nuclear war. The only solution he added was to“come to terms with North Korea as a nuclear power.” For decades Soros made his fortune as a speculator of currency and hedge-fund manager and has campaigned on the values of democracy, pluralism and individuals rights around the world through his Open Society Foundations. Some skeptics however say his funding has incited some of the color revolutions often leading to disorder and confusion. Soros said another of his goals is to help save the European Union, radically reinventing it by rethinking whether all members had to adopt the euro and adopting a multi-track approach of flexibility with countries forming coalitions to pursue particular goals rather than be dominated by a European bureaucracy.

"26 Jan, 2018","Trump to reverse Obama’s ‘closure’ of still open Gitmo, yet another Washington leak suggests","A leaked cable suggests President Donald Trump will order the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to “remain open.” It is the third leak in a single day regarding the Trump administration, as the president arrives in Davos, Switzerland. A draft State Department cable describes a preview of a plan by Trump to rescind President Barack Obama’s executive order to close Guantanamo Bay, according to a document obtained byPoliticoon Thursday. The leak comes hot on the heels of the president’s arrival at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leaked cable instructs US diplomats to start informing officials from other countries about the order after the president’s State of the Union speech, scheduled for January 30. However, embassies in Paris, London, Berlin and a number of other cities can begin telling foreign governments on Monday, Politico reported the cable as reading. The draft cable includes talking points designed to lighten the concerns of allies who are likely to criticize the president’s decision to keep the prison open, Politico reported. The document states that the alleged forthcoming decision will also repeal language from Obama’s 2009 executive order to the effect that any detainees in Guantanamo should be“returned to their home country, released, transferred to a third country, or transferred to another United States detention facility”at the time the prison shuts down. In addition to this, the cable also notes that Trump’s executive order will direct the US Department of Defense, in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, to“recommend criteria to the President for determining detention disposition outcomes for individuals captured on the battlefield.” However, the newly leaked document also says the Trump administration is“not aware of any plans to bring additional detainees to Guantanamo Bay.” “The EO does not signal a significant policy shift with respect to detentions,”the cable says.“Rather, it affirms Guantanamo Bay will continue to remain open and serve as one of several options the United States maintains for the detention of terrorists.” The expected decision follows two other leaks on Thursday regarding the Trump White House. The New York Times alleged that last June Trump called for White House counsel Don McGahn to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, now leading the Trump-Russia probe into alleged election collusion, based on four anonymous sources. However, McGahn reportedly refused and threatened to resign if the firing was carried out, at which point the president allegedly backed out of the decision. McGahn’s threat to resign was not made directly to the president, the Times reported citing sources. READ MORE: Soros warns Trump may destroy ‘our entire civilization’ over North Korea Also on Thursday, a one-page White Housememoconcerning US immigration policy changes was leaked by a congressional source after it was delivered to Congress. The memo outlines Trump’s plan for a bipartisan immigration reform deal, which calls for the termination of chain migration and visa lotteries, but grants a pathway to citizenship for more than double the number of“Dreamers”that Democrats most recently pushed. Trump’s plan would give 1.8 million illegal immigrants, including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and those who are DACA-eligible, a path to citizenship over 10-12 years.

While laying into Trump, who is also in Davos for the forum, Soros mentioned the current drama unfolding between North Korea and the US. The billionaire said Trump’s handling of the situation with North Korea is moving the US towards nuclear war, because it is unwilling to accept North Korea as a new nuclear power. Soros added that US actions against the small Far East country“creates a strong incentive for North Korea to develop its nuclear capacity with all possible speed.”Such a rapid development could“induce the United States to use its nuclear superiority preemptively, in effect to start a nuclear war to prevent a nuclear war.” Soros called this possible move by the US“a self-contradictory strategy,”CNBC reports. However, Soros didn’t stop there on the dangers of Trump’s presidency. “Not only the survival of open society but the survival of our entire civilization is at stake,”he said, CNBC reports.“The rise of leadership such as Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States have much to do with this.” Soros even gave his advice on how to thwart a nuclear war by suggesting a“carrot and stick”approach, in which North Korea is rewarded by the US for holding off on developing its nuclear weapons further than it already has. Soros also predicted that Trump’s stint in the White House may not last a full term. “Clearly I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world,”Soros said.“But I regard it as a purely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020 or even sooner.” The billionaire investor said he expects a“landslide”win by the Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, theStraits Times reports.

Mueller is overseeing the probe into alleged ties between Trump and Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The announcement came even after Trump said he was not considering such a move.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"18 Jan, 2018","Soros predicts EU breakdown, calls Russia ‘resurgent power’","George Soros has lamented that the European Union is on the verge of collapse while Russia is becoming “a resurgent nationalist power.” Hungarian-American tycoon George Soros, who runs the $26 billion Soros Fund Management and chairs the global board of the Open Society Foundations (OSF), made the remarks while speaking to theFinancial Times. Soros claimed nationalism has now become the“dominant ideology in the world,”taking aim at the 28-member European Union.“It’s the EU that’s the institution that’s on the verge of a breakdown,”he asserted.“And Russia is now the resurgent power, based on nationalism.” In Russia, Soros’ organizations werebannedin 2015 by authorities citing security threats they posed to the country. In his native Hungary, Soros is thought to be plotting against the government of hardline rightwing politician Viktor Orban. Prime Minister Orban believes Soros has been creating a low-key network to undermine his cabinet and influence EU policies in Brussels. Hungary’s leader has consistently accused Soros of fueling the refugee crisis in Europe and eroding European cultural identity. In October last year, the Prime Minister said more than 200 members of the European Parliament are listed by the billionaire’s“empire”as“friends to the network.” Orban, who will seek a fourth term as Hungary’s Prime Minister next year, said he has directed the country’s secret services to investigate the“Soros Empire”and“expose it to the public.” Earlier that year, Soros labelled Hungary a“Mafia state,”prompting Orban to fire back:“The only network which operates in mafia ways, which is not transparent in Hungary is the Soros network.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"12 Jan, 2018",The Panama Chronicles: How America’s enemies were targeted,"The Panama Papers exploded in the media last April, revealing the extent of offshore wealth hidden by celebrities and politicians. RT’s latest documentary explores who was behind the leak and how it was framed in the media. More than 11.5 billion documents from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca were stolen by an anonymous person known as John Doe. The tranche featured information on 130,000 people and was given to two journalists from the German Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) newspaper. SZ started to work with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which put 370 journalists across the world on the case for a year. ICIJ is part of the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) and both organizations are based in the same Washington DC building, just a few blocks from the White House, the documentary reports. The CPI is financed by the George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, the Carnegie Foundation and others. This tie has some questioning the motives behind how the documents were framed. “The problem with Panama Papers is that the initial release targeted the enemies of the United States,”Bradley Birkenfeld, an American banker and whistleblower, said.“This is the way the CIA operates – they operate in a scheme in which they try to undermine their enemy with information that will either embarrass them or destroy their career.” Panama Papers: 'Biggest leak in history' on corruptionhttps://t.co/jpM8MJdG8zpic.twitter.com/fCNQF2dPN9 Julian Assange’s lawyer, Greg Barns, questioned why the ICIJ didn’t release more information from the documents.“What happened was it was politicized very early,” he said. “It became an anti-Russia story, an anti-any-government-the-West-doesn’t-like story. That was the focus, and that should not have been the focus of the story.” The Panama Papers revealed the Icelandic Prime Minister David Gunnlaugsson Sigmundur’s wife’s offshore accounts, resulting in his resignation. Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron’s father was also revealed to be a customer of the controversial bank. #ParadisePapers: New offshore leaks mention Queen Elizabeth, Trump & Putinhttps://t.co/8kmyyvxRvOpic.twitter.com/HjoRWQx94x No Americans were exposed in the release, while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name dominated international headlines when the story first broke. Although Putin didn’t appear in the documents, he was tied to the release through friends of his who were named in the reports. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Syrian President Bashar Assad appeared in media reports, despite not being mentioned in any documents. The pair were tied to the release through their brother-in-law and cousins, respectively. The Panama Chronicles examines how the ICIJ chose which documents to highlight, and questions both the funding and motives behind the international organization. A mere 5 percent of the documents were released, suggesting another batch could soon emerge. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"19 Dec, 2017",Newsweek’s claim Putin is planning World War 3 is completely fake,"Newsweek has again proven that if the Kremlin really wants to discredit Western media, all it needs to do is translate articles about Russia from the mainstream press and distribute them free of charge across the country.

Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail.

Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Halloween may have been almost two months ago, butNewsweekhas held back the horror until Christmas: “PUTIN is PREPARING for WORLD WAR III… YEAH, THAT’S BAD NEWS,” it bellows in its latest cover story, with capital letters sprinkled around to make things extra scary. The whole setup screams “get them to the nuclear shelter now” because big bad Vlad (sic) is going to unleash hell. Except, he’s not. And Newsweek knows he’s not. We know this because the shower of amateurs who run the piss-poor magazine have exaggerated a lengthy diatribe based on a conversation with a single named source. And who is this prophet of doom? Is it a high-ranking whistleblower from inside the Kremlin or perhaps even General Gerasimov himself, armed with his“doctrine?”No, instead it’s a columnist for a Russian opposition newspaper, who used to work for a lobby group in the United States, which has beenaccusedof spreading anti-Russian propaganda by the foreign ministry in Moscow. It’s all so depressingly predictable. But it’d be funny if it wasn’t so serious. Can we imagine the pitch, for a moment? It must have gone something like this: Owen Matthews (the author): “Good morning, editor, I have a huge scoop. You see, Putin is preparing for World War Three. Editor:“Wow, Owen, that’s amazing. What are your sources?” Matthews: “Well, I have two unnamed British guys who are not authorized to speak, so you will have to take my word on it, and a Russian bloke who writes for the Novaya Gazeta paper, which publishes three times a week.” Editor: “That sounds legit, Owen. It’s so well researched that I am going to make it the cover story.” And this is a prime example of how pathetic Western media coverage of Russia is right now. We get half-cocked stories, quite obviously made to suit the agenda of newsdesks in London, New York, and Washington. Usually based on obscure or anonymous sources. In the past month, we’ve already had two classic examples of shambolic and embarrassing reportage. The UK Independentwasfirst out of the blocks, promoting a threadbare ‘scoop,’ based on a Moscow rumor, about how Vladimir Putin was ""tired"" and ""considered leaving the presidency:” it was published a few weeks before he announced his intention to run for another six-year term. And then Foreign Policy’s Moscow correspondentmoanedthat it was impossible to cultivate sources in Russia before the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out that she’d never even tried to contact their press secretary since receiving accreditation. #Zakharova: Since receiving accreditation,@Amie_FRhas never used any of the aforementioned means to contact the Russian Foreign Ministrypic.twitter.com/fV1uWPYl7I While those two incidents can be put down to incompetence, and reporters being out of their depth, Newsweek has jumped the shark completely. They offer no evidence that Russia is planning for World War Three, save for a few lines from Pavel Felgenhauer, who used to write for the Moscow Times and has beenassociatedwith America’s Jamestown Foundation. Felgenhauer is no Nostradamus either. You see, back in 2008, hetoldGerman state-broadcaster Deutsche Welle that Moscow would be dragged into “a prolonged and difficult war” after Mikhail Saakashvili invaded South Ossetia because “it's a logistical nightmare to try to take South Ossetia back from Georgia's quite good military.” But, ultimately, it took Moscow’s forces just two days to remove all Georgian soldiers from the restive province. As it happens, Newsweek, since its 2014 reincarnation, hasconsistentlypublished nonsense stories about Russia. A prime example coming in the summer of 2015, when theyallegedMoscow was helping east Ukrainian rebels to build a “dirty bomb.” A widelydebunkedpiece of piffle the magazine has never retracted. And, incidentally, the author now handles communications at George Soros’ Open Society, which tells its own tale. So, what’s behind Newsweek’s incessant anti-Russia stance, and its reliance on poorly researched articles to drive home its agenda? Perhaps it’s related to an unusual partnership with NATO’s Atlantic Council adjunct. Because, for the past couple of years,Newsweekhas beenpublishingadvertorials from the notoriouslyRussophobiclobby group. As it happens, the Atlantic Council’s activities arefundedby military contractors Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Raytheon Company; the Ukrainian World Congress and United States Department of State. In other words, the very same sort of entities which benefit, in terms of relevance or profits, from presenting Russia as a threat. Just fancy that!

"18 Dec, 2017",Soros-backed group plans nationwide protest in event of Mueller’s firing,"A group backed by billionaire George Soros is planning nationwide “take to the streets” protests if President Donald Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas. Trump said he isn’t considering the move. “This is our moment to stand up to protect our democracy. Let’s mobilize to show that we won’t let Donald Trump become the authoritarian that he aspires to be,”MoveOn.org said on itswebsiteabout the protests.“The law applies to all of us, and it’s essential that it also applies to the most powerful people in our country.” MoveOn dot org is behind the push to “take to the streets” if Mueller firedpic.twitter.com/6XBkhUYEnc The organizer said firing the special counsel“would be a constitutional crisis for our country”and would“demand an immediate and unequivocal response to show that we will not tolerate abuse of power from Donald Trump.” While MoveOn.org is primarily funded by small-dollar contributions from its millions of members, major contributors in the past included financier George Soros and Peter B Lewis, chief executive of Progressive Corp. Soros gave $1.46 million to the group’s Voter Fund during the 2004 election cycle. #MarchForTruthhas joined forces with@moveon,@IndivisibleTeam,@CommonCause,@Public_Citizenand many other partners to prepare a rapid response if Donald Trump fires Robert Mueller. We have 80,000 RSVPs to 500 events in all 50 states. ➡️ Join us:https://t.co/CHSA5DG2hapic.twitter.com/iyscF3PYEq After returning from the White House from Camp David on Sunday, Trump was asked by reporters if he was considering dismissing the special counsel, after it was revealed Mueller had obtained access to thousands of emails exchanged by officials of Trump’s transition team. “No, I am not,”the president said. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department’s Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties of Trump’s campaign associates to Russia. In October, Mueller indicted Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates for several counts of tax fraud and conspiracy. The charges have nothing to do with Manafort’s campaign work, but involve his lobbying work for the Ukrainian government. Earlier this month, Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the content of his conversations with the Russian ambassador six weeks after the election. #Trump: I had to fire#Flynnbecause he lied to VP &#FBIhttps://t.co/Vhq79Uzpphpic.twitter.com/M873aeegoR The General Service Administration had improperly provided the transition records to Mueller’s team, Trump’s general counsel Kory Langhofer said in a letter to congressional committee chairs. The emails in question were provided to Mueller's team in September, in response to requests from the FBI, but the transition team didn't learn about it until last week, Langhofer said in a letter sent to the House Oversight and Senate Homeland Security committees, calling the disclosure“unauthorized.”A copy of the letter was obtained by the AP. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland), the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, dismissed the transition's arguments that GSA shouldn't have turned over the records. President Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no plans to fire Mueller. That hasn’t stopped elected officials such as Representative Jackie Speier (D-California), who claimed onKQEDon Friday that Republicans are trying to shut down the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections. “I believe the President wants all of this shut down,”Speier said when asked if she believe House Republicans were bowing to pressure from the White House.“The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make significant speech at the end of the next week. And on December 22, when we are out of DC, he was going to fire Robert Mueller.” Speier said if Trump did that, it“would cause a constitutional crisis,”and“without a doubt there would be an impeachment effort.” A spokeswoman for Speier said the congresswoman shared the rumor to put pressure on Trump not to fire Mueller.

"22 Nov, 2017",Duma committee backs bill to block ‘undesirable’ foreigners from entering Russia,"The Russian lower house Committee for Legislative Work has approved a bill that would allow parliament to ban foreigners from entering the country if they are deemed a threat to Russia’s security or its values. The bill allows either chamber of the Russian parliament to issue entry bans for foreign citizens who either threaten national interests or “infringe upon the interests of a person, society or state as well as the national, historic, spiritual culture or any other values that are commonly recognized in Russia.” The legislation was initially drafted in November 2014 by a group of lawmakers headed by a representative of the parliamentary majority party United Russia. It specifies that the restrictions on entering the country must be commensurate with the benefits or restrictions introduced by the relevant foreign state with regard to Russian citizens. An amendment to the law on border control is included in the bill, which allows the government to introduce specific rules on entering and exiting the country as a reciprocal step to similar decisions made by foreign nations. The State Duma Committee for Legislative Work called the bill “timely” and said that it did not contradict the Constitution, existing Russian laws or international treaties signed by Russia. In June 2015, Russia introduced the so-called Law on Undesirable Foreign Organizations, which allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to draw up an official list of undesirable foreign organizations. Once a group is recognized as undesirable, its assets in Russia must be frozen, its offices closed, and the distribution of any of its materials must be banned. If the ban is violated, the personnel of the outlawed group and any Russian citizens who cooperate with them could face heavy fines, or even prison terms in the case of repeated or aggravated offences. About a month after the law came into force, Russia’s upper house released a list of foreign organizations that it planned to declare undesirable. The list consisted of 12 entries, including such groups as the National Democratic Institute, the US National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Institute, which is also known as the Soros Foundation. The placement of these groups on the list was subsequently implemented by the Justice Ministry. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"17 Nov, 2017",Soros and his ‘226 EU friends’ thrust into spotlight by Farage – so who are they?,"Picking up the anti-Soros torch from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, UK politician Nigel Farage is seeking to investigate fellow EU MEPs who support the controversial vision of the wealthy financier. But are Orban and Farage’s fears valid? UK politician Nigel Farage, the prominent face of Brexit, is now concerned about Europe’s destiny. Addressing the EU Parliament this week, Farage provided some thoughtful ideas as to the source of the claims that Russia had somehow manipulated the Brexitvote, as well as the Trumpelection. “Just last week, the electoral commission, in the UK, launched an investigation to find out whether the ‘Leave’ campaign took offshore money or Russian money,”Farage said. ""This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organization called Open Society.” But Farage, who seems to take great delight in agitating his fellow MPs, was just warming up. He went on to provide yet another example of an EU parliamentarian working on behalf of George Soros, this time against Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, who hasaccusedthe financier of seeking to create“a Europe of mixed population.” “We even had last week Mr. [Guy] Verhofstadtlobbyingon behalf of Mr. Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary,”Farage said, pointing directly at Verhofstadt as he spoke. “I wonder,”Farage continued,“when we are talking about ‘political collusion,’ I wonder if we are looking in the wrong place.” FaragedescribedSoros’s influence in Strasbourg and Brussels as“truly extraordinary.”And that influence looks set to increase dramatically now that Soros has donated the bulk of his wealth - $18 billion - into his Open Society pet project, which campaigns for open borders and supranational structures such as the European Union. Farage concluded his short, fiery monologue with a weighty statement:“I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international, political collusion in history.” On the surface, there seems to be some legitimacy to Farage’s claim. According to public sources, Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of Open Society Foundations, met with members of the European Commission on 44 separateoccasionsin 2016. And now that the organization has just been energized with $18 billion, it would seem apparent that that influence is set to increase. Moreover, the Soros organizations published a pamphlet providing details on a list of 226 reliable“friends”who serve in the European Parliament. Farage said he would call on the parliament to set up a special committee to investigate the issue. In a 177-page pamphletpublishedby Open Society, entitled“Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014-2019),”226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views. According to the pamphlet,“The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support Open Society’s work. Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, “reliable allies” of George Soros hold at least one-third of seats.""  So what sort of qualifications does an MEP need to be included among Open Society’s “reliable allies?” A quick preview of the candidate’s description field provides some good indication as to what Soros expects from his allies, including a political philosophy that includes support of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or intersex) movement, open borders and an anti-Russia stance. Among the 226 chosen, there is one Yana Toom, an MEP from Estonia, who comes in for a bit of criticism despite her inclusion.“Refused supporting the European Parliament’s first resolution on the Ukraine-Russia conflict in July 2014, and may be pro-Russia to an unknown extent (and, in that case, not necessarily an Open Society).” For anyone who questions whether Open Society works directly against Russian interests, that single line should dispel all doubts. Moreover, it provides some background as to why Russia in 2015 banned Open Society from operating on its territory due to the threat itposedto the country’s“constitutional order.” Another MEP on the list, Monica Macovei of Romania, serves as something like the golden mean for star-studded Soros status. “Resolutely progressive; unquestionable ally of Open Society values; does not hesitate to go against her group’s instructions; however, can sometimes be described as a loose cannon with her own, uncompromising set of priorities.” When reading such an assessment, one might get the mistaken impression that the European Parliament is designed to serve the will of George Soros and his highly controversial agenda, as opposed to the will of the European peoples. To say that George Soros, who was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, has an influence on the global scene, would be the understatement of the century. His excessive wealth allows him to finance a veritablearmy of organizations, many serving at cross purposes. Indeed, Soros, 87, has been connected to movements and civil disturbances as diverse as distanced asBlack Lives Mattermovement in the US, to the Maidanuprisingin Ukraine. And nowhere has Soros’s influence been more felt than in the ongoing European debate over migrants.It looks like the European refugee crisis, which has been blamed on the Syrian civil war, would not occur in its current intensity without the direct assistance of the Open Society Foundation. Thanks to the advocacy work of the Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM), both Soros-sponsored organizations, the mass resettlement of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa into Europebecamethe norm. In fact, it appeared that the so-called“Merkel Plan”– the deal struck by the EU and Turkey – was the brainchild of the European Stability Initiative,“in addition to the largesse of George Soros’ foundations,”F. William Engdahlwrotein the Near Eastern Outlook. Considering that the massive influx of Muslim migrants threatens to change the face of“Christian Europe”forever, and without any vote on the matter by the people of Europe, perhaps it is time to see exactly what kind of direct influence George Soros and his Open Society Foundation are having on European parliamentarians. After all, these are not the play toys of any one individual, but the representatives of an entire state. George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state. This is where the real international political collusion is.pic.twitter.com/ANXOII7SFY Robert Bridge, for RT @Robert_Bridge RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"16 Nov, 2017",Magnitsky Act mastermind seeks to stop Cyprus from revealing his offshore assets to Russia,"A group of MEPs have urged Cyprian authorities not to cooperate with Russia on an inquiry against the man behind the Magnitsky Act, William Browder. Now, a Russian lawyer claims that Browder himself arranged this petition to hide data on his operations. Browder, a US-born British investor and the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, fears that his fraudulent investment schemes involving offshore assets in Cyprus would be revealed to European authorities if Cyprus continues to cooperate with Moscow on its probe against him, Natalya Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who conducted her own investigation into Browder's operations, told RT. She added that Browder is actively trying to paint the investigation against him as politically motivated.  “He [Browder] is afraid of the Russian probe that has conclusive evidence of his financial crimes and proof that his theory of Magnitsky’s death is an absolute fake. That’s why Browder is ready to stage any provocation,”Veselnitskaya said. She went on to say that the investor’s decision to intervene was particularly“influenced by the fact that the entire network of offshore companies that make up his organized criminal group is located on the territory of Cyprus.” The incident that Veselnitskaya was referring to took place in late October 2017. At that time, 17 members of the European Parliament appealed to Cypriot President Nikos Anastasiades in an open letter, in which they called on him to stop assisting Russia in its investigation against Browder. The MEPs particularly expressed their concerns over the fact that“the Cypriot government is actively assisting the Russian government in furthering human rights violations through assistance with politically motivated prosecutions, in contravention of its obligations under European conventions,”asreportedby the local Cyprus Mail daily. Even though the letter carried absolutely no legal weight and could not force Anastasiades to take any measures, the MEPs still sought to exert pressure on the Cypriot authorities by stating that“the conduct of Cyprus in this case will have implications that go far beyond this case.”The letter also explicitly stated that the investigation against Browder was of a“political nature.” “While every other European country, Interpol and the Council of Europe have deemed the Russian proceedings against Browder to be politically motivated, your country has taken a contrary position, and agreed to provide assistance to a Russian politically-motivated process, clearly in violation of your obligations under the rule of law,”the signatories to the letter said. Just weeks before the MEPs sent their letter to the Cypriot president, Browder himself filed a request to the court of Nicosia, asking for an emergency injunction against the transfer of any data concerning his activities in the island country to Russia. According to Veselnitskaya, the letter and the application filed by Browder were“a double gambit by the criminal union between Browder and his lawyers: an attempt to interrupt the course of the investigation and interfere in the judicial process."" Notably, as many as 12 out of 17 European lawmakers who signed the letter, were mentioned in the so-called“Soros list”– a document prepared for the Open Society European Policy Institute, which itself is part of the Open Society Foundations run by the US investor and hedge fund manager George Soros. Thedocumentpublished on the Internet after the mail server of the Open Society Foundations was hacked in 2016 lists those, whom it calls“reliable allies in the European Parliament.” The letter's signatories who are also""reliable allies""of Soros include socialists Ana Gomes, Pier Antonio Panzeri, and Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar; member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group Monica Macovei; liberals Maite Pagazaurtundua Ruiz, Petras Austrevicius and Fredrick Federley; greens Rebecca Harms and Judith Sargentini; and members of the European People’s Party Christofer Fjellner, Lars Adaktusson, and Gunnar Hokmark. Two more signatories to the letter are Anna Fotyga and Sandra Kalniete, former foreign ministers of Poland and Latvia respectively, known for their initiatives to“counteract Russian influence”in Europe. In mid-October, even before the letter signed by the European lawmakers reached the Cypriot president, the Prosecution Office of Cyprus actually suspended cooperation with Russia on the investigation into the allegations against Browder. In particular, Cypriot authorities banned a Russian delegation from coming to the island in pursuit of the investigative procedures, citing the application filed by Browder, in which he claimed that the Russian investigation was politically motivated. The Russian Foreign Ministry suspected the Cypriot authorities' decision was influenced from abroad.“We have serious doubts regarding the legality of that decision, which was made public before the court issued a decision on Mr Browder’s action, as well as to whether Cyprus took the decision independently,”the ministrysaidin a statement. Browder became known for his role in the adoption of the so-called Magnitsky Act – the 2012 US regulation that imposes sanctions on Russian individuals and companies over alleged violations of human rights. Browder actively lobbied the act in the US and then also encouraged the European countries to follow suit and also imposed sanctions on Russia over alleged human rights violations. The investor, however, has a long history of animosity against Russia. In 2013, he was sentenced to nine years in prison in absentia for tax evasion. According to the 2013 court verdict, Browder together with his Russian auditor Sergey Magnitsky failed to pay over 552 million rubles in taxes (about $16 million). The businessman was also found guilty of illegally buying shares in the country’s natural gas giant Gazprom. According to the law enforcers, that cost Russia at least 3 billion rubles ($100 million). Magnitsky died in pre-trial custody in 2009 after being detained as part of investigation in Browder’s fraudulent financial schemes in Russia. His death allowed Browder to present the whole case as political persecution and lobby for the adoption of the Magnitsky Act in the US.

"14 Nov, 2017","Nigel Farage calls on EU to investigate George Soros funding, collusion","Nigel Farage says while Russia is accused of funding Britain’s ‘Leave’ campaign, financier George Soros’ recent $18 billion donation to pro-EU charity Open Society has escaped scrutiny. “This is where the real international political collusion is,” Farage says.

He told those MEPs he would be writing to them to establish whether they had accepted money or help from billionaire investor and liberal campaigner Soros. “If we’re going to have a debate, and talk about full, political and financial transparency, well let’s do it.  So I shall be writing today to all 226 of you, asking some pretty fair questions: Have you ever received funds directly or indirectly from Open Society? How many of their events have you attended? Could you please give us a list of all the representatives including George Soros?” He is also calling on the European Parliament to set up a special committee to look into the issue.“I say this at a time when the use of money and the implications it may have had on the Brexit result or the Trump election has reached virtual hysteria. “Just last week, the Electoral Commission launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money. This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, someone linked to an organization called ‘Open Society.’” In October, Soros transferred the“bulk of his wealth”to Open Society, it confirmed. Writing on his website, the financier said:“My success in the financial markets has given me a greater degree of independence than most other people. This allows me to stand on controversial issues: in fact, it obliges me to do so because others cannot.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"13 Nov, 2017",How George Soros’ people enlisted me as a ‘foot-soldier in the fight against Putin’,"There I was minding my own business last Friday afternoon when a bunch of lobbyists in Prague suddenly enlisted me as “a foot-soldier in the fight against Putin.” As Queen Victoria probably didn’t say, “we are not amused."" Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv In Russia, they have a wonderful phrase: “Скажи мне кто твой друг и я скажу кто ты,” which roughly translates as “tell me who is your friend and I'll tell you who you are.” And it’s a sentiment which contains plenty of logic. So you can just imagine my discomfort when, the misleadingly named, “European Values,” a George Soros’ funded pressure group, pretended that I’d signed up to something called the“Prague Declaration”alongside a motley crew of anti-Russia opportunists. The “Prague Declaration” is a long-winded thing, so I’ll sum it up in six words: “liberal Western states, good; Russia bad.” Now you’ve got the gist, here are some of the signatories,describedas “European and American security experts and parliamentarians from 22 countries,” by NATO’s Atlantic Council adjunct. I want to congratulate@MarkSleboda1and@27khvon seeing the light and joining the likes of Bumfrey McDoogle. The School of Hard Knox hires only the best.https://t.co/c1aHeJuVoYpic.twitter.com/0yeKJ65ljs Bill Browder, the controversial financier, features and is joined by Yevhen Fedchenko, a Ukrainian activist who recentlysuggestedall Russian journalists were embedded with the state security apparatus. Meaning, even people working for anti-Kremlin outlets, who have grievances with Vladimir Putin’s administration. Another signatory is James Kirchick, a neocon who hasthreateneda military coup against President Donald Trump and he’s allied himself with Molly McKew, a key figure in what""The American Interest""dubs the“Russian Interference Racket”in the US. The misery doesn’t end there because John Schindler, a former spook-turned-conspiracy theorist, and ally ofLouise Mensch, is also on board. Presumably to provide buzzwords such as deza, short for dezinformatsiya (disinformation), orChekist, an old Russian term for the Soviet secret police. Meanwhile, another questionable entry is one Bumfrey McDoogle, who apparently represents the“School of Hard Knox.”An entity that sounds about as academically legitimate as this ""think tank,"" to be fair. It's field trip time, peeps. Taking the fight to the Chekists. Keep Cheeto Jesus in line while I'm on the road. Don't let#TeamDezawin. Bumfrey’s inclusion tells you all you need to know about“European Values.”Because despite his considerable largesse, poor old Soros has managed to recruit a bunch of rank amateurs to push his agenda. A collection of clowns, who only a few weeks ago, somehow confused RT presenter Larry King with the comedian Larry David and believed an actor impersonating Boris Johnson, was the real UK foreign secretary. Another thing I find offensive about the lobby group is their attempt to appropriate the idea of what ‘European values’ actually represent. Because, most Europeans would agree with the late Charles De Gaulle on this, who spoke of“Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'à l’Oural.”Meaning one “Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals."" That is, the entire continent united, with Russia, as its largest country, a major stakeholder. And that’s the kind of Europe most smart people want to see. But Soros and his lackeys have hijacked these sensible ideals to promote Atlanticism, which primarily serves American interests and those of liberal global capitalism. Indeed, these imposters desire a Europe, entirely subservient for Washington, with no independent foreign policy. In other words, they demand a unipolar world, dictated by a country which last year elected an unqualified man-child as its president. A figure almost completely neutered by the neocon-dominated American establishment, who, surely out of his own frustration, has now resorted to name calling foreign leaders on Twitter. Well, thanks, but no thanks, folks. But back to why I apparently joined the likes of Bill Browder (incidentally neither a security expert nor a parliamentarian), Molly McKew, James Kirchick and their colleague Bumfrey McDoogle on this particular wall of shame? My guess is they mixed up their ‘official’ list with some internal smear-laden trial run they had put together. Let’s be clear, theselobbyistshad a reason to be angry with me. Because, after all, only two weeks ago, here on RT, I exposed how Soros was responsible for at least 25 percent of their cash pile in 2015, which was cleverly obscured by listing different Open Society Foundation agencies. As it happens, other paymasters include the US and British embassies in Prague. And, in the same piece, I also outlined how they were smearing 2,327 prominent guests of RT as“useful idiots:”including, Harrison Ford, Stephen Fry, Will.I.Am and even Mr. T. This“European Values”gang illustrate all that is toxic in the foreign policy“think tank”racket. Which, these days amounts to a succession of chancers giving each other faux-academic titles while taking hardline anti-Russian positions and waiting for Soros and US government moolah to roll in. Some are actually able to pull the routine off with reasonable competence. But the greenhorns in Prague are pretty much a bunch of buffoons, behaving like the Mr. Beans of agitprop. Soros could get better bang for his buck, elsewhere. But, thankfully, for those of us who oppose his worldview, he's wasting it on these jokers.

"11 Nov, 2017",Soros-backed ‘rank amateurs’ forge RT contributor’s signature under anti-Russia declaration,"RT columnist Bryan MacDonald, a Moscow professor, and the mysterious “Bumfrey McDoogle from the School of Hard Knox” are just some of the people that appeared on an anti-Kremlin petition by the increasingly gaffe-prone European Values think tank. The distinctly named ‘Prague Declaration’ addresses “the democratic West” and proposes “seven urgent steps” to be taken “to stop Russian aggression.” The paper, intended for “Western leaders such as EU High Representative Federica Mogherini,” is said to have been endorsed by “more than 100 European and American security experts and parliamentarians from 22 countries.” However, a closer look at the signatories reveal some odd exceptions among Moscow’s traditional adversaries, such as exiled businessman Bill Browder and former NSA analyst John Schindler. One such name is MacDonald, who is described incorrectly as a“former RTcorrespondent”and earnestly as a“foot soldier in the fight against Putin.” “I am offended,”MacDonald told RT with a smile.“I mean I certainly don’t wanna be in the same company with the likes of Bill Browder, or Yevhen Fedchenko, who recently said that all Russian journalists were embedded with the security apparatus. I definitely don’t want to be associated with James Kirchick, a neocon who wants perpetual war. I absolutely don’t want to be associated with Molly McKew, who used to lobby for Mikhail Saakashvili. And definitely I don’t want any connection with John Schindler, who is a former NSA spook, who I think frankly is quite mad in his coverage of Russia.” As well as MacDonald and McDoogle, the list featured Moscow State University lecturer and regular RT analyst Mark Sleboda, who is listed as working for the non-existent Center for Conservative Studies. Whether the names,now deleted, appeared as a result of administrative error, mischief, or just a plain desire to claim the authority of RT’s contributors is unclear, but their appearance raises serious questions about the credibility of the other listed signatories. “They must have had a real list and the joke list and just merged the two together,”MacDonald said.“I mean, come on, a ‘foot soldier in the fight against Putin’?! That is kind of stuff teenagers come up with, they are not credible.” READ MORE: ‘What next, jail me as a traitor?’ RT contributors hit back at ‘useful idiots’ list (VIDEO) “So I think this is really outrageous, but I won’t engage with these people… I could send a request and ask a clarification, but you are talking about rank amateurs here.

"8 Nov, 2017",How I sold out to the Putin-Soros-Murdoch conspiracy to destroy Western civilization,"I was delighted to find myself in the Top Ten (alright; top 15) of the European Values list of 2,326 “Useful Idiots” appearing regularly on RT shows, and thus legitimizing Vladimir Putin’s attempt to destroy Western civilization as we know it. Why delighted? Because it completes the set of conspiracies to which I can now be accused of belonging. They include: • The Putin Conspiracy, since I am regularly interviewed on Russia Today (and even worse, I now get paid towritefor RT!); • The Soros Conspiracy, since myresearch, has been funded by the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) which he established; • The Murdoch Conspiracy, since I appear every week on Sky News Australia withCarson Scott,and I used to get paid byNews Ltdto write a weekly column; and • The Alt-Right Conspiracy, since I’ve signed a book contract withVox Day’s publishing firm Castalia House. So not only am I a “useful idiot,” I’m a useful idiot for four contradictory conspiracies. Does that make me a double-double agent? READ MORE: NGO publishes names of 2,300+ RT guests, labels them ‘useful idiots who undermine Western democracy’ No, it makes me someone who’s quadruple pissed off with people who attempt to understand the world from the perspective of conspiracy theories in the first place. I don’t deny the existence of conspiracies: in fact, far from it, because they’re everywhere. What I do deny is the implicit assumption that the conspirators understand the system they’re attempting to manipulate. For example, I’ve heard plenty of conspiracy theorists assert that the 2008 financial crisis was caused by the Federal Reserve/George Soros (Hi George!)/Hedge Funds/Academic-Economists-Who-Peddle-The-Efficient-Markets-Hypothesis, and “they” profited from it. This implies “they” knew what “they” were doing. Pardon me, but I’ve met many of these protagonists—and in the case of academic economists, I’ve worked with them for 30 years. “They” don’t have a clue (except George). Even those that were actively conspiring—like many hedge funds during the subprime bubble were doing so on the basis of utterly deluded theories about how the system they were trying to game actually worked. Where apparent conspiracies did work, likeSoros’s puntagainst the British Pound decades ago, they did so because a CSP (Clever Sinister Person) bet against the conventional wisdom of others who thought they understood the system (and did not), rather than because the CSP set up the whole thing in the first place. As for the argument that I’m unwittingly playing into Vladimir Putin’s malevolent plans for Western democracy by being interviewed on RT, I have three rebuttals. The first and most important is that RT simply has better programs and better journalists than, for example, the BBC. I would gladly discuss issues such as what caused the 2008 economic crisis on the BBC, were I asked. But the BBC (and most other Western outlets that European Values and other conspiracy theorists think are superior to RT) just isn’t interested in the issues. With precisely two honorable exceptions, BBC programs and its journalists have only been interested in a story involving me when there was a personality angle to it. I have been interviewed by the BBC 11 times since I arrived in the UK in mid-2014. Only two interviews were motivated by the journalist’s or program’s genuine interest in my non-orthodox approach to economics: a HARDtalkinterviewin August 2016, and an interview byAlice Baxterin January 2016. Fully six were about my friendYanis Varoufakiswhen he was Greece’s finance minister. Two others were on November 3rd, 2016, about some news story that I’ve since forgotten. And my most recentinterviewon the BBC, on September 14th this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Northern Rock, was the clincher for me. That failure was the most significant financial event in the UK in almost eighty years: it was the firstbankrun since the Great Depression. I was pleased to be asked to discuss it on air, and I expected a serious treatment of it. Instead, the item consisted of a two-minute introduction by one presenter, and a three-minute exchange with another which rates as one of the most vacuous interviews I’ve experienced in forty-five years of being interviewed by journalists (my first was as a 19-year-old politically active student at the University of Sydney in 1972). I did my best to answer inane questions seriously, but as one member of my Patreon community commented, you could see my answers parting the journalist’s hair. That was a cruel remark, but frankly a fair one. Which raises the second riposte: why aren’t there shows that are interested in the in-depth analysis of economic issues on the BBC? Shows like the RT staples on which I was and continue to be interviewed regularly:Capital Account,the Boom Bust, theKeiser Report,Renegade Inc, the 7pm News with Bill Dod, andGoing Underground. It’s not because the programs were devised by dastardly Russian stooges: most of them were developed by independent broadcasters and pitched to a number of outlets. I know for a fact that at least one of these shows was pitched to the BBC before it was offered to RT. They weren’t interested, but RT was. This isn’t because the BBC—and most Western media outlets—were too highbrow for these programs: the opposite is more the case. The BBC and its commercial rivals seem more interested in infotainment than analysis, more concerned with filling time with fancy graphics and pretty (male and female) talking torsos, than in actually getting to grips with the serious economic issues in a seriously challenging world. The third rebuttal, which I’ll develop in more depth in a later column, is that if I can help strengthen Russia as a rival axis of power to the USA, then I think that’s a good thing. I’d rather have a bipolar (or tripolar) battle for global dominance between two (or more) Superpowers, than have a unipolar world with a single Superpower, led by a leader with a bipolar personality.

"7 Nov, 2017",Paradise Papers: ‘Sensationalist media making mountain out of molehill’,"Certain media outlets are trying to blow the so-called “Paradise Papers” story out of proportion for their own ends and get very excited over what they discern to be connections with Russia, says Keith Boyfield, research fellow at the Center for Political Studies. The“Paradise Papers,”a series of financial files were leaked on Sunday. It exposed where the world’s richest people and institutions are hiding their vast fortunes, neatly sidestepping their domestic tax systems in the process. Famous individuals, such as Britain's Queen Elizabeth, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and billionaire George Soros are included in the list. Joining them are music superstars Bono and Madonna who apparently made investments through companies in Malta and Bermuda. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has a stake in Navigator Holdings, which is a transportation partner of Russian petrochemical company Sibur, according to the papers. The businessman has rejected any illegal actions on his part. RT asked Boyfield why many media outlets are meticulously scanning the files, desperate for a political scoop. “This is sensationalist media – this is appearing in newspapers like The Guardian. And there was a tremendous amount of coverage on the BBC about this so-called Paradise Papers. It amazes me in many ways, because I have a lot of dealings with private equity companies and other international investors. These offshore centers are entirely legitimate operations.Private equity companies often base their operations out of places like Jersey or Bermuda, because it is a tax neutral location, and it avoids investors getting embroiled with lots and lots of tax authorities. So they are making a mountain out of a molehill,” he said. US Democrats are meanwhile clamoring for an inquiry into Ross’s business.According to Boyfield, “newspapers like The New York Times and I suspect some of the national networks in America have already made their mind up about Mr. Trump.” In his view, the newspapers are determined to try and “see Trump kicked out of office” and “are spending their waking days and nights trying to work on various strategies” to achieve that goal. These Paradise Papers, he said, is just the latest example of such attempts.A major investor in Twitter and Facebook, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, has financial ties to two Russian government-owned firms, according to the leaked files. - 120+ politicians- Nearly 100 corporations- Tax planning details- Offshore interests & activities& morehttps://t.co/F81jbOyuZrpic.twitter.com/nLX9SbEO0Y Boyfield argues that some media outlets “look on the Russians as a sort of boogeyman”.“They’ve kind of made their own conclusion before any of these so-called revelations came out about the Paradise Papers. They are trying to – you could argue – stich up a case against, for example, this Russian businessman, who is based in California who have been operating entirely legitimately from what I can see, as has Mr. [Wilbur] Ross,” he said. “In fact, he has made a point of saying that he has disclosed all his financial dealings to Congress and he divested those companies, where it was felt that it would be appropriate. His investments with companies operating in Russia, as he pointed out today, there will be no sanctions applied against them. It is entirely legitimate operation. But I think certain newspapers and media outlets are trying to blow this story out of proportion for their own ends,” he added. “They get very anxious about what they discern to be connections with Russia and they are keen to jump to certain conclusions,” Boyfield told RT.

"7 Nov, 2017",US looks to push Russia out of EU's energy market while American tankers ship Russian LNG to Europe,"Tankers run by US energy corporations are delivering liquefied natural gas (LNG) bought in Russia to the Antwerp Gas Terminal in Belgium, reports Belgian daily Le Soir, as part of an investigation based on the 'Paradise Papers' leak. On Sunday, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), reportedly financed through George Soros funds, released over 13 million documents from the world’s leading offshore law companies. The documents revealed that four cargo ships owned by Navigator Holdings bought gas produced by Russian petrochemical company Sibur. #Siburis 'a company not under sanction... just like any other company, period' -#WilburRosshttps://t.co/N2HrBITsUB#ParadisePapers The LNG was reportedly loaded at the Russian Baltic port of Ust Luga. The financial papers also revealed that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has a 35 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which is registered in the Marshall Islands. Earlier this year, the Russian envoy to the EU Vladimir Chizhov said the US wouldn’t be able to replace Russian gas on the European market even if it were free. Russia to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Asia amid US sanctions & cold shoulder from Poland & Lithuaniahttps://t.co/TOuL3EarPk The probe reveals the EU, which is actively building new LNG terminals to lessen its dependence on Russian natural gas, is currently purchasing Russian fuel but at a higher price and technically not from Russia. Washington seeks to effectively push Moscow out of the European gas market by particularly burying the Nord Stream2 gas pipeline project“with all sorts of legal decisions, instruments [and] sanctions,”Russia’s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in late September. Over the last year, the US has increased LNG shipments to Europe, but it still covers roughly only six percent of European LNG imports, challenged by Norway, Qatar and Algeria, and not even taking into account natural gas supplies through other pipelines.Meanwhile according to Gazprom, Russian share of the total European gas market reached some 34 percent last year. As a result, the US may be testing a new strategy to cut Europe off from Russian gas supplies. “US companies are ready to search for one-use solutions that bring some profit to them but make it difficult for other states to do business. That characterizes the whole American approach to trade,”said Vladimir Bruter, an expert from the International Institute of Humanitarian and Political Studies, as quoted by Russia’s federal news agency.  Middle-income households - in US shrank from 61% in 1971 to 50% today- in China grew from 5% in 2000 to 35% todayhttps://t.co/skRq5Bmr8B In June, Washington introduced a new round of restrictions on Russia’s banking and energy sectors. Apart from imposing new sanctions directly on Russian enterprises, the law also envisages penalties for individuals and entities for investing more than $5 million a year or $1 million at a time in Russian energy export projects. It could also impose penalties on companies providing Russian energy sector enterprises with services, technology or information support. In legal terms, the current situation is not breaking international or any other laws, but the results are yielding fruit for the US, according to the analyst.“Nothing personal, it is just business. Americans have bought Russian gas at a profit, and now they are selling it at a profit, concurrently trying to drive Moscow out of the energy market,”Bruter said.

"4 Nov, 2017",This week in Russophobia,"Russophobia: an intense and often irrational hatred for Russia (Collins English Dictionary) For the past few years, this unfortunate condition has been on the rise again on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching levels last seen during Joseph McCarthy’s heyday, back in the 1950s. Of course, the advent of social media has made it easier for sufferers to transmit the virus.  Welcome to an occasional series, “This Week in Russophobia,” where we will keep you abreast of the latest flame-ups. In an attempt to attack Little Englander Nigel Farage, The Guardian’s supersleuth Carole Cadwalldrwrotethat RT""was banned last week from Twitter.”But RT was never banned by Twitter, only RT advertising was (on atotally absurd premise).Props for eventual correction, but can we keep the screenshots in the “fake news” file? Katerina Kruk works for the George Soros-backed “European Values,” a Prague-based pressure group that recently confused Larry King and Larry David in a big report on RT. Kruk came to prominence as a social media cheerleader for Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan coup. This week shetweeted, in response to the death of a Chechen militant near Kiev:""a strong woman, unapologetic critic Putin.""Of course, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest the deceased was assassinated on Moscow’s orders, but who needs evidence when you can cry“Moscow”! When Interior Minister Arsen Avakov’s son was detained as part of a corruption probe, it was no surprise Moscow was pointed to, because everyone knows the idea of a Ukrainian politician’s family engaging in corruption is totally absurd. Especially given how Kiev’s public servants are noted for their probity and financial restraint :-| Having released a detailed official statement, the ministrysuggestedthat""certain foreign forces""are behind the troubles of the Ukrainian interior minister and his family members. A""hybrid war""is led against Kiev's reformers, the official body alleged, explaining that""fake news""targeted Arsen Avakov and his ministry’s efforts""to protect the state against Russian hybrid aggression.""The “blame Russia” game seems never out of fashion in Ukraine. Sexual misconduct is a terrible thing and we should take reports of such seriously… OR should we exploit them for political purposes? That whiff of exploitation came from the Guardian’s Martin Kettle as he inexplicably attempted to bring Russia into the sex scandal engulfing British Conservative MPs,tweeting“If I worked for Putin, I'd think that Tory spreadsheet was a good day's work.” Professor Godfrey Bloom, a former member of the European Union parliament, chimed in,addingthat Putin was also behind Brexit. This will surely be news to the 17.4 million Brits who voted to leave the EU. Mark Galeotti is what’s known as a “Russia watcher,” part of a group of mainstream pundits who usually do not live in Russia but pontificate on all aspects of life there. In the most-Guardianheadlineever, Galeotti proclaims that“Putin could yet save Britain from Brexit. […] The word of Russian ‘black cash’ financing the Leave campaigns is fast becoming a torrent. As the inquiries pile up, hard evidence could delegitimize the EU referendum.”Hmmm, yes. While we’re waiting for said“hard evidence,”Galeotti fails to mention a large power that definitely interfered in Brexit, and one that the Guardian is a fan of! Former US President Barack Obama literally flew to England totellpeople how to vote in their referendum. A move the Guardian described as“friendly.”Hmmm again. On the flip side, as the Twitterthreadfrom journalist Mike Hind outlines:“the foreign dark money for Brexit was American.

"25 Oct, 2017",‘RT is accused & guilty of providing content that appeals to people’,"People wouldn’t be watching RT if it was not providing high quality news content and a much-needed alternative viewpoint amid a mainstream media monopoly, media experts have told RT, noting that baseless criticism only fuels the channel’s popularity. On Monday, the New York Times (NYT) accused YouTube of having a“cozy”relationship with RT, and which the publication believes, has contributed to the rise of the RT’s popularity on the world’s most visited video sharing site. Thearticleclaims that YouTube has played a“crucial role”in helping RT expand and significantly grow its audience base. ‘Unacceptable!’ RT pulled from YouTube prime ad list in US without notice “They had to attribute it to some form of collaboration or weird dealings because they couldn’t just accept that RT is doing well by providing people [with] content that people will watch,”Matteo Bergamini, the founder of independent youth news platform Shout Out UK, told RT. Independent journalist Derrick Droze agreed that the only thing the NYT succeeded in doing with its latest piece, is in fact, praising RT’s quality content and efficient partnership with YouTube. “It is kind of silly to see the New York Times and US government take this position because essentially what they are accusing RT of doing is knowing how to work YouTube, and knowing how to work algorithms and how to work content that appeals to people,”Droze told RT. “The way the article is written is so silly. They’re just talking about that RT created content and it reached a young audience of people who want authenticity and who want real news, and who want news outside the US government's version of events,”the journalist added. In particular, the NYT article criticized the compliments RT attracted from Robert Kyncl, who was YouTube’s vice president at the time when RT smashed through the billion views milestone. In particular, Kyncl emphasized that RT offers“authentic”news content instead of“agendas or propaganda,”which helps the outlet to bond with its viewers. “I think what users generally appreciate is authenticity. It is very apparent from everything that is going on on Youtube. So instead of having aspirational programming or agendas and propaganda, people really respond to authenticity,”Kyncl told RT's Kevin Owen in 2013. The media experts agree with Kyncl's assessment offered years ago. RT is popular“because it services people, because people find it interesting, not because of some kind of brainwashing or collusion,”legal and media analyst Lionel said. In fact, YouTube hascontinuedto commend RT’s content selection, production and audience retention throughout the years. RTrocketedto 5 billion views on YouTube in September, maintaining its undisputed leadership position among international news networks, and outstripping by far the total number of views for BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera and Euronews. ‘Mouthpiece of neocon war machine’: Freeman’s ‘War with Russia’ video creates stir on Twitterhttps://t.co/9YMzl6KYwepic.twitter.com/5g6qyW0Rqb And while experts and YouTube itself agree that RT is succeeding in building strong connections with its vast audience, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)echoedthe NYT assessment, accusing not only Google, but also Facebook and Twitter of allowing the Russian news outlet to post“unreliable, misleading and highly partisan content.”And as is becoming customary, both outlets provided no concrete examples to back its claims. Log out of Facebook. Delete your Twitter. Sleep with one eye open – Russians are everywhere (Op-Ed by Danielle Ryan)https://t.co/cDXBiqQs4B This kind of reporting by the WSJ and the NYT is tantamount to a “witch hunt,” Bergamini believes. “It’s a witch hunt for anybody that has any relationship with anything to do with Russia or anything Russian it seems,”Bergamini said.“[To say] that RT – because they were successful on YouTube – is somehow embedded with YouTube and therefore Google is just madness. [They] are choking out accusations without any real evidence whatsoever.” In a recent drive to somehow tarnish the public view of RT, a lobby group funded by George Soros, along with the EU and US governments, targeted 2,327 people who appeared as experts and guests on RT. The report by the European Values think tank states that appearing on RT is counterproductive and makes the guest a“useful idiot”to a“hostile foreign power.”Expressing one’s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to“complicity with the Russian propaganda machine.” But people are not“idiots,”and consciously chose to watch and appear on RT because the channel's content stands out from the mainstream media, argued Ray Finch, an MEP from the UK Independence Party (UKIP). “The fact of the matter is: ordinary people know where to get their news. They can choose anywhere they like... It seems that RT is giving some form of news that people like, and so people are consuming it. If they didn't like it, they are not forced to watch it, they can go and watch CNN or Al Jazeera or read the NYT online,”Finch told RT. “CNN is known worldwide now as the Clinton News Network, the BBC is the voice of the remainers as far as Brexit is concerned, Russia Today is what it says on the tin, it is backed by Russia. People take that into account. The NYT and people like that are assuming people are idiots,”Finch said. Boris says Labour MPs speaking to RT is a ‘scandal’ ... despite his dad appearing only last month Just last week, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed that it was a“scandal”for Labour MPs to appear on RT. However, every time RT makes western media headlines, the reaction to the popularity of the channel only seems to grow, Lionel noted. “If I didn’t know better, I would swear RT is working on one of the most incredible stealth PR programs ever. Every time the New York Times or the Washington Post or anybody else does some exposé about RT, it makes people in this country even more interested and more fascinated with what RT does,”Lionel pointed out. Since RT registered on YouTube in 2007, the network has been constantly expanding its online presence, bringing to its viewers the latest and most viral news in a wide range of video formats, while exploring new designs. Last year, RT broke new ground in posting the first 360-degree HD video from aboard the International Space Station. RT’s most popular videos over the last year include Donald Trump’s victory speech after winning the presidential election, an interview with the President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, and a documentary about a hitman who worked for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. “RT’s goal is, and has always been, to inform. The hysteria surrounding such mundane activities as RT’s social-media advertising of its content — something done by practically all news organizations — speaks to the establishment’s fear of losing the monopoly on information, and betrays a concerted effort to push RT out of the US market,”RT said in astatementto the WSJ. Smoking gun or nothingburger? WaPo claims Russia ‘meddled’ in election through Google, YouTube Droze believes there is a more sinister agenda behind the ongoing anti-RT campaign, and that is, to silence all alternative news flows. “It is bigger than just going after Russia,”Droze said.“It is about alternative opinions and independent news that contradict the American audience. They want to limit that view on YouTube. They want to limit that view on Facebook.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"22 Oct, 2017",‘Report listing RT’s guests is designed to intimidate',"A new report by a US-funded Czech think tank that targeted RT’s on-air guests is an attempt to stifle any views that go outside the accepted US neocon foreign policy of interventionism, Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute, told RT. The group, called“European Values Think-Tank,”released a supposedly damning report about RT, criticizing over 2,300 experts who shared their views on the channel.The institute, which receives funding from the US and other Western governments, called RT’s guests“useful idiots,”to borrow from a famous quote from Communist leader Vladimir Lenin. Ironically, the list included the names of many figures known as harsh critics of Russia, including Republican Senator John McCain; film director Rob Reiner, a member of the Committee to Investigate Russia; and even former First Lady Michelle Obama. RT:What do you make of this report? Are our guests “useful idiots,” in your opinion? Daniel McAdams:I was looking through the list of guests who are""Russian dupes""and I see Dick Cheney, I see Joe Lieberman, I see Lindsey Graham, I see Michael Morell… So, the Russians agents are at very top of the US government. Even the leading anti-Russia figures are in fact Russian agents. I think we must hide under our beds because it is terrifying. But I would say more seriously, what this is – [it’s] an attempt to stifle any views that go outside the accepted US neocon foreign policy of intervention. It is ironic that it is a Czech think tank doing this. This well may have come out from the old StB – the old Czechoslovakian intelligence service, which did its best to keep Czechs from hearing any kind of foreign policy information that deviated from their own government’s communist line. This sounds a lot like that. RT:Do you think some guests might be deterred from appearing on RT? DM: I think that is the intent. Let’s look at this: the reason I made a point of it earlier on the guests they had – this is not designed to inform individuals; this is not designed to inform – it is designed to propagandize, it is designed to intimidate; it is designed to isolate. I am certainly not here to defend RT. I am not here to defend Russia. What I am here to defend, though, is the marketplace of ideas. RT provides a platform for individuals who do not buy into the neocon US foreign policy line to have a voice. I have never been asked at RT what I am going to say beforehand. Any time I’ve gone on the mainstream media, or attempted to, I have a long, sometimes 20- or 30-minute, interview beforehand, and often I am told my comments are not needed. So, what we need in a free society is a marketplace of ideas that you maybe disagree with, but you should have the right to hear. How ironic that the United States government is funding an organization that is restricting the Americans’ ability to hear different views outside the US government view. RT:You're a regular guest on RT. How do you feel about being described in the report as a ""useful idiot""? Annie Machon:I think we should wear it as a badge of honor, because it shows that there is a group of people out there, who are not afraid to challenge the Western consensus – perhaps we should have a club, who knows. I would say, though, more seriously, that I have been appearing on mainstream media news outlets for the last 20 years around the planet, and my perspective, my stance has remained absolutely resolute and absolutely the same. I have the same respective, same opinions on all sorts of different outlets. And it is only when I appear on RT that apparently I am now deemed to be a“useful idiot.” I would also say, as well, that RT is one of the very few TV channels that, when it invites me on to do an interview, they do not insist on a pre-interview to censor and vet what I might be about to say. Many other TV channels do, because they are scared and they want to make sure that they are in control of what their guests are saying. Yet, I still appear on many other TV channels. Perhaps what I am saying is not being Putin’s“useful idiot,”perhaps it is just an alternative perspective that people need to hear. RT:The report says our guests ""undermine Western democracy"" and ""pollute the information space."" Is that what you're up to when you're on the air with us? AM:Absolutely not. I am trying to put forward my perspective, my opinions, based on 25 years of expertise within certain fields, and I feel I do that professionally. Obviously other news outlets feel I do it professionally too, because I get re-invited back to all of those, too. So, it is just a case of freedom of expression. ‘Propaganda campaign by European Values’:Paul Vallely, retired US army general RT:Your name is among those on the list. How do you feel about being described in the report as a “useful idiot”? Paul Vallely:It seems like a propaganda campaign by “European Values,” whatever European values means today. I was with Fox News for eight years. I probably have done many thousands of shows and interviews on national security, military and so on, but I’ve never been called a “useful idiot.” I am sure they wouldn’t bring me back on if I was an idiot. It’s ridiculous. The worst of Times: Establishment paper keeps up attack on RT over London tube ads.https://t.co/6YyUcU8uHV RT:Why is there so much Western governmental pressure on RT right now? Paul Vallely:I think it goes back to this whole conundrum that’s been developed in the US as the result of our election – trying to blame Russia for everything, when there is nothing, no factual information that has come out at all. It is being reversed now – whether they’re looking at the Clinton Foundation and their collusion with the Iranian report, Uranium One. But I think all of this from the press standpoint – it is a way for them to attack Russia all the time, always for the most case unfounded – the same thing with US politicians attacking Russia. I have researched all of these cases, and I have seen no collusion; I have seen no developmental things by the Russian government or Putin to attack Europe, their leaders, or President Trump. All this is very unfounded and unnecessary. RT:The think tank that published the report is sponsored by, among others, the US Embassy in the Czech Republic. Does that expose it to the charge of bias? PV:It probably does. Especially if you put George Soros’s name up there, which is very anti-American, very anti-Trump – certainly not loved by anybody in Europe; but anything they fund seems to be targeted on bringing down governments and attacking even legitimate governments.

"21 Oct, 2017",‘Useful idiots?’ George Soros’ Prague lobbyists direct their fire at RT guests,"A lobby group, funded by George Soros and EU and US governments, has smeared 2,327 prominent guests of RT as ""useful idiots."" This amounts to a McCarthyite assault on free speech in the media space. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv What do Harrison Ford, Evander Holyfield, Mr T, Will.I.Am, Oliver Stone, Stephen Fry and Vivienne Westwood all have in common? Aside from being really famous, they are also united by the fact they’ve appeared on RT. And Monika Richter, an obsessive at a Czech-based pressure group called“European Values Think-Tank,”purports to have compiled a list of all the leading western celebrities, journalists, commentators, academics and politicians who have featured on this network’s programmes in recent years. Something which you might think would come in handy, going forward, for new RT producers looking for potential guests, as it contains 2,327 names. Except, alas, it’s not really very accurate. The haphazard, careless and shoddy compilation makes some bizarre mistakes, such as confusing British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for an actor impersonating him. And, even more bizarrely, mistaking the legendary Larry King for the equally illustrious Larry David. Not once, but dozens of times.Badly implemented smear campaigns from various anti-Russia lobbyists are nothing new. But this attempt is especially inept. Because it’s so pockmarked with mistakes that it looks like it was knocked out in a weekend. Which makes its opening suggestion on how “politicians and media organisations should publiclly (sic) commit to a higher degree of fact-checking rigour” all the more remarkable in its speciousness. Before going further, let’s be clear about who pays for the activities of“European Values”and whoseintereststhis faux-academic concern serves. In 2015, its biggest single source of private funding was the veteran billionairevulture-capitalistGeorge Soros (around 25% in total via two Open Society Foundation agencies). In Russia, the organization is considered so toxic that it has been banned as a“security threat.”Furthermore, this viewpoint is not restricted to Moscow, as the government of his homeland, Hungary, has singled Soros out as an“enemy of the state.”Indeed, even Israel concurs with this view, with its Foreign Ministry saying he“continuously undermines Israel’s democratically elected governments.” So, we know Soros is no friend of democracy. Instead, he uses his vast fortune to interfere in sovereign states and undermine administrations he dislikes. Which is ironically what Richter accuses RT of doing when she writes how“RT’s raison d’être is to denigrate the West at all costs and undermine public confidence in the viability of liberal democracy.”Something which is completely untrue, given that the actual rationale behind RT is to present Russia’s point of view. Also, as it happens, Moscow has excellent relations with many other democracies including South Korea, India and Israel. And is also on friendly terms with numerous individual European Union states even if, under pro-American leaders in Berlin and Paris, the collective has effectively outsourced its foreign policy to the United States in recent years, rendering it automatically anti-Russian. Incidentally, aside from Soros, the other big donors to the “European Values” lobby group are the European Commission and Parliament and the embassies of the United States and the United Kingdom. Thus, it doesn’t take a genius to follow the money and see the agendas at play. And it’s instructive that Richter is alsoconnectedto the Atlantic Council, a large US political action body,bankrolledby the Ukrainian World Congress, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Raytheon Company andthe US State Department. All entities that, of course, benefit from strained relations between Russia and the west. Most of Richter’s key claims make little sense. She keeps accusing RT of“disinformation”but provides no evidence of it being deliberate, merely highlighting a few factual mistakes over the years which are no more extraordinary than those of rival outlets. Because there is no news organization that never gets it wrong. The author also cites“the US intelligence report on Russian electoral interference,""a laughably misinformed document that has been dismissed by every credible western Russian expert. And she continuously refers to guests as“useful idiots;""an incredible insult to fling at giants such as Kofi Annan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Peter Sutherland, Jeremy Corbyn and Wolfgang Ischinger, who have achieved far more in life than the author ever will, on this evidence. European Values’ other“big reveal is”that“RT uses guest appearances by Western politicians, journalists and writers, academics, and other influential public personalities to boost its credibility.”Which is actually not strictly true. In reality RT, like all other TV stations, mainly does it to boost ratings, because, quite obviously, viewers would rather watch, say, Noam Chomsky (listed as‘Noah’here in yet another error) opine on world affairs than some nobody who thinks the US government is beyond criticism. Additionally, Richter accuses RT of anti-Westernism (particularly anti-Americanism). Which makes one wonder how she’d describe American media coverage of Russia, if she were being truly honest. The lobbyist then makes an astounding statement:“RT never reports about Russia – only about the failings and hypocrisies of Western society.”Which is a complete lie, and if you doubt that, clickmy pictureon the top left of this page and you will see that the vast majority of my own writing on here is Russia-centric. Richter contradicts herself all over the shop. For instance, she claims RT’s impact on western audiences is“minimal to modest,”yet, a few lines later she warns how RT's“specific effects”on its viewers“should be a research priority for all organizations and governments interested in countering the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign.”And later she thunders that Russia’s“disinformation campaign,”which allegedly includes RT’s journalism, presents a“security hazard”that“should not be taken lightly”– but then says it's“imperative”not to“overinflate”the threat of RT. Of course, the real agenda behind reports of this nature is often exposed by what they omit. And on Saturday, the Prague-based journalist Michael Colborne (who himself has written for Soros-backed blogs) pointed out that the 52-page slander fest was“full of qualifiers and also some arbitrariness with only persons deemed of sufficient public significance and repute are(sic)included."" “This might explain why there’s a few names missing, including two friends of European Values, who themselves have been on RT!”he added. Colborne wasreferringto Julia Davis and Eric Garland, who are today known as particularly determined anti-Russiaactivists, prominent on social media, with perspectives which conveniently mirror the lobby groups agenda.“This is just intellectually dishonest horseshit. Framing every single person ever on RT as an idiot… except your friends, conveniently,”Colborne continued. Well, just fancy that!

"20 Oct, 2017","NGO publishes names of 2,300+ RT guests, labels them ‘useful idiots who undermine Western democracy’","An NGO called the European Values Think-Tank has published a report on RT featuring an extensive list of US and European public figures who have been accused of “undermining western democracy” just by appearing in RT shows. The report, claiming to be an“overview of RT’s editorial strategy and evidence of impact,”comeswith an Excel list of 2,327 people who have appeared on RT over the last four years. The names are carefully arranged in seven categories, including US politicians, UK politicians, European politicians and so on, and are arranged in alphabetical order. The list mentions the shows the guests appeared on, the total number of their appearances, and gives hyperlinks to all the relevant episodes. The report states that appearing on the network is counterproductive and makes the guest a“useful idiot”to a“hostile foreign power.”Expressing one’s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to“complicity with the Russian propaganda machine.” Although the list looks like a really thorough effort at cataloguing all of the RT guests, it’s got a number of strikingly weird blunders. For example, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is there, but only the link attached leads to a satirical show featuring someone impersonating him. Meanwhile, US Senator John McCain’s daughter is mistaken for the senator himself and“Politicking with Larry King”is unexpectedly referred to as“Politicking with Larry David.” Thereportgenerally claims that RT is“an instrument of hostile foreign influence,”which has the sole purpose of“undermining public confidence in the viability of liberal democracy.” It repeatedly discourages any public figures from potentially appearing on any of RT’s shows in the future, as those on the list are accused of boosting RT’s“credibility as a legitimate news network.” The report asserts the opposite in no uncertain terms. It constantly describes RT as the “Kremlin’s mouthpiece” tasked with no less than destroying the western civilization and society from within. It does not mince words calling RT“a second-rate news network with an abysmal reputation and dubious audience numbers”as well as“the Russian propaganda machine”and a“disinformation tool.” However, it eventually gets so much enmeshed in its own allegations that it starts to contradict itself. The paper claims that RT’s influence on its western audiences ranges from“minimal to modest,”yet almost immediately says that the news network’s“specific effects”on its viewers“should be a research priority for all organizations and governments interested in countering the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign.” It further says that Russia’s“disinformation campaign,”which includes RT’s activities, poses a“security hazard”that“should not be taken lightly,”and adds at the same time that it is“imperative”not to“overinflate”the threat of RT. The report was prepared by Monika Richter, who is described as an analyst at the European Values Think-Tank who works specifically for the“Kremlin Watch Program”– a project aimed at“exposing and confronting instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against Western democracies.”Richter alsocooperateswith the Atlantic Council – a US-based think tank, which is known for its staunch anti-Russian stance. The European Values Think-Tank was founded as an NGO in 2005 and is located in the Czech Republic. It claims to be a neutral, not-for-profit organization aimed at defending democracy and not linked to any political force. However, its annual reportrevealsthat one-quarter of its funding comes from various governmental actors, including the US and the UK embassies, the Czech government and several EU structures, such as the European Parliament and the European Commission as well as their subordinate bodies. According to the same report, the NGO receives most of its funding from a large number of private donors. Its biggest single donor are two George Soros’ Open Society Foundation agencies, which cover almost 25 percent of its funding. George Barda, an environmental activist and social justice campaigner, called the report“disappointing”and“a piece of propaganda.” “The reality is that dissident voices in the UK only rarely get into the mainstream media … and RT has been the only news network providing a regular platform for them. Much of this report is incredibly disappointing and it is clearly not even pretending to give any kind of serious consideration to the other side of the argument. It is a fairly standard piece of propaganda,”he said. “Do the author of this report and the politicians in the UK and the US really think that [such people] as Robert Kennedy Jr., Yanis Varoufakis, the former Foreign Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, or the former mayor of London are just ‘idiots’?”Afshin Rattansi, the host of RT’s“Going Underground”show said.“Of course, they are not and this is incredibly insulting,”he said, calling the report a“McCarthy atavism.” He went on to say that the supporters of the anti-Russian campaign first criticize Moscow for allegedly censoring journalists and then suggest doing exactly the same in the West, thus revealing the inconsistency in their own views. Rattansi also drew attention to the fact that RT’s activities have always been in line with the regulations of the UK media watchdog, Ofcom, as the news network has never been fined for any violations. So, it is only the politicians, who“clearly do not want some voices being expressed”publicly, who see some issues with RT, he added. Luzi Stamm, an MP from the Swiss People’s Party, said that a smear campaign that the western elites wage against Russia and RT is just a part of a bigger crackdown against the“dissenting voices”inside Europe and the US. “This recent development in Europe is relatively dangerous,”he told RT, adding that the campaign against political dissent in Europe is becoming increasingly more“aggressive”and“one of the games they [the western elites] are playing is destroying the reputation of the politicians they do not like.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"18 Oct, 2017",Tycoon George Soros transfers $18bn to his Open Society Foundations,"Billionaire investor George Soros has given away nearly $18 billion to his Open Society Foundations, transforming it into the “second largest” charity in the US after the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation. On Tuesday, the 87-year-old tycoon moved the hefty sum from his personal funds into his non-profit group, the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times report. Soros, the 29th richestmanin the world with a net worth of more than $25 billion according to Forbes, had reportedly been working on the transfer for several years. The magnate intends to“leave the vast majority of his wealth to the Open Society Foundations,”the chief of the group’s strategic communications and public affairs, Laura Silber,said, as quoted by AFP. The investment heavyweight set up the Open Society Foundations in 1984. It has since become the target of criticism among the billionaire’s other projects. The charity has been accused of inciting so-called color revolutions to install governments friendly to the US – from the Serbian 'Bulldozer Revolution' in 2000 to the Ukrainian uprising in 2013. Soros’ foundations are said to be the most influential around the globe, as“there is no part of the world that they have not been,”according to Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, ascitedby the New York Times. READ MORE: State Dept sued over funding Soros operations in Macedonia The tycoon’s activities have been repeatedly slammed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and other officials, who accuse him of weakening nation states, saying Soros-funded groupshelpedillegal migrants to enter Europe at the peak of the refugee crisis. In 2015, Soros called on EU states to share the burden“to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually for the foreseeable future.”In July, Orbanslammedthe billionaire for using the EU to create a“new, mixed, Muslimized Europe”and called on European institutions to limit his influence. Months later, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assangeclaimedthat Soros, alongside the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), funded the mainstream media’s narrative of the Panama Papers scandal to trigger a negative propaganda campaign against Russia. The whistleblower claimed that the scandal pushed a negative angle against Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead of focusing on the many Western figures exposed in the documents.

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence-free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of “color revolutions” around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago. October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago. It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first“color revolution,”a technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones. According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed. There is just one problem. None of it is true. The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was“transitioned”from Communism and despoiled in the process. Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed. After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi-NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means. US Ambassador Richard Miles “midwifed” the creation of the 'Democratic Opposition of Serbia' (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats. The party’s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits. Instead, the coalition’s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild-mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election. Meanwhile, a student movement called 'Otpor' (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US-trained activists, like Srda Popovic. Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience. ""Suitcases of cash” smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t-shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo. Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self-appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission. After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5. Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election. After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum. As a result, Đindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of “reformist” expediency. Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre- or post-electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority. Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re-branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over – and went on to deliver most of Washington’s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things. None of this really mattered to the revolution’s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned. They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere. Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 'Rose Revolution' in Georgia, installing in power the US-educated Mikhail Saakashvili. This, too, proved detrimental to the country’s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption. He later joined the US-backed government in Ukraine, but that’s another story. In 2004, the US sponsored the 'Orange Revolution' in Kiev, backing a DOS-like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko. By that point, Washington wasn’t even pretending to be uninvolved. ""US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev,""ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus. “The operation - engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience - is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people's elections,""wrote the Guardian’s Ian Traynor, noting that“the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000.” A decade later, 'color revolution' techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass. The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp. But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world. In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam’s next target. A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year’s 'Arab Spring' uprisings. Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country’s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people’s demise. While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term. That’s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience. Besides, they won’t stick around to see the consequences - there is always the next revolution to plan and execute. And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom. They sing the seductive song of“bringing down a dictator”(there’s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems. Before the dust from the 'revolution' clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos. If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters. While the 'color revolutions' are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country’s politics. Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse. Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country’s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago.

"5 Jun, 2017","If George Soros is the answer to the EU crisis, what on earth is the question?","Just as a stopped clock is right twice a day, George Soros, a man who’s done more to destabilize countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis. Mr. Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1. It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet. He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars. Where Mr. Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: “After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent.” Soros-funded groups are only network following ‘mafia ways’ in Hungary – Orbanhttps://t.co/NPoXZlq4e3pic.twitter.com/CsQoLf1Sle The truth of the matter is that the Soviet Union liberated Europe from fascism, that without the inordinate tenacity and sacrifice of the Soviet Russian people and the Red Army, Hitler would have succeeded in colonizing the continent. As US historian Peter Kuznick writes, “Up to [D-Day, June 1944], the Soviet Union had almost singlehandedly battled the German military. Until the invasion of Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten. Germany lost over 6 million men on the Eastern Front and approximately one million on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean.” Returning to Mr. Soros’ speech we are regaled with the assertion that “the EU is surrounded by hostile powers – Putin’s Russia, Erdogan’s Turkey, Sisi’s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can’t.” Here again, the billionaire investor is guilty of peddling a convenient inversion of the truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU’s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr. Soros, also happens to be a member. It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU. In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros’ bald assertion of Russia as the ‘bad guy’ into disrepute. READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2.0: 'Russia's surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems’ This being said, Mr. Soros is right to point out that if “the European Union carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement. That is why the European Union needs to be radically reinvented.” The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades. It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self-evident detriment of millions of working people. It is this economic instability that has been the key ‘push factor’ behind mass immigration over the same period. George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process. European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with. However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens. It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short-term investment as and where the opportunity arises. It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of ‘freedom’ and ‘liberty’ that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08. The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti-politics – or to be more specific ‘anti-politics-as-usual’ – that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year. European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron. It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe’s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome – i.e. Washington – with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them. George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU. On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem. Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward.

"27 Apr, 2017","Scores injured as protesters storm Macedonian Parliament (PHOTOS, VIDEO)","Scores of people were reportedly injured as demonstrators fought their way through a police cordon and stormed the Macedonian Parliament amid ethnic tensions in the small country. Over 100 people were injured during violence in Skopje on Thursday evening, including 22 police officers and at least three MPs, local media say. The scuffles came as nationalist Macedonian protesters were angered by the election of an ethnic Albanian as parliamentary speaker. The controversial move escalated the ethnic tensions amongst the 2.1 million residents of the small country, which has been locked in a political crisis since 2015.  Some 200 people forced their way into the parliament building after the vote took place. Live footage from the scene shows camera stands and other equipment being hurled at a group of defending lawmakers. Zoran Zaev, leader of the Social Democrats party (SDSM), apparently received a head injury and is seen with his face and shirt covered in blood. Witnesses said they also saw blood in some of the hallways of the parliament after police cleared the protesters from the building and used stun grenades to disperse the crowds outside. “In an attempt to take the situations inside and outside the parliament under control, we have ordered police to use all measures,”the interim government’s interior minister, Agim Nuhiu, said in a televised interview justifying the police action. Thursday’s violence is just the latest episode in a political crisis that was triggered by the fall of the country’s government after a wiretapping scandal in 2015. Macedonia held new parliamentary elections in December of 2016, in which the previously ruling conservative VMRO-DPMNE won 51 seats to the SDSM’s 49. However, the socialists proposed a minority coalition with parties representing the Albanian ethnic minority, which comprise roughly a third of Macedonia’s population. As a condition of participation, the Albanian parties have been insisting on a seven-point platform that includes making Albanian an official language in Macedonia. The plan is said to have been co-authored with the government of Albania, which has triggered protests from Macedonian nationalists. Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov has refused to give Zaev a mandate to form a new government.  The protesters were voicing their disapproval of the coalition electing Talat Xhaferi, a former defence minister from the ethnic Albanian DUI party, as president of the parliament.

The situation was defused when the EU promised the country eventual membership. BREAKING: Barricades broken through journalists attacked by masked men!#Skopje#Macedonia#Couppic.twitter.com/OEchBBcTlV EU officials have condemned the violence at Macedonia’s parliament and called on its political parties to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis. European Council President Donald Tusk visited the country earlier in April to meet with President Ivanov. “I came here with the strong message from the EU leaders that commitment to European perspectives is unequivocal,”Tusk said at the time.“I therefore hope that you will continue to follow this compass and avoid anything that could further fuel tensions also along ethnic lines,”he added. Russia has called on foreign politicians to stop putting pressure on Skopje and allow the Macedonians solve their own problems on their own terms. Moscow said the eagerness on the part of EU officials to hail the election of Xhaferi, despite his questionable legitimacy, has contributed to the country’s tensions. Macedonia’s progress towards EU membership has been blocked by Athens over a naming dispute. There is a province called Macedonia in Greece, which considers the use of its name by the former Yugoslavian republic illegitimate.

The hack has been attributed to ‘Fancy Bear,’ a hacking group said to have connections to Russia. Denmark’s security service, Politiets Efterretningstjeneste’s (PET) Centre for Cyber Security said in itsreportthat a“foreign player”had accessed non-classified documents, and found the hacking group APT [Advanced Persistent Threat] 28, aka Fancy Bear, was behind the hacks which took place between March 2015 and October 2016.

It was also linked to hacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency. Fancy Bear was given its title by private security company CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee after it was hacked during the 2016 election. The company said Russian Intelligence Services-linked hacking groups, named APT28 and APT29, aka Cozy Bear, were behind the hack.

"27 Mar, 2017","Are Russian lives 'tough and thankless,' as the Guardian says?","The house journal of Britain's liberal elite believes Russian lives are ""tough and thankless."" It's another example of the dreadful quality of English-language coverage of this country. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Correspondents for Western media outlets in Moscow are known as the“hack pack.”And the term could be considered pejorative if they hadn't christened themselves with it. Very few are qualified or properly trained journalists, and most of them wouldn’t survive five minutes in a proper British or American newsroom. Not only because they’d no longer be able to blame every negative, calamity, hardship, tribulation or rain shower on‘the Kremlin.’ That said, the quandary is far from universal, and there are some very talented foreign journalists in Moscow. But, frequently, their best efforts are spoiled by overzealous editors back home, who rigidly stick to the editorial line on""Putin's Russia."" Surely, this is the only explanation for how the Guardian - a rabidly anti-Russian British newspaper - ended up captioning a report from Irkutsk last week with mind-bogglingly offensive text? Because the'rag'told us Russian lives are“tough and thankless.”The hypothesis appears to have been based on a short video clip, featuring one of the better writers on this beat. Let’s be clear here, in post-Soviet Russia, some cities and regions have flourished, and others have languished. For instance, you couldn’t venture to Tyumen, Krasnodar or Vladivostok and not be impressed by the scale of the improvements. However, a lot of places are standing still, or getting worse. And this is particularly problematic in eastern Siberia and the Far East, where remote geography leads to high prices and a lack of inward investment. Furthermore, the harsh climatic conditions lend themselves to exaggerated gloom. Thus, presenting a perfect backdrop to portray hardship. Nevertheless, to suggest folk are enduring“tough and thankless”lives is extraordinarily obnoxious. And you can only imagine the Guardian’s outrage if a Russian newspaper ventured to bleak British northern outposts like Blackpool, Sunderland or Oldham and used the same language to describe their inhabitants? It'd be akin to the Olympics for offended, scandalized and infuriated liberal commentators. Yet, as it happens, London has far less of an excuse for its failure to tackle post-industrial decline than Moscow. The United Kingdom didn’t suffer what Russia endured in the 1980’s and 1990’s when the entire economic and governmental system collapsed. Also, by comparison to the world's largest nation, England is a tiny country where residents of hollowed-out towns can commute to alternative employment centers. Correlatively, in the case of Irkutsk the nearest big city, Krasnoyarsk is 1,062 km away by road. Which is greater than the straight-line distance from Land's End to John o' Groats.  This Guardian report was part of a series it is currently running called“The Putin Paradox”, which allegedly seeks to discover“how someone so reviled in the West has been so successful at home.”To find the answer, they’ve engaged a lady who wrote a book aboutpost-SovietUkraine, another from a George Soroscut-out, and Ukraine’sForeign Minister. Which is a bit like asking Manchester City supporters to evaluate the career of United legend Alex Ferguson. Yet, they do allow one voice semi-sympathetic to Putin’s achievements, that ofAnne Garrels, a former National Public Radio correspondent, who has spent considerable time in Chelyabinsk. As it happens, the Guardian has so far failed to critique the""liberal opposition""the paper has championed for years. A strange bunch of activists who seem more focused on receiving positive mentions in the English-language press than winning the support of actual Russian voters. And who's central policy platform appears to be telling Russians that everything about their country is awful? Thus, seeing as the Guardian can’t be bothered to offer much balance in its project, let’s answer the question here. By briefly offering a few reasons why Vladimir Putin is broadly supported by Russians. READ MORE: Can Britain and Russia be friends again? For instance, Russian life expectancy, which had cratered in the late-Soviet period, and during the catastrophic‘liberal and democratic’ nineties, has rebounded impressively in the Putin-era. Men now live almost eight years longer than in 2005, and the overall average is close to 72 years. Meanwhile, over the same period, infant mortality has declined from 10.2 to 5.1, per 1,000 births. Incidentally, this is now lower than theUS rate. Meanwhile, the number of medical facilities that provide high-tech health care has jumped from 90 to 932 and,accordingto state statistics,“over the past two years, in 2015 and 2016, the number of foreign patients coming to Russia for treatment at Russian clinics has surged by 87 percent to exceed 13,500 in 2016.” Furthermore, despite the nasty recession of recent years, Russiawagesare far higher - by all measures - than in 1999, and unemployment remains low. Especially when compared to most of the rest of Europe. Putin has also overseen a restoration of national pride. From the successful Sochi Olympics to winning the right to host World Cup 2018. Also, despite Western anger at the annexation/reabsorption ofCrimea, it has gone down very well domestically, with 88 percent of Russians supporting the move, according to pollster’s Levada. This is often cited as revenge for how the West took advantage of a crippled post-Soviet Russia to push its sphere of influence up to the country’s borders. Does anything good ever happen in Russia? (Op-Edge)https://t.co/GTUXsNfDrqpic.twitter.com/q6Ud5QNoBx  While the recession hurt, there are very few cities which are not, considerably, better off today than back in 2000, when he first took office as President. Additionally, unlike in Yeltsin years, Putin has created the conditions for citizens to buy into the system. Today, people have mortgages and car loans and, much like Westerners, see their property as insurance. Obviously, no homeowner wants a systemic collapse, which would wipe out the value of their asset. Because while color revolutions are great fun for Western journalists and activists - who can build careers from them - they are not as enjoyable for the ordinary folk left to pick up the pieces when the news vans have skipped town. Russians are acutely aware of the damage the Maidan coup/revolution has wrought in Ukraine. When you add that to still fresh memories of the wild 1990’s, Putin’s guarantee of stability is generally considered better than any alternative at this time. Because the Guardian, and other Western media outlets, largely restrict their pages to voices hostile to Russia and generally dismiss bearers of alternative opinions as""shills,""a toxic atmosphere has been created. Where journalists are aware that if they don't convey antipathy to the""Putin regime""in their dispatches, they won't be hired. And that's what has things the way they are.

"15 Feb, 2017",Munich Security Report: Here comes the apocalypse,"In advance of the 2017 Munich Security Conference (MSC) the organizers have published a report with the subheading ‘Post Truth, Post West, Post Order?’ The question answers itself, though not for reasons Western liberals will likely accept. In the interests of accuracy let us be clear: it is not the West, it is Western liberalism that is in crisis. The two entities are distinct and indeed, as events have and continue to prove, completely antithetical to one another. The first paragraph of theMSC reportreads as if the end of the world is upon us. “The world is facing an illiberal moment. Across the West and beyond, illiberal forces are gaining ground. From within, Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal-democratic status quo. From outside, Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order. And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises - with Syria as the prime example.” #Assad: US-Russia cooperation could benefit Syria & wider worldhttps://t.co/G8xOCEeI9B Implied in this statement is the assumption that liberalism, or liberal values, should be considered sacrosanct, the sine qua non of cultural, political, economic and moral virtue, and as such the values according to which every country, society, and people must exist, regardless of cultural, regional, or historical specificities. Therein lies the problem. Despite the carnage, chaos, instability, conflict without end, societal collapse, and economic dislocation that has been wrought in the name of those very‘sacrosanct’liberal values and liberal democracy in recent times, its proponents continue to live in a state of abject denial. Try telling the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Africa, Latin America, who’ve seen their countries and societies destroyed in service to liberal democracy, about this “illiberal moment” they are meant to fear. Try telling the ever and shamefully-increasing number of victims of poverty, lack of education, poor housing, bad or non-existent healthcare provision in Western countries, where liberal values predominate, about them also. And when it comes to Syria, cited in the report as evidence of a“security crisis”which“Western states seem unwilling and unable to effectively tackle,”have these people no shame? The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars – their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al-Qaeda against the US in 2001. In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al-Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification. Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi-jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself. The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term ‘Western civilization’. Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: “Donald Trump’s comments about NATO being “obsolete” have caused great uncertainty among America’s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. The European Union is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia.” Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality. NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim. It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change – i.e. in the former Yugoslavia and Libya. It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm – embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal-democratic values and norms have wrought. In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests. As George Orwell wrote,“War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe. How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest. But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem. What they describe as a“revisionist Russia”is really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony. Replace“revisionist”with“strong,”and you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017. They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society. Russia’s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council. The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest.

"13 Feb, 2017",Merkel breaking German law & endangering the country – OSCE Assembly ex-VP,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has been dominating the German – and European – political landscape for over a decade. But after years of economic and refugee crises, unpopular decisions, and a growing divide between EU members, Merkel is facing opposition inside her country and across the Atlantic as well. With anti-establishment forces strong across Europe and a new leader in America, how will the German political landscape shape up this year? And with the new president in Germany standing against confrontation with Russia – should we be ready for a policy shift? We ask the former vice president of the OSCE Assembly, and former state secretary to Germany’s defense minister – Willy Wimmer. Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Willy Wimmer, former vice-head of OSCE Assembly, and former State Secretary to Germany's Defence Minister, welcome to the show, it's really great to have you with us. Now, The Federal election to determine the new Chancellor is coming up in September and Angela Merkel’s top contender Martin Schulz has promised to turn the vote into ‘a real thrill’, positioning himself as a ‘man of the people’. With Merkel already under attack for her immigration policies, is Schulz going to destroy her chances for a fourth term? Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany. They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September. That's an inner German situation. There's another situation coming from our West European neighbors. We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade. It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September. SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people’s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary - is he taking a page out of Trump’s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies. The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer. Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10-15 years, the Social-Democratic Party no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich. Therefore, it's normal to re-adjust the direction of the Social Democratic Party. SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote  - even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia. Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool. I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it's so interesting that even the German Security Service - Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) - just told the public that there's no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation. So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation. Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse. SS:Germany’s vice-chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U.S. should find common ground - but not at the expense of Europe - what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U.S.-Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There's an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades. They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U.S.-Russian condominium on Europe. When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him. This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War. SS:Germany’s foreign minister was the first to meet with America’s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson - after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban. Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses’ passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation. Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U.S. President. SS:Yeah. WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well. But, this time, it is unbelievable. In the campaign in the U.S., we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps. For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U.S. government and this is not good for our relations with the U.S. and not good for our relations with other European countries. You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain. Yes, they celebrate a special relationship - and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities. That is not in our German interest. SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump’s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany’s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency. Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave - or go head-on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U.S., and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60-70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U.S., but nevertheless we did it - and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic... yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation. We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners. We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can't blame Germans for doing better business than themselves. It's up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such - and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin. That's the reality. SS:Berlin is saying it’s going to boost military spending - after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance - does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation. NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete. NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance. NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such. What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian-Western border. This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations. NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such - I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population. SS:Should Trump’s criticism of NATO be a wake-up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours. Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders. To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South. When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it's not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it's under control of the U.S. or whether it's under the control of the European Union. I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military. When we face today's situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U.S.-led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us. That is the situation since '99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe. Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it... I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago - I think it depends on the U.S. how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s. Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale. We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours. SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti-Russian sanctions in place. At the same time, Trump hinted the U.S. could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin. If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU - people and the population at all, the don't have any kind of understanding of the sanctions. The sanctions are in place because of the coup-d'etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West. Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There's no reason. We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public. I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment. SS:There’s opposition to Russia tie-mending both in Brussels and in Washington. You’ve mentioned in a recent interview the “war establishment” of Washington that is trying to block Trump’s attempts to reconcile with Russia - and be in generally less hawkish than usual. Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It's what we see in this very moment in the U.S.. In my opinion, here's one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations - which are possible, and which are in our interests - with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin. That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party - senator McCain and senator Graham - to organise the outbreak of the WWIII. I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what's going on in the U.S.: it's a battle about war and peace. Trump is peace and McCain is war - and these are the words of the U.S. President. SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump’s travel ban on majority-Muslim states, Bavaria’s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump’s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy - are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel. President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole. We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries. We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people. I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years. Therefore, we have to re-organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation. That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe. SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first-hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack. However, calls from the country’s interior minister to centralise Germany’s security structure have been met with criticism - why? Right now each of Germany’s 16 states has its own intelligence service - is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole. But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development - she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015. She didn't put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station. Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles - not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country. We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who's not acting on the basis of our own law. The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" - and this expresses all. SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country’s inability to swiftly return migrants who don’t qualify for asylum - the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn’t want him. Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There's the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn't explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn't want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament. We live in a situation where we never lived in before - the German government has to be based on our own laws. When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don't know that they are in the country, of whom we don't know about their names, their background - I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid - we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws. Therefore we have all these security problems. SS:Alright. Mr. Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany's Defense minister, former vice-President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent's security issues and Germany's efforts to tackle them.

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt – Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough. The nation’s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign-backed NGOs operating in the country. The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line – on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues. Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó. Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Péter Szijjártó, Hungary’s Foreign MInister, it's great to have you here on our program, welcome. Peter Szijjártó:My pleasure, thank you. SS:So, we'll start with the latest:  Budapest has vowed to ‘sweep out’ foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros.  I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that. How dangerous are those organisations for your country? PS:Actually, there's a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country - which is a very dangerous approach, because it's not true. There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would've run, so there were no people voting for ""I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me"". People vote on politicians, on political parties. So it's the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous - number one. Number two, you know, there's a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it's not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent. So, that's why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments - then it should be known to the people. SS:Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down.Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with 'local groups' despite government's opposition. PS:What we say is that they have to be transparent. People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics - then these people have to know, whom these are representing. That's what we want to know. SS:Well, who are they? PS:We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary. He has a very clear, let's say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn't like our approach, doesn't like our policies. But, it's not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it's the Hungarian people. We find it very anti-democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for. SS:But when George Soros says that more than ever he's going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he's going to go against the government's will. How's that going to play out? PS:He has a very clear intention, that's definitely true, but I think it's an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence. This is what we have heard a lot from the U.S., for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country... So, it's a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors - people, persons, businessmen - of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves. SS:If you're saying you're going after NGOs, you can't just go after Soros-funded NGOs, you'll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well. Are you ready to do that? PS:My position is that we have to ensure level-playing field. So, double standards - we don't like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by. Actually, it's... I wouldn't say 'funny' because it's too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non-Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter ""N"" is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations. As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U.S. foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family - so, actually, I don't think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non-governmental organisation is too much. SS:So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country's foreign policy? PS:I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life - social, political life - of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are. SS:But here's a tricky part, though, because Hungary’s ruling party has also benefited from Soros-funded NGOs, before they came to power - so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? PS:Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad - in the U.S. and in the UK. But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back - is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things. SS:Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe - do you think with him in the office it's going to be easier for Hungary to ""get rid"" of these Soros-foundation NGOs in your country? PS:What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U.S. and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points. There were very clear attempts from the U.S. to interfere in our internal issues. Just to give you an example, I was given a two-page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U.S. as a foreign minister. This two-pager contained some measures which the U.S. government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship - but, come on! I mean, it's too much, it's interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary. Although our economic and defence-military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad. So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve. SS:We're going to talk about U.S.-Hungary relationship in just a bit. Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary - how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? PS:What I understand from my colleagues, since I don't supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations. SS:What's the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? PS:Since I'm not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard. SS:I spoke to Ex-president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus  and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe... Why are they still so supportive of this open-door policy? What do you think? PS:I wouldn't speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries - Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015. I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there's no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees. They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there's war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia. So, why the EU carries out this open-door policy? You should ask the high-ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy. It's harming the EU, it's dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe. Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1.5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU - we don't even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not  - but if you speak like this, you're going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that 'migration equals terrorism', which you've never said. But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe. SS:I feel like Western countries could’ve presented a counter-argument - for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested - if I'm correct - a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren't refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy. So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it's a homegrown thing. PS:It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there's a massive influx of 1.5 mn people without knowing who they are - with opening green borders to them, saying 'please come on in', without controlling them - does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome. So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe - but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been 'double societies' or 'parallel societies' constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies. We have to speak about this openly. We think that this 'solution' based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it's totally against common sense. We have to be able to protect ourselves. We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that. SS:So let's talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that. Aren't you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? PS:No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior. If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end. So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary - we are a Schengen member-state, so if there's a decision that a number of ex-migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country - number one. Number two it's against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they're going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx. And, number three, it's breaking European regulations. These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling. SS:Just because this ""open door"" policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr. Orban, comes out and says ""bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide"" - I'm thinking, maybe, it's a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a ""national suicide""? PS:There are tricks in that. First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary. Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory. Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand. Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don't oblige... So,  these are tricks, and it's very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don't want it. SS:You've turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren't the only one - there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls... Is this the only way, to put up fences? PS:We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there's a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders - according to regulation. But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally. So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations. We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you're located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours - it even said, 'during opening hours'! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia - so no Schengen member states... There's no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations. You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said ""No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations!"" - then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly. So, it's tragic, I'll say. SS:Are you pro-Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures. What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? PS:We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it's a suicide for the European economy. European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting-sequence and adjusting-type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products. If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses. So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone. That's what we have been working on, and that's why we don't like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you're accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming. SS:You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe's security, especially Germany - is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? PS:Very minimum. The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border - you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it's not true, because we have border-crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country  - of course, respecting the regulations. When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries - Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower. Only three countries. SS:Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary. PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really ""goes against all European"", but he's still willing to take the risk. How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? PS:There's a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not. So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately. Because of European regulations  you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our  perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal. SS:I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump. EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington - do you think Orban's friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary's relations with the EU? PS:I don't think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he's the President of the U.S., and I see that there's a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it's not them, it's not liberal Western media, it's not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who's going to be the President of the U.S.. I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him ""as such a progressive, such a  wonderful, such a smart guy""!, but because it's Donald Trump, now he's bashed in every sentence, which I don't think would be fair and correct. Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it's American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow - but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar  to his position. SS:And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and... I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti-establishment forces, may not win this elections - do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? PS:There's a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it's no wonder - these are challenging times. There's a kind of fight or debate between two camps - sovereignists and federalists. We say - we belong to the sovereignists, of course -that European Union can only be strong if the member-states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels. If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU. All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union. The only question is - how to get there? Our position is that only strong member-states can lead to a strong European Union. SS:My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions - the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy - they don't want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that. Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U.S., these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe... PS:We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions. We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy. So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn't want to break the European unity - but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re-evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions. So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U.S. and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well. SS:Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview. Good luck with everything. PS:Thank you. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"25 Jan, 2017",RT critics admit promotion of Russian media threat is a money racket,"Regular readers of RT Editorial will know this column has provided evidence of how think tanks, which are increasingly indivisible from lobby groups, faithfully promote the specific agendas of their paymasters regardless of their stated high-minded missions. When it comes to Russia, most of these faux-academic concerns have primarily concerned themselves with whipping up hysteria about a supposed imminent military danger to Eastern Europe. Shocker: almost all of them arefundedby weapon manufacturers and entities like the US Department of Defense. In other words, the very people who need a bogeyman to justify heightened armed forces spending. However, convincing the general public that Moscow is going to overrun Europe has always been a hard sell. Mainly because Russia is not the USSR and its military spending is much smaller compared to NATO. For example, the Kremlin’s 2017defense budgetis around $45 billion. This compares to the $622 billion Washington hasprojectedfor the coming year. That does not include all the other NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, which recentlysigneda $125 billion contract with General Atomics, just for the supply of drones. Probably aware they needed a new schtick, in recent years, bodies like The Atlantic Council and the Center For European Policy Analysis have expanded messaging about the supposed Russian threat to the long-reigning mainstream media consensus. RT is, of course, the favorite target and scary monster. As a result, we see a kind of schizophrenic discourse where the network oscillates from being a huge danger to something nobody watches (but still is a cause for a cash call), depending on which agenda they are pushing on a given day. With this in mind, it was interesting to note Monday’s Guardianpiece, headlined “EU escalates its campaign against Russian propaganda,” for two reasons. Firstly, because the newspaper apparently couldn’t think of an example of“Russian propaganda”in an article about“Russian propaganda”and instead used a story promoted by an American website, to illustrate the purported Russian threat:“In recent weeks the unit (Stratcom East, an EU outfit dedicated to watching Russian news services) has been correcting a widely shared and entirely false story that claimed that a 1,000-strong mob chanting “Allahu Akbar” burned down Germany’s oldest church,”they wrote. This storyappearedon Breitbart, which is based in Los Angeles and is 100 percent American owned. Then they followed up, with“EU officials estimate that Russia spends $1bn (£801m) on state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik….”Quite why the EU needs to guess is beyond rational understanding, given how RT is transparent about its financing, which amounts to around $300 million this year, or less than a third of that appraisal. Not just that, but all media funding by the Russian state is widely publicized every year, and even adding up the RT and Sputnik budgets still amount to much less than half of the reported figure. So much for the MSM’s war on“fake news.” Just as the EU increased the strength of its “Stratcom East” annex from eleven staff to 19, and lobbed another €800,000 in its direction (because nearly $800 million for BBG and £289 million supplementary Defense & Security funding for BBC World Service clearly weren’t enough, not to mention the financial support for the likes of DW, France24, and Euronews to continue fighting the good fight), came a most enlightening conversation between a group of media ‘experts,’ specializing in the post-Soviet space. The event washostedby n-ost, a German advocacy group, funded by Washington’s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which has earned a bit of a reputation forpromoting“regime change”in countries independent of US foreign policy. The chat concerned whether“articles about Russian ‘propaganda’ now are more widely read than Russian 'propaganda’ itself.”Right now, you can take“Russian propaganda”to mean anything which offers an alternative view to the mainstream media consensus. At the roundtable were an interesting bunch of folk. Alexey Kovalev, formerly of RIA Novosti, was joined by Vladimir Soloviev of Moldova’s Newsmaker, which gets its cash from the European Endowment For Democracy (the EU’s version of NED) and Gemma Pörzgen, a board member of Reporters Without Borders, a concern funded by George Soros, NED and the EU Commission. As they spoke, our heroes seemed to realize how ridiculous the whole hysteria against Russian media has become. Pörzgen admitted that“in the case of Germany, for example, I think the problem is grossly exaggerated. Some so-called 'experts' have blown it up out of all proportion. There’s a lack of proper research on the subject that could provide an objective view. There’s a lot of propaganda around propaganda if you see what I mean.”Meanwhile, Kovalev conceded that (in Russia)“state TV channel budgets, both domestic and international, are being cut, projects are being wound down and so on.” It was toward the end of the discussion when things got fascinating when in this warm, relaxed echo-chamber atmosphere the brave info-warriors let it slip that their entire mission is essentially a money racket. Take Kovalev:“the battle with “Russian propaganda” has already turned into a fully-fledged industry in which many people, including myself, have had successful careers. It would be stupid to give them up because of the negligibility of our field of study. That’s one reason.” Soloviev:“I also see it as an industry, with budgets that need to be spent. In Moldova, the subject is a best seller on the internal political market. In 2015 the current Mayor of Chisinau (and deputy chair of the right-wing Liberal Party) won his third election thanks to the fact that he spent most of his election campaign fighting Russian tanks. But there’s nothing new about the city looking like the site of some kind of urban warfare.” Pörzgen:“You’re right there, Alexey. There are so many people in the market who used to cover security issues and have now lost their jobs. But now they’ve seen the chance to get back into business. There are also lobbying groups such as the Atlantic Council, who have started running conferences all over Europe on the same subject: “The rising influence of Russian propaganda.” And with that, you could have dropped the metaphorical mic. Because the same people who benefit, via funding for their projects, from stoking the fears of Russian domination of the information space, are acknowledging that it's fundamentally a gravy train.

"22 Jan, 2017",Trump’s ‘old friends become allies’ goal refers to Russia – Virginia state senator,"Trump’s intention is to end the provocative actions that the US took against Russia and normalize relations, Virginia State Senator Richard Black said, adding that this is a great time to draw back from war, unnecessary conflict, and regime change. Donald Trump's first full day as US president saw thousands marching in Washington, DC as a part ofthe Women’s March. So-called sister events were held across the globe. Organizers said they wanted to send Trump a message“that women's rights are human rights.” This followed violent and destructive protests that erupted across the US after Trump’s inauguration. In Portland, Oregon, demonstrators burned American flags. Other major cities saw violent clashes with police. RT:Were you surprised by these pretty much unprecedented protests? Richard Black:I am not surprised at all. There are people like George Soros who pay a great deal of money; I understand that many of these protesters have been paid $1,500 to $2,500 to attend. Most of the ones that I saw at the inauguration lacked energy, lacked passion... This is all just theatrics and it doesn’t mean anything. RT:Why do you think people are feeling anger that Donald Trump is now the president? RB:The Trump administration may bring about more dramatic change than we have ever seen in our lifetimes. And a great deal of that is going to be in the area of foreign policy. And I think that you are seeing some Republicans who are very nervous about what is going to happen, because he will fundamentally alter our foreign policy. RT:Do you think Trump can unify the country? In his speech, he certainly thought he could. RB:He will do that. We are still transitioning from the campaign, but there’s sort of a majesty that surrounds the presidency and very shortly you’ll see some of these other things fading away. They can only pay the protesters to be out there for so long. Interestingly, I looked at all of the protesters, almost all of them were white. There were very few Hispanics, Blacks. A very narrow group of people, and somehow they didn’t strike me as very genuine. Gilbert Doctorow, the European Coordinator of The American Committee for East-West Accord, commented on the post-inauguration protests in the US:“I’d like to put this into context; the opposition to Trump is of two varieties: one is what you are seeing in the streets. I would call that opposition from below kind of film extras – they are making a lot of noise and catching the TV cameras, but they are not really any threat to Trump’s presidency. But there is another type of opposition which is coming from above, which is of vital importance and existential threat to the Trump presidency... In Capitol Hill, there is a different type of opposition, and they are the ones to watch.” RT:Donald Trump set himself a big task; hesaidhe wants to do a certain amount of things within 100 days. Do you think the expectations will be too great to start producing results quickly? RB:I don’t think so. I think he can move quickly. He has already changed the presidential website. And he has changed the priorities for foreign affairs. It is interesting looking at some of the words: he said he wants more peace for the world, less conflict. He wants to find“more common ground.”His top priority is fighting ISIS and other terrorist groups. And he talked about joint military operations which, I presume, would mean alongside Russia. He wants to cut off funding for terrorist groups. Interestingly, he says he wants to“embrace diplomacy.”He says“we do not go abroad in search of enemies.”He said“we are happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies.” When he makes that reference to old friends becoming allies, I think he is referring specifically to Russia, which was our ally in the Second World War. And I think if you look at everything that he has said, I think it is his intention to end the provocative actions that we have been taking towards Russia, to normalize relations. I think this is a tremendous time. It is a time when we can draw back from war and unnecessary conflict, from regime change. He obviously has contempt for the old policy of regime change. So, I think it is a very hopeful time. RT:Can Trump create alliances with Iran and China? Because the rhetoric has been different from that [regarding] Russia... RB:It has been, and I think to some extent, we are going have to see how that plays out. I hope that there can be some normalization. The relations with China relate a great deal to our trading balance. And I think we are going to see a very tough position with China dealing with the trading balance. He is determined to return jobs to the US that have been sent overseas. So, there will be some inevitable tensions there. Iran is very much a mystery because there are some signals that perhaps we can cooperate at some level. But I think that remains to be seen exactly where we head with Iran. Obviously, he wants to stabilize Syria, he wants the Assad regime to remain in power. He wants the terrorists out...

"19 Jan, 2017",‘Stop Operation Soros’ movement begins in Macedonia,"A new initiative, Stop Operation Soros (SOS), dedicated to countering the influence of American billionaire activist George Soros, has been launched in Macedonia. In a press conference on Tuesday, the founders of the group called on all “free-minded citizens,” regardless of ethnicity or religion, to join them in the “fight against one-mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by George Soros,” the Vecer newspaper reported. The movement says it will first focus on uncovering ‘subversive’ activities by Soros-funded NGOs. According to Nikola Srbov, a columnist for pro-government news portal Kurir and co-founder of SOS, Soros-funded NGOs have monopolized civil society in Macedonia and used their position to suppress dissenting views. “We've witnessed the takeover of the entire civil sector and its abuse and instrumentalization to meet the goals of one political party. That is unacceptable and goes beyond the principles of civic organizing,”Srbovsaidat the press conference. “The Open Society Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, used its funding and personnel to support violent processes in Macedonia. It has monopolized the civil society sector, pushing outside any organization which disagrees with the Soros ideology,”he stated. Another co-founder, Cvetin Cilimanov, editor-in-chief of the state-run MIA news agency, accused Soros’s Open Society Foundations of undermining Macedonian sovereignty by working not only with the opposition center-left SDSM party, but also with outside interests. By cooperating with foreign embassies and organizations such as USAID, Cilimanov believes Soros-backed groups have interfered in the political process of Macedonia. “This is unacceptable and has largely contributed to a feeling in the public that the traditional relations of partnership Macedonia enjoyed with some countries are being undermined,”Cilimanovtoldjournalists. A third founder of the initiative and editor-in-chief of the Republika news portal, Nenad Mircevski, declared that the group would work towards the “de-Soros-ization” of Macedonia, echoing a speech made by former prime minister and leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party Nikola Gruevski in December. In the speech, Gruevski accused foreign powers and Soros-backed organizations of meddling in Macedonian politics. Opposition figures have expressed concern at the rhetoric used by Gruevski, fearing the start of a crackdown on dissent and advocacy groups. The Open Society Foundation (OSF) was set up by Hungarian-born Soros between the mid-1980s to early 1990s with the stated aim of helping former Eastern bloc countries transition from communism. However, aside from its support for progressive causes such as drug policy reform, the OSF has also been involved in political activities and Soros publically supported the violent overthrow of the legitimately-elected government in Ukraine during the ‘Euromaidan’ revolution. This has earned him the ire of Russian authorities, which in 2015 banned Soros and his foundations as a threat to national security. Soros and his foundations have come under scrutiny elsewhere as well. In an interview with the internet portal 888.hu in December, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that 2017 would bring about“the extrusion of George Soros and the forces symbolized by him.”Orban has accused Soros of undermining European borders and values by helping facilitate the flow of refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere. During a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange also blasted the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, funded by Soros, for focusing“exclusively on negative stories about Russia and former Soviet states.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"10 Jan, 2017",Assange blasts Soros & USAID over Russian propaganda campaign (VIDEO),"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed George Soros and the USAID funded the mainstream media’s framing of the Panama Papers scandal as part of a broader negative propaganda campaign against Russia in a ""Reddit Ask Me Anything"" on Tuesday. During theAMA, which was livestreamed via Twitch, the WikiLeaks editor explained he took issue with the fact that the Panama Papers revelations were framed as being all about Putin by the“usual idiots in the ruling class press.” READ MORE: '14-yr old kid could do it’- Assange on Podesta email hack The Putin angle was“pushed as the leading story”rather than focusing on the many Western figures who were implicated, with Assange mentioning David Cameron as an example, as part of an effort funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Soros.“That is no model of integrity”he said. What the hack?

Does the blighter ever take a break from acts of villainy? Well, that was the news in brief for 2016, as brought to you by ‘liberal’ and neocon media outlets in the West. Now let’s take a closer, month by month look at how the anti-Russia, anti-Putin hysteria built up. At the annual get-together for the world’s super-rich at Davos, billionaire regime-changer George SorosaccusesVladimir Putin of making the refugee crisis worse by intervening in Syria. He doesn’t mention the West’s deliberate destabilization of the country and backing for anti-government ‘rebels.’ Meanwhile, the US European Commandpublishesan ‘Updated Theater Strategy’ which lists deterring “Russian aggression” as its number one priority. It’s written by a General Breedlove, but given the document’s Cold War feel, ‘Dr Strangelove’ springs readily to mind. A newreportPropaganda in Orbit from the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), takes aim at what it calls Russia’s “campaign of disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe.” @georgegallowayThe US military-industrial complex, a 'non-partisan' think tank and Sputnik- my new piece@RT_comhttps://t.co/ppWj3c4opj Recent donors of the ‘non-partisan’ CEPA include: The US Department of Defense, Raytheon Company, Textron Systems, Sikorsky Aircraft, Bell Helicopter, and the Lockheed Martin Corporation. So no conflict of interest there, folks. George Soros meanwhilepublishesan article entitled “Putin is a bigger threat to Europe than ISIS.” Russian air power helps Syrian forces recapture the ancient city of Palmyra from ISIS. But UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond does not seem too happy. He calls a celebratory concert held in Palmyra in May, featuring leading Russian classical musicians, “tasteless.” The same Philip Hammond had, a few months earlier, called the downing by ISIS of a Russian plane full of tourists “a warning shot” to Moscow. READ MORE: A ‘warning shot’- The crazy logic of UK’s Hammond and what lies behind it In the US, if you fancy a break from watching politicians like John McCain lambaste Russia, there’s the premiere of the fourth season of the period drama series ‘The Americans,’ featuring two Soviet KGB agents posing as all-American citizens. It’s created and produced by former CIA officer Joe Weisberg – proving once again that in free societies in the West, geopolitics never comes into entertainment. US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter lists Russia – and not ISIS – as the No. 1 strategic threat.

Russia’s envoy to NATO, Alexsandr Grushko, says that the US is scaring Europe with a ‘mythical’ Russian threat to justify increasing defense spending. Despite breaching the contest’s own rules, a song from Ukraine about Stalin’s deportations of the 1940s wins Eurovision – helped by the votes of unelected juries. (Russia won the most votes from the public). Watch our 2015 profile of@jamalawho just won#Eurovisionsong contesthttps://t.co/VeirC15BrI#Ukraine NATO tweeted their approval, but of course Eurovision isn’t political. That’s just “Russian propaganda!” Meanwhile, NATO foreign ministers agree on the alliance’s biggestmilitary build-upfor decades in eastern Europe to counter ‘aggressive’ Russia.

We aretoldthe UK government suspects that the Russian hooligans weren’t just run-of-the-mill thugs – but (cue some really sinister, frightening music) had “Kremlin links” and were fighting Putin’s “hybrid warfare.” The violence in Marseilles leads to renewed calls for Russia to be stripped of the 2018 football World Cup. To put the boot in further, the EU agrees to extend sanctions on Russia for another six months. The Times newspaper, clearly trying to win an Olympic gold medal in Russophobia, runs seven anti-Russian media hit pieces (six of which attack RT), in just two and a half days at the end of the month and at the start of August. RT, according tothe angriestof the articles, was a “fake news channel” which had “no place on our screens.” The samewriterhad earlier denigrated RT as a station that hardly anyone watched. So why the obsession with writing about it, if no one was switching on? Meanwhile, The Atlanticasksthe ‘frightening’ question: “What if Russia invaded the Baltics and Donald Trump was President?” The Atlantic Councilwarnsthat Russia could invade Poland ‘overnight.’ No joke: US think-tank suggests cyber-attacks on Moscow Metro, St. Pete power grid, RT offices (Op-Edge)https://t.co/GItdee9FYu Thought you could enjoy the summer holidays without any nightmares? Not when there’s a ‘Russian threat’ to be promoted! Russians Paralympians are banned en masse from taking part in the Paralympics in Rio, depriving athletes who had never been found guilty of wrongdoing the chance of competing at a tournament they had spent four years preparing for. The British head of the IPC, Sir Philip Craven, said he was “greatly encouraged” by the decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to uphold the ban. Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said that “punishing innocent athletes” was a “flagrant violation of human rights.” Meanwhile, as The Donald’s presidential campaign gains momentum, top Kremlinologist Edward Lucasasksthe question: “Is Trump a Russian agent?” The Intercept reveals that US defense contractors have been telling investors that the so-called ‘Russian threat’ was good for business.

Former CIA director and Hillary Clinton supporter Michael Morell doesn’t just want Russians banned – hewants them killed. He says that Russians (and Iranians) in Syria should be killed ‘covertly,’ ‘to pay a price.’ As ‘Russian threat’ paranoia increases further in the US presidential election, Dr. Andrew Foxall of the neocon Henry Jackson Societywarnsthat despite major NATO military build-ups, Britain is still “ill-equipped” to deal with Russia. “The alliance simply isn’t doing enough to build up the range of capabilities necessary to deter an aggressive and resurgent Russia.” A new film version of Arthur Ransome’s classic children’s adventure Swallows and Amazons introduces two new characters who aren’t in the original novel. Guess what – they’re two Russian agents. Boris Johnson – now UK Foreign Secretary – calls for people to protest outside the Russian Embassy in London, having only a few months earlier – in a previous incarnation – called for Britain to work with Russia in Syria. Tory MP Andrew MitchelllikensRussian actions to the Nazis. George Soros accuses Putin of “heinous crimes against humanity.” Pro-war Labour MP John Woodcock, not to be outdone, calls for Russia to be stripped of hosting the World Cup. RT is given notice that its bank accounts will be closed in the UK, but The Times says this is not going far enough.  NATO forces meanwhile prepare for the biggest military build-up on Russia’s borders since the Nazi invasion of 1941. Remind me once again: Who’s threatening whom? Donald Trump wins the US Presidency, and neocons along with the faux-left go into meltdown over the prospect of improved relations with Russia in the New Year. An explanation for the shock defeat of Hillary Clinton soon emerges: Russian interference in the election! Why, it had to be! In a spirit of true McCarthyism, the Washington Post publishes ablacklistof websites accused of being ‘routine peddlers of Russian propaganda’ – including WikiLeaks, antiwar.com, and the Ron Paul Institute.

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US-Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia. If there were a 'hero of the year' list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders. Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian-led airstrikes. One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists. When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself - a decision that also took out the approaching enemy. John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko's single act of heroism when he wrote:""I don’t know Aleksandr Prochorenko. I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future. But I do know that he’s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one... Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism. У вызвавшего под Пальмирой огонь на себя Александра Прохоренко дома осталась беременная женаhttps://t.co/vBlfP1vN9Upic.twitter.com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that""NATO does not seek confrontation,""and that it is""everyone’s interest to avoid a new arms race,""the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever-closer to Russia's borders. However, as Pepe Escobarexplained,""The real “measure” is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week – plus a further one in Poland in 2018. This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s."" Putin emphasized that NATO's inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to""respond adequately""to any threat to its national interests. On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue. In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union’s ‘No Politics’ rules, the Ukrainian contestant, 'Jamala' (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II. Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision's rules. Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors:""The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year’s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles. We’ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 - an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them... ""For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!,""Clark concluded. via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is,""In God We Trust."" Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as 'The Satanic Temple (TST).' ""Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics,""Thranholm wrote.""TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000. One of the group's objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed “After School Satan”... Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC. The clubs will focus on “rationalism, free inquiry… and fun”,according to a promotional video. Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from 'God Country':""Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives. A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God..."" Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US-led countries continued with their regime-change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from  war-torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria. Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe's welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms. In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, 'Why I’m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants,' that begins:“The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration. Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad. Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families.” Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros' plan will reap positive benefits. via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the""forced migration""caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it:""If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel’sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros-funded organizations."" This is cultural- and ethnic-cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi-purpose war – one designed to destroy oil-rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states,""Gerrans concluded. The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber - if not outright disastrous - outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance. Following news that Germany's Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy. Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded:""Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it. A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems. And if Deutsche Bank has to fail – that is the end of it. In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII."" His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice. The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign. No more. In a highly controversial move, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping. Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted. In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete. This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness. During the women’s 100m breaststroke final, 19-year-old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia’s Yulia Efimova took the silver. However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat. As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King’s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival’s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova’s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony. ""Let’s deal with some facts here,""Cunningham continued.""Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years. So much then for claims of “Russian state-sponsored doping”. Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances. ""Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium... The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance-enhancing drug only in January of this year."" In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances. The US anti-doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims. As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia’s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara. Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add 'insult to injury.' As Bryan MacDonaldexplained:""Following the appalling murder of Russia’s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov... two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it’s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency. The reader will be able to discern the line of 'reasoning' in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York’s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone:""Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin’s war crimes.” In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov's murder:“Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs,""Whitmore tells us.""So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime. It could also turn out to be a harbinger.” As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places""all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination. For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries."" In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump's landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back-door machinations. Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The idea didn't seem so wild at the time for a ""Clinton coup"" as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306-232), he failed to win the popular vote - reportedly by 2.5 million votes. Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton - in similar fashion to George W. Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court - could steal the White House from Trump. ""This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes,""Bridgewrote.In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place. And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility – and a very high one in this particular battle - of so-called ""faithless electors""tipping this contest in Clinton’s favor. Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton - an unlikely yet possible scenario - Trump went on to formally secure the vote - and the presidency - on December 19. via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything - from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election - on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire. Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor:""Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with “high confidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “personally involved” in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin’s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a “vendetta” against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times.... The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially-designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still-ongoing hacking operations from the air. Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough. It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers. On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war. Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace. Happy New Year!

"19 Dec, 2016",POTUS-picking: Electoral College under intense focus in controversial election year,"The 538 select Americans that will gather at state capitols across the US on Monday, who are expected to officially pick Donald Trump as the 45th US president, are now facing calls by Trump’s opponents to disregard the election results. The arcane and often ceremonial institution has received more attention than usual in this controversial presidential election year, when every election process from closed primaries to recounts has received extra scrutiny. The electors are nominated by the political parties in each state and in Washington, DC. Each presidential candidate has their own unique set of potential electors in each of the states. When Americans voted on November 8, they weren’t directly voting for the candidates whose names appeared on the ballot, but rather for an elector to go to the Electoral College on December 19 and vote for their candidate. Currently, 306 electors are pledged to vote for Republican President-elect Donald Trump and 232 are pledged to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Voting is conducted between 9am and 3pm, with the vote expected to be called shortly before 6 pm. There has been much discussion over whether Electoral College members could decline to vote, vote for another candidate, or switch party allegiance after Donald Trump, a Republican candidate who was critically denounced by leading members of his own party throughout the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious. There was also the suggestion that Hillary Clinton’s remarkable lead of 2.8 million in the popular vote might affect the outcome of the Electoral College vote. 'If Electoral College votes against Trump, US will get worst constitutional crisis in its history' (Op-Edge)https://t.co/zXrUFFDmD9pic.twitter.com/Dg2x7cKlPf There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote according to the results in their states. However, 29 states do have laws stating just that. Despite that fact, no elector has ever been prosecuted for what is referred to as “faithless” voting. “Refusal or failure to vote for the candidates for president and vice-president appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party which nominated the elector constitutes a resignation from the office of elector, his vote shall not be recorded and the remaining electors shall forthwith fill the vacancy,”the Michigan law reads. Apart from the state laws, Democrats and others hoping to encourage Republican dissenters to switch their vote or decline to vote have been intensely focused on the Electoral College voters. Here are the top three: In a video lasting just two minutes and 23 seconds, a roster of Hollywood actors that includes Martin Sheen, who played a president in the popular TV series“West Wing,”appealed to Republican Electoral College members, asking 37 of them not to vote for President-elect Donald Trump. Thirty-seven is the new magic number, as if 37 of Trump’s 306 electors do not vote for him, he would have only 269 electoral votes – one short of a majority. If that happens, and it is a long shot, and neither Trump nor Clinton receives a majority of the electoral votes – then the House of Representatives would decide who becomes president.Unite for America, which sponsored the video, appears to be a new Super PAC – a type of independent political action committee that can raise unlimited sums of money, but can’t contribute directly to a candidate. Although it has yet to send an account of its disbursement to the Federal Elections Commission, early indicators show that the fund is somehow tied to MoveON.org, a Soros-backed Democratic-friendly political fund. According toHarvard professor Larry Lessig, there may be as many as 20 members who are least considering not voting for Trump. The one member who has gone public is Christopher Suprun of Texas, who has said that, since his announcement, he has received email in support, but also death threats. He said he will vote for another Republican because Trump“chose to stoke fear and create outrage.” Hillary Clinton Has Grounds To Challenge Constitutionality Of Electoral College- Become POTUS, Harvard Expert Sayshttps://t.co/PKLDZIp8Io He also admits there’s a chance he could be wrong about Trump.“If Donald Trump turns out to be the next Ronald Reagan, great. Maybe history will prove me wrong. I would welcome that. But we won’t know if I was right to do this or not until 20 years from now,”hetoldHouston Press.“I’ve made a decision, and it’s not necessarily a popular one, but I have to do what I think is right.” Several Electoral College electors resigned to avoid casting their votes for Trump, and at least seven more – Democrats in Colorado and Washington State who call themselves the Hamilton Electors – will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and cast protest votes for a candidate not named. These Hamilton Electors are planning to try to convince Republican electors to vote for a third candidate in the hope that this may put the Electoral College into deadlock or result a different candidate being elected. ‘Here to elect a president, not a king’: Rep. Electoral College voter refuses to back Trumphttps://t.co/JQiEAQIYbspic.twitter.com/3BZNdHv6hD Another Texas elector, Art Sisneros, stepped down from his position rather than vote for Trump, but all that did was promote another Trump elector to vote in his place. Electors who are to cast their votes for Trump say that they are being harassed. Michigan Electoral College member Michael Banerian told RT that he has received“hundreds and hundreds of e-mails, Facebook messages, and letters to my home about four or five a day, tweets.” “And in some messages, unfortunately, there were death wishes and generally angry messages from people who can’t accept the results of the US election,”he said. Earlier, in interviews with the US media, Banerian claimed that he had received death threats saying“I’m going to put a bullet in the back of your mouth,”and other ill wishes, such as“I hope you die” or “do society a favor and throw yourself in front of a bus.” Texas’ elector Alex Kim, who also says he has received threats, told the US media that he responds with a simple message:“You may all go to hell, and I shall go to Texas.” Clay Pell, a Democrat Electoral College member from Rhode Island, has led the charge with nine other electors, including one  Republican, who say that the election process has been tarnished by Russian interference and are asking for more information before casting their votes on Monday. This week, he sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper demanding a briefing. The letter has now received 20 signatures. “We as electors have a narrow role, but nonetheless it’s a role in protecting the integrity of the election,”Pell told reporters this week, according to AP. During his year-end press conference at the White House, President Obama blamed the highest levels of the Russian government for hacking the Democratic National Committee and the emails of its chair, John Podesta. Obama said that he had confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin “directly""about the matter when meeting with him in China in September. The US leader reportedly told Moscow“to cut it out,”and apparently, since then, Washington“didn’t see further tampering of the election process.” However, by then, WikiLeaks had already begun publishing the DNC leaks, Obama added, saying that the media“wrote about it every day.” However, the majority of Americans voters said inlast week’s pollthat the leaked information that the Obama administration claims came from cyber-attacks conducted by Russia had no real effect on the election’s outcome.

"18 Dec, 2016",‘Next they’ll be saying Russians are coming to eat our babies!’,"We should be talking to the Russians. And I for one, and many of my listeners here in Britain do not believe that Russia is the enemy, Jon Gaunt, radio host, told RT. Martin Summers, independent journalist and commentator, also contributed his thoughts. Russia and Syria could allegedly be orchestrating sex-attacks by refugees to sabotage the German parliamentary elections in September next year, according to a recent report put out by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The ECFR is a Soros-funded think tank of which the billionaire was a founding Council member. It cites an ""expert"" of the pan-European think-tank, insinuating that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself is involved in the plot. RT:Putin, Assad, Saddam, refugees, sex-attacks and elections... quite a mix. What do you make of this story? Martin Summers:Frankly, it sounds like the silly season, doesn’t it? I think the level of idiocy in Western propaganda attempts to smear Russia. Any objective person can surely tell that this is exaggerated mummery; it is not to be taken seriously – this is the pantomime season. ""Not much gets done in#Russiawithout Vladimir#Putin,""#Obamasays at final end-of-year presserhttps://t.co/h155vTUliLpic.twitter.com/6Ir79DuQU5 RT:The report cites a single individual belonging to a pan-European think-tank, as the source. Is that enough to justify such provocative headlines? MS:There are all sorts of academic think tanks and whatever out there, and… who is the Pan-European think tank? And we could probably just look it online and find who funds them and so on. I imagine they’ve got some corporate sponsorship of some kind. What is very interesting is that all the different media outlets in the West pick up each other’s stories. When you ask them what are the sources, they say: “Well, it came from somebody else. We got it from them, they’ve got it from somebody else…” What they are doing is they are feeding into the 24-hours news feed with these tidbits of political propaganda. The idea that President Putin is sitting down orchestrating refugees sex-attacks in Germany – I think that rates a‘Hmm,’don’t you? Is that a serious kind of allegation to make? RT:In the UK, it's being reported Vladimir Putin's spies have launched a campaign to target Britain with cyber-attacks. The Russian president is being portrayed as quite the spymaster these days, isn’t he? MS:Well because of his intelligence service background… of course he is the KGB man. George H. W. Bush was ex-head of the CIA, nobody said anything about that. The fact is that Vladimir Putin is being presented as this kind of evil Svengali like Fu Manchu, but manipulating everything in Western politics. The fact of the matter is: the Russian President has got an awful a lot to do – just managing and running Russia and managing various affairs he needs to deal with. Trying to stick his finger into a US presidential election – even if it was possible - is not really a very sensible thing to be claiming. It is just doesn’t have any credibility to my mind at all. Clinton blames FBI director &#Russiafor her defeathttps://t.co/6Rc6dFKxQTpic.twitter.com/jGoIzbNXgT RT:Nigel Farage had this to say about another recent allegation against Russia - of involvement in Brexit. Is it really hysteria or are these accusations actually based on something? MS:Well, there is a Labor MP who claimed that the Brexit vote was fixed by Russian interference in the Brexit election. This is picking up on the sort of things that are being said in the US. Frankly, that is absurd. I was a‘Remain’voter, I wasn’t a Brexit voter, but the idea that the Russians somehow fixed the result is La-La Land, really. We’ve now got senior people, like the former head of MI6, Richard Dearlove, coming out with what I would call not serious allegations. And the more the Western media pushes this kind of not serious allegations line, which they seem to be determine to do, then in fact in the world public opinion they are going to lose badly. Jon Gaunt, host, from talk2meradio.com RT:Putin, Assad, Saddam Hussein, refugees, sex-attacks and elections... quite a mix. What do you make of it all? Jon Gaunt:It’s called propaganda – simple as that. It would appear that the EU is very unhappy about the fact that Britain democratically decided to get out of the EU. They are unhappy that people in America decided to vote for Trump and not Hillary Clinton. So they start off with these ridiculous stories that Vladimir Putin and the Russians tried to steer the American election. Now we’ve got an MP standing up in the mother of all parliaments – Ben Bradshaw in London – and saying the Russians affected the Brexit decision. Next they will telling us that the Russians are going to come and eat our babies. It’s completely and utterly ridiculous. It’s stupid, it’s base propaganda. And the majority of people in Britain from what I’m hearing, when I listen to my listeners on Talk2Me Radio and on other phone-in shows here in the UK – the British population is seeing straight through this. This is pure propaganda. The EU needed a new enemy. They’ve decided that new enemy is Vladimir Putin and so they are poking him with the biggest stick they can find. And it is frankly ridiculous. #Obama: ‘Reagan would roll over in his grave’ at GOP support of#Putinhttps://t.co/1AJHptEKatpic.twitter.com/MzbqXwzXNf RT:In the UK, it's being reported Vladimir Putin's spies have launched a campaign to target Britain with cyber-attacks. The Russian president is being portrayed as quite the spymaster these days. What do you make of it? JG:It wouldn’t even make the theme, would it, for James Bond movie. They are trying to make out Putin is this enemy. I think Donald Trump has got it right when he says:“Let’s talk to Putin.”We clearly got to talk to Putin, rather than poking him. Obama, the other day was saying:“Oh, there will be repercussions”for what he alleges Putin did. Well, he is one step away from the golf course. I would suggest that Barack Obama, the worse president we’ve had in the US in recent history, to take that walk: go on the golf course and get off the political scene. Let Donald Trump, somebody who’s done business, get on with business. I suggest that we in the West should be talking to your president; we should be talking to the Russians. And I for one, and many of my listeners here in Britain do not believe that Russia is the enemy. There is a front-page splash today in one of our - I think the second biggest newspaper tabloid - that is essentially saying that Russia is involved in all these plots, and that Putin is somehow, as I say, a James Bond villain masterminding all this. It just doesn’t add up. We had all this before the referendum. There was a thing called Operation""Fear,”where the establishment elite in this country tried to scare the British public to vote to stay in the EU.

"18 Dec, 2016",Facebook’s 'anti-fake news' plan looks like effort to curb alternative media,"There are serious concerns over a social media giant's plans to debunk spurious news stories. And many are puzzled about the real agenda at play. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv You don’t need to worship at the altar of George Orwell to see where this is going. Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as’fake news’on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content. While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it's proposed to implement it merits many questions. Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country’s popular press. But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering. Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook. In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg’s firm is an effective monopoly. CIA meddled in ‘hundreds’ of elections: Ron Paul talks Russia-blaming, fake news and more on RThttps://t.co/qxttAcpYSmpic.twitter.com/1kd44g8AVH Whereas papers have always been curated by editors, their power was limited by the sheer number of competitors in every national market. And the more different they were, the better for society in general. However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary. Of course, another big problem here is that one person’s“fake news”could be another’s truth. And that’s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves. To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self-proclaimed“international fact-checking network,”which presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity. Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing. They include Pierre Omidyar,George Sorosand Washington’s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft-power cutout. As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine’s Maidan coup in 2014. Thus, it’s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of“ministry of truth”with only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington’s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook’s primary news feeds. And this is very dangerous. Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact-checkers to sort out ‘fake news’https://t.co/jZmZXrpl06pic.twitter.com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter’s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling. Because it’s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices. That said, nobody is disputing whether“fake news”is a problem. It’s just hard to find agreement on its definition. For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it's often a different story. Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non-mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked bynumerouscrediblesources. And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging thatVladimir Putinwas using“kompromat”to destroy the reputations of his political opponents. For'proof'they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography. German politicians want €500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrshttps://t.co/VSGNiA2M98pic.twitter.com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper's readers were greeted with this soft-soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins:“His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K.G.B. and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride.”And to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes. Yet, sadly for Higgins - and Bukovsky, of course - his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child pornimageshimself, as""research."" Then there’s theGuardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth. A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune - without any explanation - suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the sameWashington Post. These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source. And we can’t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times. Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of alove childand Moscow developing a Star Trek-esqueteleportation device. Are all these not examples of“fake news?”But given that they are establishment names in the western press, don’t expect Poynter to subject them to the same treatment as newer alternative outlets. And this is the problem with the entire exercise. Credible or fake? Journalists clash in fiery RT debate on news sources in#Syria(VIDEO)https://t.co/ibunqPmH1Vpic.twitter.com/qLtwXN45j7 The list of signatories to the InternationalFact-CheckingNetwork also sets alarm bells ringing. For they include some fairly dubious organizations. TakePolitifact, for example. This group has been accused of having a left-wing bias and openly favoring Clinton during the US election campaign. As Breitbart observed:“When Trump said Clinton wants “open borders,” PolitiFact deemed his statement “mostly false” — despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013. “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” she said at the time.” ‘Intolerable & dangerous’:#AuschwitzCommittee accuses#Facebookof turning blind eye to hate speechhttps://t.co/GGY63iSnbTpic.twitter.com/YKcwlOujvk There is no doubt that blatantly made up, let alone poorly fact-checked, stories are poisoning political discourse. And Facebook is right to tackle the type of companies who produce twaddle such as“Hillary invented the Aids virus”or“Trump wants to distribute Mein Kampf to school kids""or whatever nonsense is being pushed today. However, will it also censure“respected”mainstream outlets who allege that Putin has stolen $200 billion for himself or is planting child porn on dissidents? Because unless they are also labelled with the“fake news”badge, this looks more like an exercise in the US liberal establishment trying to gain control of the distribution of news on social media, as they once did with newspapers and broadcasters. Orwell might have called it a sort of“Minitrue.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"30 Nov, 2016",Saving Poroshenko? US State Dept offers $800k to Ukraine NGOs,"Washington is offering a grant of up to $800,000 to Ukrainian public organizations that will monitor regional authorities and secure ties with local media. Political analysts say it’s a way to keep President Petro Poroshenko in power amid declining popularity. “[The] goal is to enhance the accountability and responsiveness of the Ukrainian government at the local level through civil society advocacy, monitoring, and civic activism,”reads a US State Department funding announcement, published this week on thegrants.govwebsite. It explains further that the State Department is looking for “civil society organizations,”either non-profit or for-profit (with some conditions) that will provide proposals “to perform a watchdog function and advocate for democratic governance”in Ukraine. The description states the program is aimed at increasing civic activism in Ukraine at a local level and building and training a network of civic activists throughout the country. These in turn are to keep watch on the activities of local governments and encourage partnerships between civil society and media“to communicate important information about local reforms to the public.” The organizations applying for the grant must present a program for their activities, along with a financial plan, by January 17, 2017. They are also required to have ties with “thematic or in-country partners, entities and relevant stakeholders, including private sector partners and NGOs”and provide proof of these links or their potential development. The description states that applicants are also requested to have “demonstrable experience in administering successful, and preferably similar, projects.” It adds that: “Projects should have the potential to have an immediate impact leading to long-term sustainable reforms, and should have potential for sustainability beyond DRL (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor of the State Department) resources.” READ MORE: Ukrainian Maidan coup leaders must testify before court – ousted President Yanukovich Among other things, the bureau says it welcomes projects that “advance the rights and uphold the dignity of the most vulnerable or at-risk populations,” with one of the criteria for the selection of candidates being their cooperation with minority groups. The State Department reserves a significant role for itself in the implementation of the program that receives the grant. It will, for instance, demand quarterly reports on the program’s spending and progress. Experts believe that this and other such funding opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country’s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko. The Ukrainian leader’s public approval ratings have plunged recently. According toLiga.Net, in November Poroshenko’s rating drew 14.3 percent of popular support – having plummeted to a low of 10.7 percent in summer. He is still behind former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings. Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: “The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine’s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget. “In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country. In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections,” Shlyamin believes. He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko's leadership, with his promises to introduce visa-free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption proving a failure. “Under Poroshenko, Ukraine has so far been unable to secure European Union and NATO membership. In domestic policy [there have been] also continuous failures,”Shlyamin told RT Russian. He believes the current grant is one of the final efforts by US President Barack Obama’s administration to maintain US-Ukraine relations as they have been since the coup in 2014. “Obama will soon leave office. Therefore, he needs to have time to allocate the necessary financial resources to continue the current policy and prevent future president Donald Trump from building a new line of cooperation with Ukraine,”he says. Some, like film director Oliver Stone, have called the Maidan revolution of 2014 aUS-staged coup, while former US Congressman Ron Paulcalledon foreign actors - like Washington, NATO or Moscow - to stay out of the country. READ MORE: Coups for export: US has history of supporting anti-govt upheavals In 2015, Sputnik news agency reported that the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) – a bureau much like the DRL, which is offering the current grant – played a significant role in the preparation of the Kiev coup. From 2011 to 2014 it wassaidto have given some $14 million to Ukrainian NGOs which facilitated media coverage of mass demonstrations and organized youth movements. After much speculation on the US role in the upheaval of 2014, President Obama last year openlyadmittedto having a hand in the events, or in his words “broker[ing] a deal to transition power in Ukraine.” Shlyamin’s colleague Sergey Sudakov said that, given its political significance, a major grant like the one currently being advertised for Ukraine is likely to end up in the hands of someone trusted by Washington, such as billionaire investor George Soros. “The government must be sure of the loyalty of those who are entrusted with such projects. After all, their goal [is] espionage and site preparation for the implementation of pro-American policy,” he said. Experts say that under Obama, Washington has been striving to gain full control over Ukraine – a strategically important region due to its location close to Russia. Shlyamin noted that in this “struggle for Kiev,” Washington has been pursuing “soft force,” introducing US democratic values through methods such as education and cultural training. Indeed, the US government has been known toallocatelarge sums to work with Ukrainian media, businesses and civil society activists. Last year, Victoria Nuland, the State Department’s top diplomat for Europe, acknowledged that since 1991 America has poured $5 billion of taxpayers’ money into what she said was assisting Ukrainians in building “democratic skills and institutions.” Grants were distributed through the DRL, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), with the money going to sponsor various NGOs, political parties and media outlets. However, Ukraine is not the only country whose internal affairs Washington is keen on being closely involved in. Just two months ago it emerged that USAID hadassigned$3 million to Russian non-governmental entities, according to data posted on government websiteusaspending.gov. The organization, which was banned in Russia in 2012 as “undesirable,” announced the funding opportunity just as Russia was preparing to hold parliamentary elections. The investment was listed under the heading ‘For activity in Russia,’ set to be completed by 2017. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"18 Nov, 2016",US spent $585mn on ‘promoting democracy’ worldwide in past year,"Washington invested $585 million in promoting democracy across the globe in the past year, the US Department of State’s financial report for fiscal year 2016 revealed. According to thepaper, the State Department’s total assets equaled $93.8 billion in the last fiscal year, which concluded on September 30, increasing by $3.2 billion compared to 2015. Of this amount, $585 million was spent by the State Department under the article ‘Democracy, human rights and governance’ – $70 million down on the 2015 figure. The report didn’t specify the projects funded by the agency abroad, but Secretary of State John Kerry wrote in the preface that“we have supported important democratic gains in Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Burma.” Kerry also stressed that“in an era of diffuse and networked power, we (the US) are focusing on strengthening partnerships with civil society, citizen movements, faith leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, and others to promote democracy and good governance and address gender-based violence.” In later pages, the authors of the report explained that the State Department promotes democratic values because“stable democracies are less likely to pose a threat to their neighbors or to the US.” Washington achieves its goals through leveraging trade agreements, pursuing meaningful sanctions, fostering people-to-people ties and encouraging responsible business conduct, which respects human and labor rights, the paper said. According to the report, the State Department always back those who strive for justice and accountability in“post-conflict states.” “Activists and organizations in authoritarian countries rely on our support as they work toward peaceful democratic reforms, democratic institutions, respect for minority rights, and dignity for all,”it stressed. Prior to the Russian parliamentary election in September, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which works closely with the State Department, allocated $3 million to non-governmental organizations in Russia. The investment was listed under the heading""For activity in Russia"", according to government website US Spending. Since June, Russia has banned over a dozen NGOs from operating in the country as“undesirable”foreign groups. READ MORE: John McCain NGO banned as ‘undesirable group’ in Russia The Soros Foundation, the US National Endowment for Democracy and Senator John McCain’s International Republican Institute were among the outlawed organizations. “Today Russia faces its strongest attack in the past 25 years, targeting its national interests, values and institutes,”the Russian Senate said in its ruling. “[The attack’s] main goal is to influence the internal political situation in the country, undermine the patriotic unity of our people, undermine the integration processes within the CIS space and force our country into geopolitical isolation,”the ruling added. Russian President Vladimir Putin also criticized Washington for its attempts to democratize foreign states via military or other means. READ MORE: Foreign Ministry praises law banning undesirable foreign groups in Russia “I’ve always been of the opinion that you can’t change things from the outside, regarding political regimes, power change,”Putin said in September. “I’m sure – and the events of the past decade add to this certainty – in particular the attempts of democratization in Iraq, Libya, we see what they led to: the destruction of the state system and the rise of terrorism,”the president said.

"15 Nov, 2016","US should sanction Soros & Poroshenko for destabilizing Ukraine, says Russian MP","A Russian lawmaker suggests that if the United States really wants to punish those responsible for the continuing crisis in Ukraine it should slap sanctions on billionaire George Soros, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and a number of US officials. Andrey Kozenko (United Russia) made the comment soon after the US Treasury Department announced that it was introducing sanctions against several Russian lawmakers representing the Crimean Republic, including Kozenko himself on the grounds of their alleged input in destabilizing Ukraine. “If this is the real reason behind the sanctions, I would advise that clerks in the Treasury Department slap sanctions on Nuland, Soros and Biden before January 20 [the end of the current US administration],” he said. Victoria Nuland is an assistant to the US secretary of state, whom the mass media describe as a mastermind behind the Ukrainian regime change in 2014. Joe Biden is the current US vice-president, who has a deep involvement in Ukrainian affairs (Biden’s son Hunter heads the largest private energy company in that country). George Soros is a US billionaire known for his involvement in international politics, in particular the backing of the so called ‘color revolutions’ – the seizing of power from nationalist-inclining regimes in favor of pro-globalist forces. Kozenko added that in his view sanctions for de-stabilizing Ukraine should be applied to the top Kiev officials, including President Petro Poroshenko, former PM Arseny Yatsenyuk and Interior Minister Arsen Avakov. A number of Western nations, including the US and EU members, first introduced sanctions against Russian officials and major companies soon after the political crisis in Ukraine developed into a military conflict between pro-Russian southeastern regions and pro-Kiev military and volunteer units. Russia responded with a food embargo against the nations that supported the sanctions. Both sides have prolonged and expanded the restrictions several times.

"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro-Clinton supporter. In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton's particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4-8 years of US-led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms. The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton's War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes,""What's the point of having this superb military... if we can't use it?""And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq - which was half a million dead Iraqi children - was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded,""We think the price is worth it."" Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball:""Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government.

"" Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia's (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the""real scandal""of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange's torturous, slow-drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind-boggling list of 'poor decision-making.' ""The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics,""Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans 'nothing to look at here, please move on.' Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails. This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal. The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton's chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them. Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump's victory chances on Nov.8th. And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous. But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do. With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders. That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that. Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton-Trump CNN-hosted debate. The jaw-dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate-style investigation. By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either. But that's mere child's play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group. US Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad. Clinton's leaky emails point to""the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails,""the WikiLeaks co-founder said.""There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone,""he added. Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration. So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of 'collateral damage' in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked. Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents. Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We'll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr. Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony. In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub. Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body. Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference,“Right now, we have more questions than answers.” Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich - as opposed to Russia - was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr. Rich. ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as""yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered—at dawn—as he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails."" Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild ""conspiracy theories,"" yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about""Russian involvement""in the WikiLeaks. Although it may be perfectly true that Mr. Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower. Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence. Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said:“There was no indication that any insider was involved in this... Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government—the Russians."" When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America's global military footprint if elected president, neo-conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party. Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American-style fascism. Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election. What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals - like George W. Bush and, yes, Barack Obama - who pledge to continue America's wars of expansion and empire. Clinton's past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to""Make America Great Again.""Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools. Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures. Assange ‘sorry for Clinton as a personality’ (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t.co/6Yw748WCnbpic.twitter.com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A. Mussomeli - in the Washington Post, of all places - really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump:""Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al-Assad in Syria, are frightened... But what really troubles them is [Trump's] generally level-headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs... Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep’s clothing — just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf’s clothing."" Anne Applebaum, perennial anti-Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange's work with groundless accusations:""Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen. Philip Breedlove and probably others. The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U.S. democratic process and, again, the “elite” who supposedly run it."" Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton. Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum's diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess. Albright claimed that Russia seeks to""undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious.""The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr. Assange, the value of that statement for themselves. So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton's rat-infested ship once and for all. We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again. @Robert_Bridge  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"3 Nov, 2016",What does it take to bring Hillary Clinton to justice?,"Virtually the whole planet holds its collective breath at the prospect of Hillary Clinton possibly becoming the next President of the United States (POTUS). How’s that humanly possible, as the (daily) Bonfire of The Scandals – relentlessly fed by WikiLeaks revelations and now converging FBI investigations - can now be seen from interstellar space? It’s possible because Hillary Clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole US establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon War Party/Wall Street/corporate media axis. But History has a tendency to show us there’s always a straw that breaks the camel’s back. This could be it – asrevealed by WikiLeaks; March 2, 2015, the day when John Podesta wrote,“we are going to have to dump all those emails.” BREAKING: WikiLeaks releases 26th batch of#PodestaEmailsfrom Clinton campaign chairhttps://t.co/3EXeP1ejJa That happened to be the exact same day it wasrevealedHillary Clinton had used a personal email server as Secretary of State. Yet this reveals only part of the puzzle. There’s got to be a response to Podesta’s email – which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then we’ve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative – according to which Hillary just deleted""personal""emails – crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards. Moreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept. and FBI investigations. As far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress – a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis.DCLeaks.com, for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors.) Assange ‘sorry for Clinton as a personality’ (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t.co/6Yw748WCnbpic.twitter.com/Abf0VFg6zy The perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture. To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to“evil”Russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might havecome straight fromthe belly of the (Washington) beast. At the Valdai discussion club last week, ittook President Putinonly a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang: “Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth. Hillary Rodham#Clintoncampaign blames Russian hackers as Julian#Assangepromises more leakshttps://t.co/rdfAB0F0XZ I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.” Reality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency. Anthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream mediaacknowledginghow Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of“philantro-capitalism”(actually a money laundering“pay to play”racket), a practice“by no means confined to the Clintons”. And the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary beingperfectly awarethat prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations - all three of them. Exhibit A is thisWikiLeaks bombshell; Peter Kadzik, who’s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset. ‘Process has begun’:#FBIscouring 650k emails on#Clintonaide’s laptop in reopened casehttps://t.co/l6cThxdWv1pic.twitter.com/oPmgO2WJzI Not only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta – as also revealed by WikiLeaks - thanked Kadzik for keeping him“out of jail”; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secretheads upon the Clinton email investigation. The Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. Huma and her family’s close connections to Saudi Arabia – and the Muslim Brotherhood – are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi). Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that’s part of the Clinton Foundation connection. Yet now, with Huma in the spotlight – still maintaining she didn’t know all those emails were in her and Wiener’s laptop - it’s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to“one of my aides”.She used to beHillary’s ersatz“daughter”; now she’s being framed as The Fall Princess. And that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary’s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI’s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener’s sexting of minors. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now. Let’s try to cut a long story short. Last July, the DOJ – under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate. And yet FBI director Comey – who nonetheless stressed Hillary’s“extreme carelessness”– turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI“sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe.” Soon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation. The East District of New York refused it. Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch. Enter an extra layer of legalese. Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements. But then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner’s sexting of a 15-year-old girl. Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts – fromHumaabedin@yahoo.comto the crucialhuma@clintonemail.com.  This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the“secret”clintonemail.com to Huma at yahoo.com. No one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements. What’s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined. Now picture both teams of FBI investigators – Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener – comparing notes. And then they decide Huma’s emails are“relevant”. BREAKING:#PodestaEmails25: WikiLeaks releases latest batch of Clinton emailshttps://t.co/5Xe0ziOAdFpic.twitter.com/D8R12iQUFX Key questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed“relevant”if the investigators could only examine the metadata. What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails – a potential game-changer. That’s why one of my sourcesinsistshis decision to go public came from above. The other key question now is whether the DOJ – via Kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation. Senior, serious FBI agents won’t take that – massive euphemism – kindly. The FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year. Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence – and they won’t quit. Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton’s Bonfire of Scandals’ problems.

"28 Oct, 2016",Western lynch mob on Russia ties itself up in absurd knots,"The Western lynch mob-like campaign to ‘get Russia’ goes on, with the gathering this week of the United Nations Human Rights Council. By trying to suspend Russia from the council, the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize. is an award-winning journalist. For over 25 years, he worked as a sub-editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain's Independent, among others. is an award-winning journalist. For over 25 years, he worked as a sub-editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain's Independent, among others. The 47-member UNHRC, based in Geneva, is the United Nations’ premier inter-governmentalforumon human rights. Members are selected on a rotational basis. On Friday, 14 seats on the council are up for renewal. This week 80 mainly Western non-governmental organizations associated with human rightsreportedlyurged the UNHRC to drop Russia’s membership, citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of Aleppo. Over 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syriahttps://t.co/uKTfWXWOLn Among the anti-Russia lobby were US-based and George Soros-funded Human Rights Watch. Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia. The campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain – also a member of the council – convened a summit in Geneva. The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces. Russia’s permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkinrebukedthe UNHRC for a one-sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria. He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and France, along with Gulf Arab states, which lobbied for the resolution. Radar data proves Belgian F-16s attacked village near Aleppo, killing 6 - Russian militaryhttps://t.co/Aj8mgT39ripic.twitter.com/XHU4ljZb4H These states have been arming and funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011. They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country – in the name of “fighting terrorism” – which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes. In recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties. So, of course, Western-orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality. The contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug-abuse charges, or the pseudo-probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe. We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligenceagenciesthat Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next month. Saudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Councilhttps://t.co/sqWeSwjg48#UNHR#SaudiArabia#humanrights The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia. Perhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats. That Saudi Arabia – widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth – is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat,according todocuments released last year by WikiLeaks. A Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes. Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen. It is also welldocumentedthat US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes. That makes these Western states fully complicit. Moscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F-16s bombing of Syrian civilianshttps://t.co/WzwvworaZdpic.twitter.com/cHlKvzaeUD Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years,according toa report last week. Britain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, hassoldover $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015. Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots tohelp trainSaudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law. There is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC. The hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void. Importantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications. The information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources. Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by“activist”groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported “rescue workers” of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. BREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into#Aleppo‘war crimes’https://t.co/xrdojTxO3vpic.twitter.com/2gKhTiMovH In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda.Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called“Free Syria”broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat. Free Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy. It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks. Free Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS. Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans. Another regular contributor to the images and“reports”on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. Thus, on this publicly available“Free Syria”channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam. What is even more damning is that the same “information”is disseminated – albeit in a more polished form – through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian. It’s an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted. Russia’s military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state. That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies. And to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies. The utter insanity of it all. But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception.

"24 Aug, 2016","Modern Ukraine is 25 yrs old, but is it actually independent?","Ukraine celebrates the 25th anniversary of its succession from the Soviet Union this week. But, after years of struggle and division is it truly independent? Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv March 2014 was arguably the most dramatic and pivotal month in Kiev since Ukraine seceded from the USSR. The country’s democratically elected government had been overthrown in a violent coup (considered to be a revolution in the West) and the new regime was struggling for legitimacy. Especially after a leaked phone callbetweenthe US Ambassador Geoff Pyatt, and State Department representative Victoria Nuland, seemed to suggest external actors had dictated its make-up. Adding to the tumult, Crimea had just voted to separate and re-unite with Russia in a hastily organized referendum, (which is regarded as an annexation by much of the West) and Donbass witnessed clashes between pro-Maidan protestors and others who opposed the movement. At this moment, Ukraine was on fire and needed all the support it could muster. Except that backing never came, despite gaggles of Western politicians showing up in Kiev in early 2014 pledging solidarity with activists who sought to remove President Yanukovich. Two and a half years later, Ukraine has received minimal aid from Western countries and is no closer to EU membership than it was then. In fact, even the promised visa-free travel arrangement with Schengen countries has yet to materialize. Sharp analysts have long suggested that Western power brokers aren’t that dedicated to helping Ukraine. Instead, the argument goes, the priority seems to be hurting Russia. This week, via a DC Leaks dump of billionaire Hungarian investor George Soros’ communications; we havenew evidenceto support that argument. What’s also interesting is that when Russia ejected Soros’ NGOs, Western reaction was apoplectic. DC Leaks' revelationssuggestPresident Putin’s move to block these groups might have been soundstrategy.  On the last day of March in 2014, according to the files, Ambassador Pyatt sat down for breakfast with billionaire Soros and a group of lobbyists he employs to push his agenda inEastern Europe. What is most startling about the conversation is the total lack of regard for Ukrainian interests and the obsessive focus on Russia. It’s also instructive as to how Western influencers regard Ukraine. More as a buffer against Moscow than as a country with rightful aspirations of its own. At one stage Pyatt asks Soros,“what (the) USG (US government) should be doing and what the USG is currently doing (sic)?”The reply is“Obama has been too soft on Putin,”and he goes on to suggest“a division of labor between the US and the EU with the US playing the bad cop role”in dealing with the Kremlin. It’s all Putin, Putin, Putin and continues in this vein. The only mention of Ukraine is when Pyatt and Soros agree to remove Yulia Timoshenko from the equation.“Timoshenko is associated with everything undignified,”the ambassador states. Now, we are all entitled to an opinion on Timoshenko. But her political party Fatherland is currently themost popularin Ukraine and it’s up to Ukrainians to decide whether she is fit for office, not a bunch of foreigners who have no democratic mandate in the country. After all, Ukraine is supposed to be a sovereign state. But a quarter of a century after modern Ukraine was established, how independent is it really? If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can’t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous. What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro-western“reformers”and pro-Russian“kleptocrats.”This is hogwash. The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine’s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov). What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power. And for the past two years, they’ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory. Something even America’s influential‘Foreign Policy’journal nowadmits. There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich. But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West. Furthermore, he's enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse-trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal. That said, Poroshenko is described as‘pro-Europe’and his predecessor as‘pro-Russia’. However, in reality, both men are pro-themselves and pro-money. Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success. The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt. Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR’s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems. The central Asians - with the exception of Kazakhstan - have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated. The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova. Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates. They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era. Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago. Let’s just look at Ukraine’s figures. In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller - in real terms - than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off. After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now. To add insult to injury, it is also the world’s mostunequal country. When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling. The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet’s most extensive rail systems. A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world’s largest plane, the An-225. This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons. Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland. Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now. With that in mind, you’d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of ‘Marshall Plan’ to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming. Because they know the funds would be stolen. Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia. As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine“is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States.”Thus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money. For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow. As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine’s economic collapse is the“ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor.” “In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two-thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent. Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal,”Petro recently wrote. However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev.You see, Ukraine doesn’t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia. Except it’s not Slovakia’s gas, because that country doesn’t have any of its own. Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re-sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium. Ukraine's - completely insane - economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs.pic.twitter.com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn’t want to admit that it’s Russian gas. This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers. Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow. To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an“independence day”military parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all. Aside from all this, what Poroshenko's regime can’t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is. Currently, it’s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country. To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world. If Back to the Future’s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again, how many would jump right in?

"18 Aug, 2016",John McCain NGO banned as ‘undesirable group’ in Russia,"Russian prosecutors have recognized the International Republican Institute NGO headed by US Senator John McCain as an undesirable organization, banning the group’s operations in the country and forbidding Russian organizations and citizens from cooperating with it. “After studying the received files [describing the activities of the International Republican Institute], the Prosecutor General’s Office has made the decision to recognize it as an undesirable group on the territory of the Russian Federation,” reads an official statement from prosecutors, released on Thursday. Another US organization, the Media Development Investment Fund, was also recognized as undesirable. Prosecutors added that they had established that the work of the two groups posed a threat to the foundations of Russia’s constitutional order and state security, but gave no further details. The International Republican Institute was founded in 1983 with the declared goal of the promotion of democracy worldwide through helping political parties in foreign countries. Since 1993 the institute has been headed by John McCain – a Republican senator for Arizona known for his numerous anti-Russian initiatives and statements. In early 2015 Russia reportedly included McCain in the list of people subject to personal sanctions, including an entry ban and assets freeze, introduced in response to a similar measures imposed by the United States against Russian officials in 2014. READ MORE: Russia slaps personal sanctions on 200+ foreign citizens – report The Russian Law on Undesirable Foreign Organizations came into force in late May 2015. The act requires the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to make an official list of undesirable foreign groups and outlaw their activities. Once a group is recognized as undesirable, all its assets in Russia must be frozen, its offices closed and the distribution of its information materials banned. If the ban is violated, both the personnel of the outlawed group and any Russian citizens who cooperate with it face heavy fines or even prison terms in the event of repeated or aggravated offenses. About a month after the law came into force, Russia’s upper house released a list of foreign organizations it believed should come under the new restrictions. The list consisted of 12 entries, including such groups as the National Democratic Institute, the US National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Institute also known as the Soros Foundation. READ MORE: Upper house approves first list of 12 ‘undesirable’ foreign groups Several of these groups have already been put on the list of undesirables, including the US National Endowment for Democracy, George Soros’s Open Society Institute and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation, the US-Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (USRF), and the US National Democratic Institute – chaired by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

"25 Jun, 2016",More Brussels bureaucracy: ‘Brexit may take up to 10 years to implement’,"The Tory party will drag its heels to leave the EU, says geopolitical analyst Patrick Henningsen. It has already announced that Brexit is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October, followed by a change of leadership as well, he added. US President Barack Obama, who paid a visit to Britain in April urging the country to stay in the EU, was one of the most vocal leaders against Brexit. The White House says it doesn't welcome the results of the UK referendum, but will accept the choice of the British people. RT:Does the US actually lose out in any way because of Brexit? Patrick Henningsen:They do. If you look back at the history of the European Union, the United States in a sort of covert fashion - initially anyway, post WWII - was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the European Union. And that has been learned through declassified documents and those are now publicly available. It is easier for the US to wield its foreign policy agenda by dealing with one central point of contact, rather than 28 odd different states on any major issue. So, certainly Washington would like to see the EU together and its special relationship with Britain makes that process all the easier when Britain has a major seat in Brussels. RT:The US State Department says John Kerry wants to be part of the talks between London and Brussels. But is the Brexit process really any of Washington's business? PH:That is very interesting if that is the case. The reality right now is that the Tory conservative party is dragging its heels on invoking Article 50, which once it is invoked would set in motion a two-year period of exits and then renegotiating Britain’s terms and conditions of that exit. They have already announced that it is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October and then the change of leadership as well. David Cameron has already hinted this is something for the next conservative leader to do - be that Boris Johnson or Theresa May. So, they’ve already kicked the can down an additional six months. So, we are looking at an exit of a possibly five-year window. Some legal experts say it might be even longer than five years; it could be up to 10 years. We’ll see. Remainers now grasping every piece of economic bad news like shipwrecked mariners reaching for flotsam RT:An EU without Britain would arguably make the Union weaker. So would that actually make Europe more dependent on the US? PH:That is an interesting point. I think from the US point of view, militarily this will be a big issue. NATO has already announced that they stand firm with the current set up and current relationship that includes Britain being at a center of NATO. However, talks of an EU military force, which have been going on behind the scenes for quite long time now, these agreements are already in place between many countries, this system of interdependency between various European militaries. So, it would be very interesting to see how that plays out. Certainly, that is something Washington would like to see in the future - an EU defense force deployed in countries. Also, Washington would like to see Turkey possibly as a member of the EU and that would extend the territory right down to the Middle East. So, from the military point of view, from the Pentagon point of view, from defense contracting profit point of view this could be a fantastic market for arms- and defense-related industries. So, that is one of Washington’s main interests. Plus, being able to wield its foreign policy through Brussels for sanctions against Russia, for instance, is very important for Washington. Thorsten Polleit, economist and investor, Polleit & Riechert Investment Management told RT:“Given the market reaction following the publication of the decision… most investors were caught off guard. Most people wouldn’t have expected the Brits to leave the EU and that explains a lot why stock markets - and particularly the pound - has gone down so substantially. Overtime there will be a reassessment and in particular the prospects for Great Britain are much brighter than what market reaction tells us”. RT:The euro and the pound took big hits. But does that help or hinder the dollar? PH:What we saw is a flight of capital into what they call a perceived safety. People perceive the dollar as a stable haven for investments. So, what you saw – the markets reflected exactly that. You saw money transferred into dollar markets and also into gold, into hard money. So, that’s expected. In terms of the pound – devaluation of the pound at some point is not a bad thing for the British economy. There are a lot of benefits in tourism and also the export benefits as well. Fear mongering before the vote was: “The pound is going to free fall”. George Soros even laid a veiled threat against the Brexit voters. But that is not altogether a bad thing for Britain. And a devalued pound doesn’t hurt its balance of payments at home, paying for domestic services and benefits, which are done domestically anyway. So, I don’t think there are major shock waves there.

"9 Jun, 2016","‘All China’s assets in the US might be annulled‘, warns ex-BoE chief, urging countries to diversify","Washington may be forced to renege on its huge debt to Beijing under catastrophic circumstances, says the former head of the Bank of England Mervyn King. He suggests governments could mitigate risk by diversifying their assets.  “Who knows what the future holds, but China and other countries do not want to be in a situation where all their international assets are in effect dependent on the US,”saidKing, who was the Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013, in an article for Gold Investor magazine. “Of course the US would not want to renege on its debts, but if some awful conflagration occurred, then all China’s assets in the US might be annulled,”said the former BoE chief, adding that China and other countries should diversify their portfolios, making them less dependent“on the goodwill of other countries.” China is the biggest holder of US debt with $1.245 trillion, according to US Treasurydata. Over the past 12 months Beijing has cut its Treasury securities 1.3 percent from $1.261 trillion seen last year. According to the most recent data from March, global central banks sold off $17 billion in US Treasuries. Since the beginning of the year the sell-off has reached $123 billion, which is the quickest pace since 1978.

"8 Jun, 2016",‘West promoting lie of Russian aggression to boost NATO forces in Europe’,"Even in the US many people are looking outside to get more objective information and analysis, Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of the Pan-African News Wire, told RT. The US media is not a free press; it is corporate-controlled, he added. The US Senate held a series of hearings on Tuesday with the aim of information gathering for future policymaking. A number of key domestic issues were supposed to be discussed. However, federal officials seemed to care more about another""headache""for the US, and that's Russian aggression. Addressing Russian""aggression"", US officials went the extra mile to break down the threat of“Russia's mass disinformation”. They even namedropped RT as one of the means of Russian propaganda. RT:Why are US officials and Victoria Nuland in particular so obsessed with Russia? Abayomi Azikiwe:Because stations like RT and other media sources outside of the US are getting hundreds of millions of viewers and readers; even inside the US many people are looking outside to get more objective information and analysis. The US media is not a free press; it is a corporate-controlled media. Even the so-called National Public media in the US – if you look – most of the people who speak in that media come from the corporate sector. They are very concerned about controlling information. It is not unusual that Victoria Nuland would come with a pack of lies. She is quite accustomed to doing that. Remember, this is the same Mrs. Nuland who was... giving away cookies to extremist Ukrainians during the so-called revolt in Ukraine, which had been financed and had been supported by the forces and the money of George Soros and others in order to pull Ukraine away from Russia and create really a pre-war situation in the East... It is not true what Nuland said they have tried for 20 years to get a good relationship with Russia. -William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT RT:US officials continue to talk about so-called Russian aggression... Where is this aggression that Russia poses such a threat to the US AA:They don’t clearly spell it out because the US and NATO have Russia surrounded on many fronts: In Europe, in Eastern Europe. That continuing encirclement is spreading to other parts of the world, including Asia and Africa. They have the US-Africa Command. So, it is the US, the State Department, the CIA, NATO – these are the military alliances that have more bases than any other country throughout the world and they are in fact escalating aggression against Russia and other countries that don’t toe the line of the State Department. RT:Do all these hearings and discussions between American officials on propaganda mean that they are losing this battle? AA:I believe they are. Because particularly among a lot of young people inside the US they are looking for information outside the corporate media. Most of them do not get their news from the major media outlets that are promoted by the corporate interests and by the government. So, they are concerned that you don’t have this type of anti-Russian, anti-Chinese, anti-Iranian type of slant to the media orientation. So, when you have people inside the US that are watching RT, and are watching other stations outside the US, this poses a challenge to their control of information and how people view the world. Mrs. Nuland is one of the real perpetrators of this because she has been in it from the get go. And she is taking a personal responsibility in trying to really destroy Russia as a powerful nation. And that is why there is an obsession here that President Putin has reacted and has reacted strongly because he wants to defend the sovereignty of Russia. And therefore the US and people like Nuland - not the entire US, but some of the leadership - are reacting very strongly to this... ""-William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT. RT:Is it possible to repair ties with another country if you are always claiming them to be a threat to you? AA:It is very difficult to establish any type of fair and just relations when this intense competition is being fostered even on a mass communications level. So, this is something the US State Department has to look at seriously but they are still in all appearances, committed to world hegemony.

"11 May, 2016","‘Trump, Clinton equally right-wing warmongering shields of big business’","Americans have to choose between two equally right-wing pro-war candidates, says Jerome White, presidential candidate for the Socialist Equality Party. He says Trump promotes xenophobic, anti-immigrant lines while Clinton’s a complete tool of Wall Street. A new report by the Wall Street Journalshowsthat US Democratic Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton received millions of dollars for her campaign from Wall Street. RT:Why does Clinton seem to be the preferred candidate for Wall Street? Jerome White:She has a long record, as did her husband Bill Clinton with very, very close connections to the most powerful financial institutions in the US on Wall Street. Under her husband’s administration they deregulated Wall Street; they lifted the Glass–Steagall Act, and allowed the immense building-up of the financial bubble that produced the financial collapse of 2008. As the Obama administration carried out the bailout of Wall Street, the Clintons maintained very, very close ties. As we all know, she received hundreds of thousands of dollars - in fact millions of dollars and speaking fees - in the aftermath of the crash. RT:Clinton is also likely to get more contributions now that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have dropped out of the race. Will this have an impact on her stances on issues and, perhaps, presidency? JW:After an entire primary process in which for the first the anger of millions of workers over the social inequality, over the domination of the entire political system by the financial elites was expressed. In the end essentially, what the American people have is a choice between two equally right-wing candidates, two pro-war candidates. On the one hand, a billionaire, who is Donald Trump, who seeks to tap into the social anxiety and channel it along xenophobic and anti-immigrant lines; on the other, complete tool of Wall Street and of the Pentagon. In the end, the [Bernie] Sanders’ campaign, which tapped into this enormous anger – he is now committed to support Hillary Clinton, who he openly criticizes as a tool of Wall Street. But he as a Democrat now is supporting that very same tool of Wall Street. RT:The fact she is supported by big corporations doesn't seem to be harming Clinton's ratings. Don't people care about this? JW:You have two of the most-hated politicians in the US who are going to be facing off one another in the elections. The fact is that there is deep hatred for Clinton and for Trump. But we live in America, in an entirely bought-and-paid-for political system that excludes any genuine opposition. I am running as the Socialist Equality Party’s candidate for president in the US and the ballot access laws are thoroughly undemocratic. So, as I said, the population - the working class - is confronted with two equally right-wing warmongering shields of big business. RT:Do you have any idea why Clinton makes statements about ""the Wall Street threat"" while she receives huge contributions from America's big bankers? JW:The Democratic Party has long played the role of claiming to be the spokesman of the oppressed, of working people. But it is the second party of finance capital. In this case it is now the primary party of finance capital. So certainly Clinton is going to, as Obama did, present themselves [sic] as being sympathetic to the victims of Wall Street. But in fact if you look at the Obama administration over the last eight years, the greatest transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top has occurred in US history. Whatever the phony rhetoric about Wall Street – none of the criminals from 2008 crash have ever been held accountable. The reports today are that the hedge fund owners have made massive increases even if the industry itself had problems last year, one of the hedge fund recipients, or owners, Ray Dalio made $1.5 billion last year. George Soros, major funder for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, made $700 million last year alone. You have an oligarchy in the US in which is financial elite, which is totally unaccountable, can carry out crimes, dictates policy, dictates domestic policy… That is why they claim as no money for pensions, schools, or decent wages. Yet they can expand trillion of dollars on bailing out the banks and trillions more for war against Russia, or China, or in the Middle East; wars that defend the same financial aristocracy as the war against the working class in the US.

"8 May, 2016",Russia: The new baddie – again,"Each leader the West wants to take down is really the same stock character brought back in slightly different attire after the commercial break; Saddam, Gaddafi and Assad are all the same guy: the archetypal Darth Vader to our Luke Skywalker. Within this simplistic, childlike meta-narrative nothing the baddies do can be good. As those in charge of our propaganda know, the vague, malevolent force which characterizes all our baddies is a much better reason to attack them than anything based in reality. Thus, baddies have no convincing backstory. They are evil because… well, just because. And that is precisely why they must be overcome. While the West had other countries to trash, it let Russia slide in and out of various tenuous sub-plots. But now that Western enemies in the Middle East are burning nicely, the script has space for the development of a new central baddie as the prelude to… Well, we all know what. One struggles to remember a time when Russia could do anything right in the eyes of Western media. It liked the end of the Cold War and the Yeltsin era when Russia was handing over the nation’s wealth to non-Russian interests; a people elbowing each other out of the way in a fight for shiny trinkets – that was acceptable. The pre-story to that drama was the deal Gorbachev cut with the US. Under Gorbachev, the USpromisednot to encroach on Russia’s sphere of influence – a fact now denied by the US, naturally. But at the time it was true, and it gave Russia the confidence it needed to let Communism go and allow personal initiative to find a level. Fast-forward thirty years and NATO is busy fillingPolandwith troops, and claims outrage when Russia monitors its activities in theBaltics. However, when the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to re-join Russia, this result was rejected by Western media as lacking any legitimacy. Russians now get it that in the post-Soviet stage play called 'international politics' anyone with traditional values who doesn’t clap wildly when his own side takes a hit will be hissed at while the piano clangs away menacingly in the corner. They understand that talk about fairness, democracy, choice and equality is just that: talk. They have seen how globalism works. And – unsurprisingly – they aren’t interested in much more of it. In a BBC piece purporting to measure attitudes towards what it calls ‘global citizenship’, Russia isidentifiedas the most backward country on earth. Feeling like a ‘global citizen’ (i.e. having abandoned all the values your grandfather would have laid his life down to uphold) is assumed by the BBC to be the very definition of virtue. Spain is found to be the country most wholeheartedly throwing itself over the cliff-edge, with what the piece calls ‘an eye-catching majority’ of 84 percent believing that they should take in more of those ‘fleeing the five-year civil war’ in Syria. The fallacies are instantly obvious to anyone with a functioning brain: Syria’s ‘civil war’ is entirely the result of sustained attacks by western money and mercenaries, and four out of five ‘refugees’ arenot from Syria. Syria was slated by the US for what it calls ‘regime change’ i.e. unilaterally going into a country which had done it no harm and committing mass murder in order to hand that country over to the same central-banking system which runs everywhere else. The source for this plan was disclosed by none other than General Wesley Clark. But none of that matters. The main thing is that globalism is super fab, and if you don’t want more of it, you’re backward and probably deserve theeconomic warwaged against you because you don’t roll over in the face of NATO - or Soros-backed aggression. Zbigniew Brzeziński – that master of how things actually are rather than how we are told to think about them – famously said:“Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They’ll only be able to parrot the information they’ve been given on the previous night’s news.” He was right. Western publics are nothing if not malleable. Not only is the ability to reason independently largely absent, people also have little or no memory. And their attitudes towards Russia are no exception. Having spent the last few years in Europe, I am constantly impressed by how immune to either facts or reason the general population is. People will say in all seriousness that Putin is behind the current invasion of Europe – repeating theclaimput out there by former NATO chief US General Philip Breedlove, who has been replaced by General Curtis M. Scaparrotti, a man who is busy moving all his pieces into the very spaces on Russia’s border the US promised never to occupy. 'Resurgent Russia': New hardline#NATOEurope commander raises hackles in Moscowhttps://t.co/DDNNywPuPHpic.twitter.com/wrSAxrUwG8 Under Yelstin, Russia was nothing but an economic target; weak and failing, and selling off the family silver for pennies on the dollar while signing wholesale into law legislation handed to it by US NGOs with agendas entirely inimical to those of the Russian people. Yet in the bed-time-story version of events for popular western consumption, Yeltsin was a goodie. Had his successor continued in the same vein – allowing foreign interests to asset-strip the country – the narrative today, doubtless, would be that Russia is ‘free’. I have seen enough of how realpolitik works not to expect anything from any government ever – beyond intrusion into my life and the appropriation of a proportion of what I generate. I regard belief in government per se as a sort of weakness. So while I understand westerners who – rightly disillusioned by their own countries – choose to see Putin as a lone hero fighting a rear-guard action against globalism, I don’t exactly share their sentiments. One can’t help but have a twinge of envy when looking at Russia’s Putin. Firstly, he is both bright and sober. When a journalist asks him a question, he has the ability to answer it well – and often with humor. Even given the hopeless translations into English in the media, at least some of what is in the original Russian comes across. Secondly, he is professional. He demonstrates an appropriate CEO-level grasp on his responsibilities. Thirdly, he describes the world – and acts within it – like a man who regards people in his own country as his principle stakeholders. Whether this is in fact the case is – at least in my opinion – impossible to tell. But it makes for a refreshing and enjoyable narrative. In the West, we are simply not used to this type of presentation. Given the controlled demolition of Europe, it is clear now to those who retain their natural instincts that those who make the big decisions in Europe are simply acting liketraitors. Thus, at the level of narrative, the Western propaganda machine is left with a thorny plot point to resolve. Since relative to Putin the goodies have made themselves look decidedly Darth-Vadery around the gills, the implication is obvious to anyone who knows how stories work: the Force is now with Putin. This is highly problematic; a narrative meltdown. The confusion and dilution of the villain archetype mid-drama – as anyone who has followed Star Wars will know – can mean only one thing: that a brand new, conflict-heavy storyline is on its way. @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"5 May, 2016",'US spending millions on 'Aleppo is burning' PR campaign to create no bombing zone',"The Syrian conflict involves a public relations war with a level of sophistication we’ve never seen before, geopolitical analyst Patrick Henningsen told RT. Russia and the US agreed Wednesday to extend the ceasefire in Syria to Aleppo, the country's second largest city. The Syrian government has accepted the terms of the agreement, with the Syrian Army saying the ceasefire will come into effect on Thursday night and will last for 48 hours. “There has been reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] has a so-called ‘Plan B’ – that if the ceasefire fails, if the Geneva talks fail they will dramatically increase their arms supplies to the moderate opposition. That is obviously not a good incentive. It means some moderate opposition people will say: ‘Why do we have this ceasefire? Why do we have these talks? Because we will get better weapons, if everything breaks down.’”– Guardian columnist Jonathan Steele told RT. RT:How much of an effect could the ceasefire, agreed by Moscow and Washington, have on the situation in Aleppo? Patrick Henningsen:I don’t think it is really going to change the situation on the ground. I think what you have is a situation where extremist groups – call it moderate rebels, or call it terrorist groups – they are going to use the ceasefire to buy time to get reinforcements lined up to establish new supply lines that have been damaged… by Russian airstrikes over the last couple of months. The problem is that Al-Nusra Front, or Ahrar ash-Sham, or all these terrorist groups that are operating freely in Syria in these rebel – held areas – they are ubiquitous with the so-called opposition. You can’t separate them; this is just a game, this is being played. The US knows this quite well. Meanwhile, the diplomats have to play the diplomatic due process. So they are doing their job, but behind the scenes there is whole other agenda playing out. RT:US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently accused Russia of fueling the civil war by supporting Assad. Could such statements make it more difficult for Russia and the US to work together on the peace effort? PH:Firstly, the US Defense Secretary is using language that doesn’t actually apply to this conflict. He is doing this to try to re-frame the narrative. He is calling it a civil war. This is not a civil war by any stretch of the imagination. It ceased being a civil war back in 2011, maybe early 2012, but after that it is anything but a civil war. This is a conflict, it is a proxy war. What you have is the US will do what is called a ‘strategy of confusion’ in terms of public relations. So John Kerry is the good cop, he is there with Sergey Lavrov trying to hammer out a peace deal in Geneva. And Ash Carter is playing the bad cop – he is making inflammatory statements that are trying to characterize Russia as a bad guy. And then President Obama might have another statement that he does, and the State Department spokesman will say something else. This is what the US does constantly; this is their strategy of PR confusion, so that no-one knows exactly where they stand on any of the issues. This is used to basically obscure and cover up what is essentially a dirty war going on the ground in Syria right now. RT:Russia, meanwhile, has said it is not supporting the Assad government. Why would the US object to what Russia is doing? PH:I think it’s out of frustration. Russia came in with a very clear objective back in October, 2015 and they achieved that objective by a lot of people’s estimation. Then they receded their operation, and they packed up and left a large portion of their military footprint there. This upset everybody because the US was saying that Russia was being dragged into a quagmire. At every turn the narratives that are being conjured up by the State Department are getting knocked down and disintegrating. This is just I believe frustration; this is a PR war. We’re looking at a public relations war. The US and George Soros have spent millions of dollars over the last couple of weeks launching ‘Aleppo is burning’ – it is a PR campaign, designed to get people behind a no bombing zone. So the ‘no-fly zone’ became the ‘safe zone’, and now it is a‘no bombing zone’. This is a public relations war with a level of sophistication we’ve never seen before.

"18 Apr, 2016",Top Russian investigator proposes internet censorship using Chinese experience,"The head of Russia’s Central Investigative Committee has urged the country’s officials to step up control of the internet, using China’s experience as a model to counter pressure from the United States. In a major interview with the Kommersant Vlast magazine, Aleksandr Bastrykin said that on March 10 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information introduced a complete ban on electronic mass media completely or partially owned by foreign citizens or companies. Chinese laws also forbid national mass media to cooperate with foreigners without a special permit and only Chinese citizens can hold managerial posts in mass media companies. Besides, Chinese internet media are legally obliged to keep their data on servers located in the country. “I have an understanding that we in Russia could use this experience to a reasonable extent,” Bastrykin told the magazine. READ MORE: Russia should ‘exclude international norms’ from its laws top investigator urges The official said the issue raises many questions and those who promote freedom of access to information may not be in favor. Bastrykin advocated standard norms of data storage for all national internet providers. He said this would help law enforcers investigate crimes more efficiently, including those connected with extremism and terrorism. In September 2015, Russia introduced a law obliging all companies offering internet services to store users’ personal information inside the country. This law also allows the state internet watchdog to blacklist sites that refuse to comply with the new rules and possibly limit access to them. Personal data collected before September 1, 2015 can remain on foreign servers in its unchanged form. Other exceptions include cases described in various international treaties and agreements, such as foreign embassies’ online visa services. READ MORE: Controversial law on personal data storage comes into force Also in 2015, President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill on undesirable foreign organizations. It allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to create a proscribed list of groups whose activities are illegal in Russia. The main criterion for putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is a “threat to the constitutional order and defense capability, or to the security of the Russian state.” Non-compliance with the ban can be punished with administrative penalties. Repeated and aggravated offenses can carry prison sentences of up to six years. Russian citizens and organizations that continue to work with banned groups would face administrative fines only. Since last year, Russian officials have added about a dozen US, Ukrainian and international organizations to this list, including such majors as the Soros Foundation, the National Democratic Institute and the National Endowment for Democracy.

"9 Apr, 2016",Why Sitting Bull was right about Washington’s lack of integrity,"That integrity is a foreign land where Washington is concerned is an inarguable fact. In the latest example, the failure to complete the construction of a nuclear disposal plant agreed with Russia once again leaves Washington’s credibility in tatters. Underlying this issue is the attempt by the US federal government to alter the terms of theagreementit signed with Russia in 2000 for the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium, with each country building industrial plants with this specific objective in mind. Russia has kept its side of the bargain and, at no small cost, built the facility required to dispose of its excess nuclear material in the manner agreed. The US on the other hand is now looking at an alternative method of disposal, which amounts to storing said material in a process that allows it to retain its “breakout potential” – i.e. its ability to be converted back into weapons grade plutonium. ‘Not what we agreed on’: Processing method swap violates US-Russian plutonium dealhttps://t.co/kePBWpIv3qpic.twitter.com/EA3MiCeGWl Given the record of subterfuge and double-dealing on the part of successive US governments when it comes to its failure to honour treaties and agreements, nobody should be surprised. Indeed, this subterfuge is so common where Washington is concerned that you could be forgiven for considering it a quintessentially American trait. Since 2000 alone, the record in this regard makes stark reading. The willfully false assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of WMD, for example, was used as justification for one of the most disastrous wars ever unleashed, certainly in modern times, which only succeeded in plunging Iraq and the wider entire region into a dark night of terrorism and sectarian bloodletting. It is a state of affairs that shows no evidence of abating anytime soon, 13 years later. Following on from that, when Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, he did so as the supposed antidote to the arrogance and mendacity that typified the Bush years before him. One of his very first pledges upon taking office was that he would close of the controversial US prison facility, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, during his first term in office. It was a pledge and an announcement that met with support across the world, given that along with rendition, waterboarding and torture, the very name Guantanamo conjured up his predecessor’s “war on terror,” which replaced international law with might is right as the cornerstone of global affairs. Yet despite Obama’s pledge, 15 years later Guantanamo remains in operation. Behind its bars 37 inmates, denied the right to due process, continue to be held in a state of legal limbo. Compounding the scandal of this US military prison facility is the fact it exists on Cuba’s sovereign territory despite repeated demands by the Cuban government for it to be returned. More recently, we have had the scandal of thePanama Papers, containing evidence of mass and wholesale financial and tax impropriety by leading politicians, corporate executives and the super-rich. However, an even bigger story has been the politicization of the information contained within these papers throughout the Western media, involving a transparent attempt to smear Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, even though neither his name nor the name of any member of his family appears anywhere in them. This is no surprise considering that the misnamed International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), based in Washington, is the body responsible for leaking the information to the media. The ICIJ is the international arm of the US Center for Public Integrity, an organization that counts among its major donors George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and the Carnegie Endowment, among others. This has to explain why out of all the people whose names have been leaked thus far there are conspicuously few American citizens among them. Do they really expect us to believe that the US is immune to financial corruption? Really? Wall Street, the global financial crisis, the land of corporate greed and malfeasance, yet up to now not one major name from the world of politics, business, or banking is included within the Panama Papers? With this in mind, it really doesn’t take a genius to discern the agenda being pursued here. This brings us back to this latest example of US bad faith and lack of integrity when it comes to fulfilling its agreements and international obligations vis-à-vis Russia. By now, Moscow should be accustomed to being lied to by Washington. Whether it is the assurances given to the last Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev that upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union there would be no eastward expansion of NATO, which were not kept, or the manipulation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 to effect regime change in Libya by NATO, time and again the US government, either unilaterally or via Washington-controlled international bodies, has proved that not only its word but its official stamp on treaties and agreements is meaningless. In this regard, the words of none other than Sitting Bull have proved eerily prescient over the generations since the great Indian warrior-chief uttered them. ""There are things they tell us that sound good to hear, but when they have accomplished their purpose they will go home and will not try to fulfill our agreements with them."" Sitting Bull’s analysis of Washington and its integrity has stood the test of time.

"8 Apr, 2016","Panama dilemma: Washington doesn’t know if leak was ‘theft,’ but approves of ‘independent journos’","US officials, always sensitive to anti-American leaks and harsh to whistleblowers, now appear unconcerned about how the Panama Papers came to light. Grilled by reporters, the State Department could not tell if the US-funded leak was actually data theft or not. US State Department spokesperson Mark Toner on Thursday appeared to be seriously confused as to what stance to take in respect of the Panama leaks, with the investigative reporting group that released them partially funded by the American government via the USAID agency. When AP reporter Matt Lee asked if the US government sees the documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) as stolen, Toner dodged the question, saying it was for the“Panamanian legal system or legal process to decide on.” Toner was then asked a seemingly simple yes-or-no question:“If someone comes across hundreds of thousands of pages of confidential documents and publishes them, and they were clearly not meant to be seen by the public, you don’t think that that’s theft?” The spokesperson wasn’t also able to produce a coherent reply, saying that he“can’t speak at this time…whether this was theft or not.” #CurseDavidCamerontrends as PM admits to profiting from Panama fundhttps://t.co/U6iOPd7JNIpic.twitter.com/wjtPuuF404 Lee also reminded Toner of the hard stance the US government has taken towards Chelsea Manning, who was accused“of aiding the enemy”and given 35 years behind bars under the Espionage Act. He also pointed to the case of Edward Snowden, whom Washington has demanded to be extradited for prosecution over the biggest US intelligence leak in history. WikiLeaks has accused the US government of being partly involved in the Panama Papers release as through USAID it funded the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), one of the groups that produced the leak. The whistleblowing website noted the fact that the OCCRP“targets Russia & [the] former USSR,”and that it turns out that Washington and George Soros paid the group to target Russia and President Vladimir Putin. The Obama administration has been cautious in its reaction to the massive leak of documents, which exposed the tax haven and dozens of influential players involved. Overall, it appears that Washington has welcomed the report as a good deed which, in the State Department’s words,“can shine a light on corruption.” Having distanced the US from the leak, Toner would not deny America’s funding for the OCCRP. Panama Papers: 'Biggest leak in history' on corruptionhttps://t.co/jpM8MJdG8zpic.twitter.com/fCNQF2dPN9  “It’s part of our – a core tenet of our foreign policy that we support organizations that go after corruption,”he said at the briefing. “Obviously, these are the kind of organizations that USAID has and continues to fund,”Toner said, adding that the US is not seeking to go after anyone in particular. While the State Department calls the leak“independent journalism,”the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, which lost hold of 11.5 million sensitive documents, has labeled it “a hack.” In the low-tech world a hack, or an unlawful seizure of data, simply means a theft – something not so apparent to Washington. There is still much secrecy surrounding the Panama Papers, Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent and whistleblower, told RT. She compared the leaks made by the NSA whistleblower Snowden, which were “completely transparent,” to the“secret”Panama Papers. “In this case the greatest secrecy right now is that no one knows who the leaker could be, no one knows his identity,”she said. Rowley added that she hopes that the reporters who leaked the information“would fairly apply the standards … and will reveal more information about different powerful public figures from around the world.” “Secrecy is always pernicious. And it is pernicious whether it’s a …criminal carrying on his activities or whether it’s a powerful institution or even a government.” Rowley believes that the ideal solution would be“to lower the level of secrecy [about the Panama Papers] and regulate these shell companies and tax havens.” “The hypocrisy is that the US is one of the easiest places to create havens to hide taxes,”she stressed.

"7 Apr, 2016",‘Panama Papers’ turn up names of rogue US execs,"Documents dubbed the ‘Panama Papers’ have revealed the names of over 200 US residents who used the services of Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca. Among them are several businessmen charged with financial crimes, or already convicted of wrongdoing. Some of the names on the list appear to be retired Americans seeking to buy real estate in Panama and Costa Rica, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the US-based group that is publishing revelations from the documents obtained by an anonymous hacker in 2015. Initial revelations by ICIJ have sought to implicate celebrities and politicians across the world. It has since emerged that Mossack Fonseca had registered over 1,000 businesses in the US – primarily in Nevada and Wyoming – and that it had many US clients in Panama as well. READ MORE: 'Panama Papers’ company set up 1000+ businesses in USA Among the company’s US clients listed in the documents are four businessmen who have been convicted of financial crimes, as well as one who is currently facing serious charges. Their identities were first made public by McClatchy Newspapers. Robert Miracle of Washington was sentenced in 2011 to 13 years in prison for mail fraud and tax evasion, over his role in a $65 million Ponzi scheme involving an oil field in Indonesia. In 2008, John Michael “Red” Crim of Pennsylvania was convicted to eight years in prison, for involvement in a plot to cheat the US tax authorities of $10 million in revenue using fraudulent trusts. The same year, Jonathan Kaplan of Massachusetts received a 5-year probation sentence for accepting a bribe from a client of his prepaid telephone card business. In 2007, California real-estate mogul Igor Olenicoff was sentenced to two years of probation and a $52 million fine, for tax evasion and use of offshore shell companies. Wall Street financier Benjamin Wey was indicted in September 2015, on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. The government claims he used family members to secretly gain control of large blocks of stock in companies through“reverse mergers”between Chinese corporations and US shell companies – incorporated by Mossack Fonseca, according to McClatchy. Wey’s indictment says he accumulated tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits by manipulating the companies’ stock prices. Announcing the indictment, US Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York called Wey a“master of manipulation.”Wey, president of the New York Global Group,told USA Todaythere was no evidence he’d ever owned or controlled a foreign account. The leaked documents have been of great interest to the US government, which said it would use them in prosecuting financial crimes as well as upholding the sanctions regime against countries such as Russia. “The US government intently focuses on investigating possible illicit activity, including violations of US tax laws or sanctions, using all sources of information, both public and non-public,”the Department of Treasurytold Bloomberg Newsin an emailed statement. Ernst Wolff, a journalist and author of ‘Pillaging the World: The History and Politics of the IMF,’ says the US is using the scandal to cause upheaval around the world and redirect the flow of money into tax havens in America. “Of course, they have to put in some American individuals and some American companies in order to kind of camouflage the whole thing,”Wolfftold RT.“But those are only minor people in there. The big people in there are non-American citizens: they are Europeans; they are people from different countries all over the world.” “This is this anti-Russian, anti-China, anti-Iran campaign that just keeps beating in America,”Gerald Celente, publisher of the Trends Journal, told RT.“I believe that this might be a push back from Soros for Russia last year banning a number of American NGOs. So, this could be payback.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more.

"7 Apr, 2016",‘US pretends fighting tax havens while creating its own’,"The United States have been professing to be fighting tax evasion all over the world, but at the same time, it’s opened up tax havens at home: in Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming and South Dakota, says journalist Ernst Wolff. READ MORE: ‘Who’s funding this?’ CIA & MI5 whistleblowers question credibility of Panama Papers coverage RT:Why would people move their offshore money to a relatively high-tax regime in the United States rather than say Ireland or Luxembourg? Ernst Wolff:The United States has been professing to be fighting tax evasion all over the world, but at the same time, they've opened up some tax havens in their own country. See, the states ofDelaware, Nevada, Wyoming and South Dakota are the new Switzerlands of this world. They are absolute tax havens that guarantee people banking secrecy which surpasses that of Switzerland and Luxembourg. The Americans have professed to be fighting against tax evasion but actually they've opened up their accounts to foreign money. What they are doing right now is they are blackmailing people all over the world because nobody knows if he will end up in that list. And the only way people can avoid ending up in that list is putting their money into the new tax havens in America. RT:Why do you think the 'Panama Papers' leak contains little about American business or individuals? EW:Of course, they have to put in some American individuals and some American companies in order to kind of camouflage the whole thing. But those are only minor people in there. The big people in there are non-American citizens: they are Europeans; they are people from different countries all over the world. And the most important thing is the things that are not reported because they are holding back a lot of information. So that way they can blackmail people all over the world who will be afraid that their name might show up there some time. RT:Reaction’s been varied from the names dragged into this scandal. Iceland's PM's offered to quit, Ukraine's president says his actions are 'normal'. Do you expect any other repercussions in the coming days? EW:I do. The whole thing should be seen in the wider context. Because what is the American government doing? It's pursuing a policy of destabilization all over the world, and this also serves this purpose of destabilization. They are causing a lot of upheaval all over the world and also they are causing a lot of money to find its way into the tax havens in America. The US is preparing for a big, super-big financial crisis, and they want all that money in their own vaults and not the vaults of other countries. Gerald Celente, publisher of the Trends Journal, told RT:“When the Panama Papers were first reported in the US, the first thing that they started writing about were the connections between those who alleged to put the money in the offshore accounts and Putin without any evidence at all…This is this anti-Russian, anti-China, anti-Iran campaign that just keeps beating in America.” US government, Soros funded#panamapapersto attack Putin – WikiLeakshttps://t.co/Puecb6mnCrpic.twitter.com/o1i0f9T2hO Commenting on billionaire George Soros’s connection to this issue Celente said:“As a matter of fact, his influence is beyond global – look what’s going on in America and his influence in the presidential reality show that they call a presidential race. And when you read from the Guardian that “much of the leaked material will remain private”…this is supposed to be a free and open society? I believe that this might be a push back from Soros for Russia last year banning a number of American NGOs. So, this could be payback.” Given the political class in Washington, it is very unlikely any serious attempt will be made to reform the US financial system with regard to laundering and tax havens, says political commentator and writerJohn Wight.

"6 Apr, 2016",'Panama Papers’ company set up 1000+ businesses in USA,"Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian company at the heart of the leaked documents scandal, has set up over 1,000 businesses inside the US since 2001, highlighting the emergence of the US as an international tax haven. Dubbed the“Panama Papers,”the leaked papers have pointed to several former and current government leaders across the world. Iceland’s Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson was pressured to resign over his role in the scandal, while the offshore fund run by the late father of UK Prime Minister David Cameron has been named as a client as well. However, Mossack Fonseca has also operated in the United States, registering almost 1,100 businesses over the past 15 years. Its Nevada operation, whichUSA Today describesas“a one-employee company based out of a low-slung tile-roofed office building 20 miles from the Las Vegas strip,”is responsible for 1,026 registrations. Another business registration operation was set up in Wyoming the same year. The Wyoming office is actually operated from Las Vegas, according to a testimony given in a Nevada court case in 2014 by Mossack Fonseca’s Patricia Amunategui, USA Todayreported. Panama Papers: 'Biggest leak in history' on corruptionhttps://t.co/jpM8MJdG8zpic.twitter.com/fCNQF2dPN9 Among the corporations created by the Nevada subsidiary of Mossack Fonseca are 123 firms named in the corruption probe involving the current and former presidents of Argentina, and another entity implicated in the corruption scandal within FIFA, the international soccer association, according to USA Today. On Monday, as the“Panama Papers”revelations captivated the headlines, US President Barack Obama announced new rules aimed to prevent US corporations from using legal tricks such as“inversion”to avoid taxes. The move is yet another step in the ongoing US crackdown on offshore tax havens, launched with the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The law requires financial firms to disclose accounts held by US citizens and report them to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or face penalties. Yet when the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) sought to apply FATCA standards internationally, the US was among the handful of countries that refused to sign on – along with Bahrain, and the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Vanuatu, according to aBloomberg reportfrom January. In fact, as Washington has blasted foreign tax havens, many transnational financial organizations have been setting up shop in the US, using the low taxes and confidentiality provisions in state laws in places like Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota and Delaware. Calling those states""the new Switzerlands of this world,""journalist and author Ernst Wolff told RT,""The United States have been professing to be fighting tax evasion all over the world, but at the same time, they've opened up some tax havens in their own country."" ""What's the American government doing? It's pursuing a policy of destablization all over the world, and this also serves the purpose of destabilization,""Wolff added.""The US is preparing for a big, super-big financial crisis, and they want all that money in their own vaults and not the vaults of other countries."" Andrew Penney, managing director at the Rothschild Wealth Management & Trust, even went so far as to describe the US as“effectively the biggest tax haven in the world,”according to Bloomberg – though he ultimately decided to omit that description from a presentation given to clients in San Francisco, California last September. Mossack Fonseca’smarketing materialshave pointed out that Wyoming has no state taxes, low corporate taxes, and“robust protections for the assets of management and investors.”Likewise, limited liability companies“may be formed with a single member which can help avoid US federal income tax reporting requirements,”while ownership is“confidential and under state law may only be obtained by court order.” The“Panama Papers”were initially leaked to the German newspaperSüddeutsche Zeitung(SZ) a year ago by an unknown hacker. The paper then forwarded them to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ is“funded and organized entirely by the USA’s Center for Public Integrity,”former UK diplomatCraig Murray pointed out, noting that the CPI is backed by the US government’s international development agency (USAID), and foundations such as George Soros’s Open Society Fund, the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Family Fund. While the ICIJ hasdenied targeting Russia, much of the coverage of the “Panama Papers” in the US and the UK has focused on Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose name does not appear anywhere in the documents.

Claims that#PanamaPapersthemselves are a 'plot' against Russia are nonsense.

Earlier this week, the head of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which worked on the Panama Papers, said that Putin is not the target of the leak, but rather that the revelations aimed to shed light on murky offshore practices internationally. ""It wasn’t a story about Russia. It was a story about the offshore world,"" ICIJ head Gerard Ryle told TASS. His statement came in stark contrast to international media coverage of the ""largest leak in offshore history."" Although neither Vladimir Putin nor any members of his family are directly mentioned in the papers, many mainstream media outlets chose the Russian president’s photo when breaking the story. READ MORE: Panama leak reveals more about Western journalism than Vladimir Putin “We have innuendo, we have a complete lack of standards on the part of the western media, and the major mistake made by the leaker was to give these documents to the corporate media,” former CIA officer Ray McGovern told RT. “This would be humorous if it weren’t so serious,” he added. ""The degree of Putinophobia has reached a point where to speak well about Russia, or about some of its actions and successes, is impossible. One needs to speak [about Russia] in negative terms, the more the better, and when there's nothing to say, you need to make things up,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, commenting on anti-Russian sentiment triggered by the publications.

He said withholding of the documents could hardly be viewed as ""responsible journalism."" #PanamaPapers: If you censor more than 99% of the documents you are engaged in 1% journalism by definition.

"6 Apr, 2016",The #PanamaPapers: If it was a US/Soros-backed plot it backfired badly,"If ‘Get Putin’ really was the agenda behind the data leaks as some believe, then the plan seems to have backfired as it is US ally David Cameron who is currently feeling the most heat from the revelations. is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger.

He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Suspicions that this was a ‘hit job’ on an ‘official enemy’ of the US stem from the timing of the Panama Papers release - just one week after Russia helped the Syrian Army liberate Palymra from ISIS, thus pushing back US plans for regime change in Syria still further - and that the documents had been shared with two particular organizations, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)which receives funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institutes - and in the case of the former, USAID. #PanamaPapersPutin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia & former USSR and was funded by USAID & Soros.pic.twitter.com/tgeKfLuROn Soros, the world‘s 16th richest man, is a well-known enemy of the Russian government (at Davos this year he made his usualattackson Russia and its policies) and any ‘leaks’ and allegations that would show Putin in a bad light would of course further his agenda. The lack of prominent US individuals among the 11 million released documents has also raised a few eyebrows. suspicions understandable when no US officials & corporate media gatekeeping the leakshttps://t.co/pyNLoUyOyR But if we are indeed talking about a US/ Sorosian conspiracy to foment trouble in Russia in a parliamentary election year, then it’s a plan which seems to owe more to Baldrick than Albert Einstein. While ‘official enemies’ Putin and Assad duly made the headlines on day one of the news leak, the story has now moved on and threatens to jeopardize the careers of individuals Washington surely wouldn’t want to see affected. Furthermore, the leaks also put into the spotlight the turbo-globalist, elite-friendly economic system designed not in Russia, but by self-styled ‘free marketers’ in the US and Britain in the 1970s. A Pandora’s Box has been opened by the Panama leaks and - ironically given the ICIJ and the OCCRP’s funding – it’s billionaire global capitalists like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash. Here’s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we’ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super-rich as elite-friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II. In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005. Last October, Oxfamrevealedthat half the world’s wealth was in the hands of just one percent of the population. The Panama leaks, described by whistleblower Edward Snowden as“the biggest leak in the history of data journalism,”show us how the global super-rich exploit the current system still further to keep their wealth away from the taxman - and get even richer at our expense. And what the revelations make clear is that the super-rich wouldn’t be able to do this without the help of banks, lawyers, accountants and other intermediaries who most clearly do not act in the public interest. British neocons and Sorosian ‘liberals’ who no doubt gloated over Monday’s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don’t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes out smelling of roses, it’s Washington’s most obedient ally- Britain - and its political and financial elites that arguably comes out of this scandal worst of all. 'The UK harbours the largest tax avoidance havens in the world'https://t.co/HU1bD32K7R#PanamaPaperspic.twitter.com/1NS6V5Zr9j The more we read about the leaks, the more we understand thekey roleof the City of London, British overseas territories and Crown Dependencies in the global tax avoidance system. After Hong Kong (which don‘t forget was a British Dependent Territory until 1997), UK firms figure more than the firms of any other countries in the Panama Papers. All in all, 1,900 British firms feature, and more than half of the 300,000 firms believed to have used the services of Mossack-Fonesca are registered in British overseas territories or Crown dependencies. The role of British banks, such as HSBC, Rothschild and Coutts in helping the rich stash their gains away intax-havenshas also been highlighted. Roll call of top Tory tycoons exposed in#PanamaLeakshttps://t.co/uEZJvpSocEpic.twitter.com/RgV1oJejOR Indeed, the Panama scandal goes right to the heart of the British establishment as top Tory donors have been named in the leaked Papers. But it’s therevelationsabout the late father of the current Prime Minister which could do most damage to Cameron and his government. Ian Cameron, a multi-millionaire stockbroker, was the director of an investment fund called Blairmore, which was incorporated in Panama and run from The Bahamas. The fund, which helped the super-rich shield investments from UK tax, has never paid a penny of tax in over thirty years. Cameron has been accused of failing to give a ‘clear and full account’ about his links to the fund set up by his father. At first Number 10 said that Cameron’s tax affairs were a“private matter”. Then on Tuesday a new statement""To be clear, the prime minister, his wife and their children do not benefit from any offshore funds. The prime minister owns no shares.” On Wednesday though- a slightly different story emerged. We weretoldthat there were“no offshore trusts or funds”that Cameron or his near family would benefit from“in future”’. What makes all this harder to take are the policies of austerity pushed on the British people by Cameron and his party. The lives ruined by Cameron's govt demands justice re the crooked money used to give him the life of privilege he's enjoyed.#panamapapers Only a week or so ago, it was revealed that over 300 public libraries had been forced to close in England and Wales since 2010 because of spending cuts. These cuts- we‘re told- are made to help reduce the government deficit, but imagine how healthy the public finances would be if instead of tax-dodging and helping others to tax-dodge, multi-millionaires like the Prime Minister’s father had paid their proper contribution? As opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn correctly stated:“This is money that’s taken from our health service, our local services.” At a time of plenty, tax-dodging by the super-rich might lead to a shrug of the shoulders, but at a time of cuts which are havingdisastrous consequenceson individuals and communities,it’s enough to turn the mildest, most politically moderate person into a pitchfork-carrying revolutionary. One name you know you'll never find in the#PanamaPapers: Jeremy Bernard Corbyn#OurCorbynpic.twitter.com/VLlxuK4pui In Britain the #PanamaPapers revelations are likely to provide a boost for Jeremy Corbyn ahead of important local elections next month. And in America, Bernie Sanders could be the beneficiary. An article in Wednesday’s Independent newspaper in Britainarguesthat “The Panama Papers could hand Bernie Sanders the White House.” “Nobody is going to be under more pressure than Hillary Clinton,”argues Matthew Turner.“For some Americans, she is the embodiment of a 'global elite;' while Bernie Sanders is its antithesis… The huge leak exposes governments across the globe willfully ignoring tax avoidance by the rich. Although Clinton has not been linked to any malfeasance in the leak, there is a sense that she is among the elite rich, some of whose members have benefited from such schemes.” Well, if the #PanamaPapers do help Bernie to the White House - and indeed Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 in Britain - we can only imagine what George Soros’s reaction would be. After all this is a man who hasdonated$7m to a Hillary Clinton super PAC. For all his progressive talk, the very last thing the ‘liberal’ George Soros would like to see is a return of socialistic economies in the West and across the world. He has after all spent decades helping to topple and destabilize governments which put their people before the interests of predatory global capitalists and hedge funders like himself. Is his anti-Putin obsession so great he’d risk bringing the whole system down with him? The Panama Leaks may or may not have been part of a conspiracy against Russia (and its worth pointing out that the ICIJ head Gerard Ryle hasdeniedthis is the case, but one thing is for sure: their consequences are going to be felt across the world and not just in Iceland, where public protests have already led to thestepping asideof Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsonn- after his links to an offshore company were revealed. Icelandic PM quits. British PM?#PanamaLeakspic.twitter.com/plTheTe7Um Let’s return to Pandora. After she had closed her box, one thing was left: Hope- and that's what we've got going for us today. Hope that we can change a system which benefits the global super-rich at the expense of everyone else. If the #PanamaPapers do in time lead to a much fairer and more transparent global economic system, in which tax havens are closed and the 1 percent’s wealth is used to benefit the Common Weal, then it really will be three cheers for those who are releasing the documents - whoever it is who funds them and whatever agenda they might have had at the start. Though I doubt David Cameron, right at this moment, feels the same way.

"24 Mar, 2016",America faces its moment of Trump,"The meteoric rise of Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner who is giving the Establishment 3D nightmares, is the natural outcome of a political system that has been arrogantly ignoring the will of the American electorate for many years. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge What started off as cheap comic fodder for late night television, and later ignored by the elite as an unfortunate yet containable nuisance, has now exploded on the scene as a destructive force of nature capable of blowing away the Establishment’s corporate-owned power structure. Yes, we are talking about The Donald, a Category-5 political hurricane that is expected to cause major devastation should it touchdown in the Beltway. So anxious are the Democrats (and Republicans!) to contain the mighty Trump they will even deny his First Amendment right to address his supporters. Yes, while many Americans travel great distances at their own expense to listen to Trump’s white-hot political message, perennial provocateur George Soros must pay his puppets to erect roadblocks and hoist placards to deny free passage to the venues. Who says ‘freedom-loving,’ liberal activists lack a sense of irony? Trump on Putin’s compliment: ‘Great honor’https://t.co/WPsiSWKYQApic.twitter.com/2WmfxnGvsn Last week, for example, demonstrations in Chicago organized by the Soros-funded MoveOn.org group forced Trump to cancel a speaking engagement. Later, on March 20, members of the same subversive outfitblocked trafficnear a Trump event in Arizona, while police in New York City the same day pepper-sprayed demonstrators, some of whom are affiliated with violent anarchist groups. And then there’s the corporate-owned media, which, instead of impartially and dispassionately reporting on Trump’s rising star, is working on behalf of its owners to knock it out of the sky. Here is a random CNN smearpiece, which opens with the angst-ridden line:“Anti-Trump Republicans desperate to stop the billionaire from being their nominee are discussing creative ways to halt his momentum.”So the story now is not about the millions of Americans who support Trump's political ideas, nor even discussing what those ideas might be, but rather about how the""racist, misogynist, sexist""outsider must be stopped. Consider these two competing lines from another CNNarticle, and how they work to manipulate the mind of the reader regarding the“boastful”Trump and the“proud”Clinton: “Trump repeatedly boasts about the failure of millions of dollars in attack aids to wound his campaign, and insists he is on pace to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination.” While the very next about Clinton reads: “Clinton said she was ""very proud"" to have won Arizona and hit Republican candidates who she said were ‘literally inciting bigotry and violence.’” But it is not just the Democrats and the liberal media working to sabotage Trump’s campaign. Incredibly, even the Republican Party is""plotting against their own frontrunner,""as Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox Newsexplained. But why would the GOP work against Trump if he represents the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? #HillaryClintonspeaks at#AIPAC2016conference [VIDEO]https://t.co/X1yGaBHOvM Pirro nails it with this answer to herself:“The Republican establishment… are in bed with the Democrats. So if Hillary wins, nothing is lost for them. It’s business as usual. The lobbyists keep their offices on K Street, the pharmaceutical companies keep paying them… and the lawmakers get their re-election bribes - I mean, contributions.” Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, when asked to explain the elite’s refusal to support Trump, perhaps gave away a bit too much information when hesaid:“Well, because he’s an outsider, he’s not them, he’s not part of the club, he’s uncontrollable, he hasn’t been through the initiation rites, he didn’t belong to the secret society.” Initiation rites? Secret societies? Secret handshakes? Did Newt just join ranks with the conspiracy theorists? Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump’s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he’s worth $8.7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4.1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra-wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers. One of his regular claims - aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border – is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico. Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America’s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him. Although it is a delicious sight watching America's movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump’s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold-hearted wretchedness of the dual-party, borderline-fascist system. Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega-wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks. The Establishment would continue unmolested with its'too-big-to-jail'banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power. Trump's ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized. Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they'd work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors. Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril. This polarizing issue largely explains Trump's huge popularity among voters today. The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country – and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) – may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment’s back. In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump's political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it. Amazing comments from the Pope- considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls.pic.twitter.com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor. But let’s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens. Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don’t need any help from illegal aliens, thank-you-very-much. Now before somebody screams ‘Hitler!’ in this political theater of the absurd, let’s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good-paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff-raff. According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year. So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US-Mexican border. But the crazy is just beginning. Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don’t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance. FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing. Only the government could script such a narrative. But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag-saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings. “The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you,”said Garza.“This right here is border insecurity at its best. Our border is not patrolled… our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities.” If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right-wing parties, I really can’t imagine it. And since the entire notion of ‘strong national borders’ has somehow morphed into political-correct-speak for ‘racism’, these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from. No, sending a message to other would-be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago. Trump’spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico. After all, America’s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the ‘hope and change’ that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors. Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama’s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W. Bush’s reckless 8-year ‘war on terror.’ “Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze. Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it. ""He never explained that decision to the public…” A bit later, Weston wrote:“Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn’t seem to be. All Americans knew... is that they’re still unemployed, they’re still worried about how they’re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can’t get a job.” Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump. Aside from his inspiring message of securing America’s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America’s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies. Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non-consequential 8-year intermission by America’s first black president). Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex-president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree). “I think this is a . . . great country and if we can’t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that’s silly,”she told C-Span early last year.“I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes – there are just more families than that.” But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to ‘dump Trump,’ the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber. There’s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America's former shine. @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US.

"11 Mar, 2016",Prosecutors brand Madeleine Albright’s NGO as undesirable in Russia,"The Prosecutor General’s Office has ruled that the National Democratic Institute, chaired by a former US secretary of state, poses a threat to Russian security and constitutional order. It proposed including the NGO on the list of undesirable organizations. The proposal to blacklist Madeleine Albright’s NDI group has been forwarded to the Justice Ministry, but as everything that is left is pure formalities the ban can be considered as already imposed. According to NDI’s website the group operated in Russia directly since late 1980s. In 2012 it closed its office in the country, but continued to implement its programs through partner organizations. READ MORE: Foreign Ministry praises law banning undesirable foreign groups in Russia Russia introduced the Law on Undesirable Foreign Organizations in late May 2015. The act requires the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to make an official list of undesirable foreign groups and outlaw their activities. Once the group is recognized as undesirable, all its assets in Russia must be frozen, offices closed and distribution of any of its information materials must be banned. If the ban is violated, both the personnel of the outlawed group and Russian citizens who cooperate with them face punishments of heavy fines, or even prison terms in case of repeated or aggravated offence. About a month after the law came into force, Russia’s upper house released a list of foreign organizations it plans to declare undesirable. The list consisted of 12 entries, including such groups as the National Democratic Institute, the US National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Institute also known as the Soros Foundation. READ MORE: Communists want Soros Foundation branded ‘undesirable’ group In late July, the Justice Ministry fulfilled the prosecutors’ request to officially list the US National Endowment for Democracy as an undesirable group after law enforcers had discovered that the US NGO had spent millions on attempts to question the legitimacy of Russian elections and tarnish the prestige of national military service. In December last year, the Justice Ministry added George Soros’s Open Society Institute and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation as undesirable groups. Also in December the US-Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (USRF) was added to the list. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"5 Mar, 2016","I'm confused, can anyone help me? Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I'm confused. Very confused. Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I’m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately'weaponizing’the migration/refugee crisis to ‘overwhelm European structures and break European resolve'. According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe. How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute. I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives. If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here’s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia’s intervention in Syria-on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011. Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011- so surely it’s more accurate to accuse them of ‘weaponising’ the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded. Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return.""Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government. We want people to come back to Syria,""hesaidin February. Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria. ""I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back,""he said, asreportedby Telesur. And this is the man who - along with Putin- we are told is deliberately ‘weaponising’ migration by the NATO commander? I’m confused. Can anyone help me? I’m also confused - very confused in fact- by the portrayal of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as a 'progressive' who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be 'the lesser of two evils'. Now, from what I‘ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and ‘regime changer' whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place. Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton’s foreign policy record in this 2015article. Among Hillary’s boasts are that she ‘urged’ her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia. The innocent civilians killed in the illegal 'humanitarian’ bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton‘urged’included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy - an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces. Four years later, Hillary sided with hard-right Republican Party hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq. Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa. But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS. You don’t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny. ""We came. We saw. He died!"" Last week on George Galloway’s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party’s Dr Jill Stein told us ‘Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn’t support’. How does Clinton’s record make her 'progressive'? Or has the word ‘progressive’ today been redefined to mean ‘an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge-fund billionaire GeorgeSoros. I’m confused. Can anyone help me?. The EU referendum. Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo. But I’m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for ‘Brexit’ in June’s Referendum. We'retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for ’national security’ and in order todealwith ‘Russian aggression’. ""Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn't support""@DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic.twitter.com/evltbtGyuo We’re told a ‘Brexit’ would‘shock’the world economy. And the UK itself wouldbreak up.But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn't in the EEC/EU. And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well. In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of £550m. As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: ‘The public finances were also in rude health - a borrowing requirement of £1.96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of £600m by the end of 1969. And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969.’ Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre-EEC accession era, but the UK wasn’t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don’t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children‘s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv). So our national security clearly didn’t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU. Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it’s a different world today. But Norway and Switzerland aren't in the EU and didn’t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited. Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation. The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people. Leading bankers. City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders. Tony Blair. They can’t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn’t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I’m confused. Can anyone help me? I’m confused- still confused- about the ongoing investigation into the MH-17 plane disaster. After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong ‘evidence’ that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air- missile. “We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot-down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft,""said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014. But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data. Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they’d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators. Now if it was so clear cut that ‘rebels’ supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago. I’m confused. Can anyone help me? I’m also confused about what we’ve been told by western political figures about Russia’s intervention in Syria. When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn’t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and 'moderate Syria opposition forces’. ""You have a strong propaganda message that says you’re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it,”UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October. But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a‘warning shot’for Russia. But if Russia hadn’t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we've seen renewed allegations that Russia isn’t hitting IS. But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia’s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals. ‘Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January:""It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad’s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary. This is no longer the case."" How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS’s‘air force'. Surely IS would be advancing if Russia’s campaign was really aiding the group? I’m confused. Can anyone help me? Finally I’m confused about Turkey and British support for ‘democratic values’. British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a ‘long-standing goal for Britain. His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons. When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an""important ally"". Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper. A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court. ""By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan’s government is steamrolling over human rights,”says Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International. Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid:""The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated... Impunity for human rights abuses persisted. The independence of the judiciary was further eroded."" Now, neocons always tell us that they’re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy- so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes. So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond? Instead of condemning Turkey’s undemocratic crackdowns, Hammond tweets about extending sanctions on Russia. Agreed at#AmiensFGBon need to keep EU sanctions against Russia until full#Minskagreement implementation#Ukrainepic.twitter.com/RqAooF4UPV The accessioncriteriafor membership of the EU includes:""stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities."" Why are neocons so keen on Turkey joining the EU when its clear that these conditions are not met?I’m confused. Can anyone help me?

"4 Mar, 2016","EU’s refusal to accept Ukraine exposes Kiev’s deceit of its own people, says Russian MP","The Ukrainian people remain hostage to the deceitful Kiev regime, but no one is ready to welcome them into Europe, the head of the State Duma’s Committee for Security and Countering Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, has told reporters. The comments came soon after the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said in a speech in The Hague that he does not expect Ukraine to join the European Union or NATO in the nearest 20 or even 25 years. “Ukraine will definitely not be able to become a member of the EU in the next 20-25 years, and not of NATO either,” Juncker said, as quoted by German news agency DPA. Yarovaya gave her comments on the matter to RIA Novosti: “The EU and NATO do not value the sacrifice of the Ukrainian elite. The deceived and dispossessed Ukrainian people remain hostages of the mad and cynical instigators of Maidan,” she said. “Euromaidan activists have already packed their bags, but it turned out that they still have nowhere to go – no one expects them anywhere,” Yarovaya added, using the ‘Euromaidan’ term coined by mass media two years ago to describe the protests against the cancelation of Ukraine’s association agreement with the European Union. The discontent eventually resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovich, and led to the establishment of the current Kiev regime. READ MORE: Ukraine-EU agreement a ‘George Soros road to nowhere’ - Keiser The association agreement went into force provisionally on January 1 this year, but it still requires support from all 28 members of the European Union. A public opinion poll conducted by the Russian state-owned agency VTSIOM in late February this year showed that many Russians now see the Ukrainian political crisis as “anarchy and banditry” caused by the policies of the Kiev authorities and provoked from Washington. When researchers asked the respondents to describe the Maidan events, 34 percent said they saw them as “anarchy and banditry,” 18 percent called them a “coup d’état” and 12 percent said that the events can be described as “civil war.” READ MORE: Ukraine turmoil triggered by US provocations, majority of Russians maintain When asked about their ideas on the reasons behind the Ukrainian crisis, 20 percent of Russians named the wrong political course chosen by the Kiev authorities, 19 percent said it was the result of a deliberate provocation on the part of the United States, and 13 percent answered that the crisis stemmed from the typical struggle between politicians and businessmen for power and resources.

"26 Feb, 2016","Pentagon update: US, not Russia, responsible for breaking Islamic State","The Pentagon has a lot of money to spend on propaganda. But its white-washing Russia out of progress in Syria has an increasingly propaganda-savvy audience howling, and is a poor use of resources. This week, the Pentagon information machine made some pronouncements which saw the light of day in media outlets which includedAOLand theDaily Mail. In materially identical pieces, US Army propagandist Colonel Steve Warren fires off several rounds of bullet points to the effect that Islamic State is“beginning to crack”under the“onslaught of air strikes and counter-terror measures”, and that would-be jihadis are realising that""this caliphate isn't all unicorns and rainbows""– whatever that means. His main bombardment consists of the notion that we have the US to thank for this progress. He says:“We see them having lost about 40% of the territory that they held at the pinnacle of their strength in Iraq, and they have lost about 10% of the territory they once held in Syria. We believe this failure is due to several factors, the first and foremost I believe is the presence of devastating Coalition air power. ""Second is the increasing capability of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq. ""And third is the increasing cohesion, strength and unity of the 65-nation coalition that has come together to defeat Daesh.” The problem with the colonel’s presentation from a propaganda point of view is that it is not very good. It is too blunt. People are more sophisticated than this – even people who spend a lot of time on the Daily Mail website. Whether you like Putin or not, his decisiveness in Syria was a game-changer. After years of pretending to chase ISIS, the US was suddenly shown to have been merely simulating activity for entirely different ends. Russia, on the other hand, went in to clean house and has worked effectively with the army of Syria to that end. Any grown-up apportioning of credit which leaves out the key players discredits itself before it begins. It’s like trying to discuss 'Gone with the Wind' without reference to either Scarlett or Rhett. Yet this is Colonel Warren’s approach. He simply disregards everything which doesn’t suit him: the fact that the US-led“coalition”has no legal mandate in Syria; that Assad is the democratically elected head of that country; that the US is engaged in destroying arbitrarily and unilaterally (in fact, if not in name) yet another foreign state which has done it no harm; that – finally and emphatically – if the resolve of this group of US-sponsored terrorists is“beginning to crack”, it is thanks entirely to the efforts of the Syrian Army and the air support provided by the only outside country to have a legitimate role in Syria: Russia. #ISISeasy to defeat if#Turkeyand#SaudiArabiadid not support it – Assad’s adviser to RThttps://t.co/JY5GJCdSCZpic.twitter.com/ND8VdtlBrO The colonel has a tough job on his hands. Too many people now understand that what is needed for the defeat of so-called Islamic State, is for the US government to cease providing it with arms and funding. They know that this chameleon-like organization only makes any sense when seen as an arm of US-Israeli policy; to Balkanise the Middle East and make it easier to control, and to facilitate the theft of their wealth by corporations; its secondary purpose – in combination with the efforts of men likeGeorge Soros– is to create the blowback needed to justify an invasion of Europe by an army of aggressive, unskilled young men in order to asset-strip it, drag it into chaos, and prevent what the US fears most: a new union built around afreer Germany co-joined with Russia. Agents of US military ambitions such as the CIA have always created media outlets - or subverted existing ones – as part of propaganda wars against foreign countries. But two thorns appeared in the side of this policy in recent years. Firstly, in a world connected by the internet, propaganda intended for foreign consumption routinely feeds back into the US arena, thereby falling foul of laws against the use of US tax dollars to conduct informational war against the taxpayers themselves. Secondly, again in a world connected by the internet, US citizens are increasingly discovering uncomfortable truths about everything from 9/11 to banking and medical cartels. Thus, distrust of government internally is a growing problem for those tasked with managing the population. As ForeignPolicy.comnotes, the philosophical foundation for the policy of not using US tax dollars to propagandize US citizens was to maintain a distinction between the US and the Soviet Union. Happily for those burdened by such concerns, the Soviet Union is no more, and in 2013 the US removed the last fig leaf of pretense that the US government did not engage in propaganda internally. This makes everything simpler. The war propaganda machine can lump the US citizenry together with everyone else and get on with the job of bringing – or keeping – everyone on board with whatever the Pentagon’s masters wish it to do. In a war scenario – and the US is almost always making war on someone – budgets extend and keep themilitary industrial complexmaking more for its shareholders. The guiding principle of those who get the government contracts which collectively make wars happen is to ensure that the last penny gets spent so that the same amount – or preferably more – will be forthcoming in the next financial period. The US military, then, is a huge state-run business in the form of a bureaucratic and accounting machine tasked with blowing things up as a function of securing funding. It manages to kill a lot of people, but it is a blunt if heavy instrument. It was described to me by a friend – then himself serving in US Army Intelligence – as“the Post Office with bombs”. Like any large organization it works on a system of protocols. There will be a manual somewhere which tells you what a nail is, what a hammer is, and how the two are to be used together. Then – in the context of the US military – there will be a Halliburton contract for huge numbers of hammers and nails, and a general somewhere with shares in Halliburton who will find a use for both. In the view of military planners, then, propaganda is just another hammer. Recent figures are conspicuously hard to find, but Fox Newsreportedback in 2009 that the Pentagon was spending $4.7 billion annually on what it calls""the human terrain""of world public opinion, employing an army of 27,000 whose sole mission was the promotion of US military objectives via media. What the numbers are today, we can only guess. But it won’t be less – because it never is. Planners of military propaganda will allocate their budgets the same as any public relations company. That is, they will focus on predetermined demographics and opinion leaders – endlessly testing and measuring to see what is working, what not – and using the data thus generated to provide the engine for new, expensive proposals to the client. The delivery method – or ‘tactic’ to use public-relations speak – which Colonel Warren employed this week has become almost hackneyed through over-use. It is to claim the narrative as fully owned; to assume the conclusions one wishes to see as given; to deny the existence of either the legitimate claims – or participation – of any party or view but those which suit one’s agenda. While many consumers of propaganda may not understand this model intellectually, increasing numbers recognize it viscerally. They have an intuitive appreciation of the genre, having been exposed to it many thousands of times. The state of Israel uses it to exclude the Palestinians from any debate about their own land; corporations use it to achieve and maintain monopolies; governments use it to keep people paying income tax. Subconsciously, the model is associated with various forms of oppression and tyranny. This hammer-and-nail school of propaganda has its roots in a vertical and uniform, pre-internet informational model. The model today is broad and disparate; people can shop for opinions. The colonel’s activities this week will have helped eat some small part of the budget, but I would argue that this particular assault was a bad use of resources. It is too on-the-nose. It looks too much like what it is: a hammer. And as people rumble the type of tactic employed above by the Pentagon, they tend to regard the source thereafter as unreliable on point of principle – not a good outcome if your goal is to cultivate""the human terrain""of world public opinion to your advantage. @SamGerrans LISTEN MORE:  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger. His award winning blog can be found at www.neilclark66.blogspot.com. He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Ukraine has chose for its entry to this year’s Eurovision Song Contest, ’1944’, a song all about the forced deportation of 240,000 Crimean Tatars ordered by the dictator Joseph Stalin in the 1940s. Never mind the contest’s rules which bans songs of an overtly political nature; never mind the fact that Stalin was not the leader of Russia but the Soviet Union, and that he was a Georgian and not a Russian. Despite all that, let’s use Eurovision to engage in some crude Russia-bashing, shall we? I’m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily. ‘1944’ opens with the chilling description:""When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we’re not guilty.” ""I had to write it. It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it,”saysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar-Armenian family. I’m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier. ""There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow,""went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry 'Ding-a-dong,' performed by Teach-In back in 1975. But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead-singer of Teach-In. Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia. There’s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done - especially if, like me, you are a long-standing Eurovision fan who’s been watching the event since the 1970s. The provocative, politically-motivated decision to chose ‘1944’ as their ‘Song for Europe’ goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision. The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows. Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory. But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward. When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons. When Johnny Logan performed ‘What’s Another Year’, the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn’t singing about the Anglo-Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest. Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking. The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision. Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of ‘1944’? Believe it or not, it’s not just Ukrainians - or Crimean Tatars - who have had some very bad things done to them in the past. The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999. The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars. Russia could sing about the 5.7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France’s invasion of 1812. The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica. The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe. Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings. And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years. And so on. Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities - and even genocides. Few countries in Europe haven’t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point - and on top of that there‘s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider.But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on - and singing about - today. It’s not the first time those with an anti-Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign. In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: ‘We don’t Wanna Put In’. The artists did not deny their song was a""protest against Russian policies"". The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so. Therulesof Eurovision state that""No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest.”Ukraine’s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia’s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March. Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There’s method in Kiev’s apparent madness. If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she ""just had to write"", in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it’ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent. We’ll all be under pressure to give the song ‘Douze Points’ to show our ‘solidarity’ with Ukraine. If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote. Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that 'free speech' is under threat in Europe because we can't hear '1944'. I’m sure we’ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself. Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it’ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala. The West’s ‘free speech’ crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites. They didn't say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year’s Eurovision - not for the lyrics of their song, which was called ‘Wars for nothing' but because one of the captions in the song’s videocontainedthe words: ‘2014 Gaza two-thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children’. Israel wasn't mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war. But that didn’t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary’s broadcasting authority, with the result that the ‘offending’ words in the video were removed. While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting ‘Israel who’s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests’ Hungary’s Eurovision entry’ there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting ‘Wars for nothing’. Already the sort of media outlets you’d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and ‘1944’. Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) ""Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them… I would not want to see history repeat itself,"" Jamalatoldthe US Congress-funded station. ""RFE/RL is smart power. Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for,""saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009. Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics! ""The Ukrainian authorities are going to try to use the song… capitalizing on the tragedy of the Tartars to impose on European viewers a false picture of alleged harassment of the Tartars in the Russian Crimea,""Crimea's deputy prime minister Russlan Balbek hassaid. He’s right to be offended. The head of Ukraine‘s National Remembrance Museum has also done his best tostir things up. He said that should Jamala win the contest in Stockholm, next year’s event would be held in Sevastopol. Now there’s just one small problem with that. Sevastopol is no longer part of Ukraine. It’s part of Russia. The city council of Sevastopol has declared that the only way it could host Eurovision 2017 is if Russia wins this year. Does Ukraine really want us to go to war over where the Eurovision Song Contest is held? To debase an international song contest in the way that Ukraine has done is disgraceful. By focusing on crimes which occurred in the 1940s, Jamala is also helping to divert international attention away from the economic plight of Ukraine today. A country that was once the food basket of eastern Europe is now, thanks to the illegal US/EU sponsored coup of 2014, a veritable basket case. It’s hard to get one‘s head round the figures.Ukraine’s foreign trade has slumped 31 percent in just one year. Ukraine's foreign trade collapses 31% in just one year, post EU-backed couphttps://t.co/xVfNUpkOiH Inflation last February wasestimatedto be running at 64.5 percent a month. Ukraine’s GDP meanwhile fell for six successive quarters following the ‘democratic revolution’ of February 2014, while real wages fell by almost 25 percent in the year May 2014-May 2015. The people in Maidan were supposed to protesting against corruption, but Ukraine - surprise, surprise, remains themost corruptnation in Europe. In fact, looking at how wretched everyday life is for ordinary people in ‘liberated’ Ukraine today, one can fully understand why Jamala is so keen to take us back to 1944. If she was really brave, she’d have penned a song called '2014’ that discussed the ‘regime change’ activities of Victoria Nuland and their consequences. ‘She handed us cookies out in the square, and when we next looked at our wage packets, there was nothing there’… You can follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Keiser was in Amsterdam this weekend where he spoke with Pirate Party activist Ancilla Tilia in an attempt to dive deeper into the treaty's details. The Dutch electorate goes to the polls on April 6 to decide whether they want to establish an agreement to bring about closer political and economic ties between Ukraine and the EU. Ancilla over Oekraine-referendum en@voorstemnlbij The Keiser Report:https://t.co/fqvNw0UeNf|@ncilla@maxkeiserpic.twitter.com/Zhg04Hjlgu Keiser is wary of the role special interests groups are playing, citing Monsanto and its drive to expand the use of GM“foods”in the Ukraine as well as George Soros and“his project to nowhere.” “This is like a George Soros pet project to get the Netherlands wrapped up in the Ukraine so he can work out his own frustrations, inner turmoil and psychological baggage,”said Keiser.“Haven’t we had enough of George Soros?” He fears the agreement is“bull”and its passing could result in Monsanto’s GM seeds being used next to Russia. “They have (US diplomat) Victoria Nuland, who did that coup. Her husband (Robert Kagan) is a lobbyist for Monsanto. They want to put in genetically-modified seeds into the Ukraine, which is right on the border of Russia and Russia is saying ‘we don’t want genetically-modified seeds because it’s poisonous, it’s carcinogenic',”said Keiser.

"18 Feb, 2016",What matters most: Human rights or the rights of Western governments?,"It seemed unthinkable that after the Iraq tragedy and the ensuing chaos that followed the 2003 US-led war there would ever be any support for another attack on an Arab country. And yet eight years after the invasion of Iraq, international opinion almost unanimously supported NATO operations in Libya. Conveniently labeled'no fly zone'at inception, the idea was to wage war against Muammar Gaddafi and force him out of office, like Saddam Hussein before him. The escalation from simply stopping Libyan planes from flying to bombing raids would not have been acceptable to an ever increasingly skeptical public without the much needed support of the'human rights'industry. This prosperous sector operates the easily marketable commodity that is'humanity’. The idea is that some organizations, based in Western capitals, have a moral imperative to decide what humanity is and how it should be dispensed. Their'respectability'should derive from their fairness, objectivity and commitment to justice. That of course is in principle, in reality their objectives are shaped by those who fund them and allow them to operate. In the case of Human Rights Watch, one of the most high profile NGOs today, its connection to the US government was so intimate that notable academics and scholars penned a letter in 2014 criticizing its executive director's close links or'revolving door'policy with the US State Department. That relationship is so cozy that while many grassroots activist have denounced the US over police brutality or the disproportionate number of black victims as well as the number of inmates currently held in custody without trial it begs the question of why would a human rights organization which aims to dispense its values to numerous governments across the world appear so blind to the very abuses committed on its own doorstep. The answer is that HRW, today viewed as one of the two major human rights organizations alongside Amnesty, only looks at the errors committed by countries whose politics the US disapproves of. HRW favors an interventionist agenda and as a result supports almost all wars waged by the US under the cover of'humanitarian responsibility,'even when the consequences of these military operations would always lead to increased human suffering. In the case of the conflict in Syria, HRW's Ken Roth, at the helm of the organization far longer than the average Arab president remains in power, was pushing the now debunked story of Assad forces using chemical weapons against civilians in Ghouta.His public statementsthrough social media contradicted even UN reports carried out on the ground in a bid to pursue what he qualifies as a“responsibility to protect.” However, that“responsibility”is often carried out through bombing operations.The approach in the US is that a Western response is always best and that ultimately only“Westerners know best.” Despite boasting'divisions'for each region of the world (Africa division/Middle East division etc.) the staff manning these sections are almost all exclusively American with only local researchers appointed to junior or mid-ranking positions. With all the intellectual competence in these various geographies, it should have seemed reasonable to expect senior figures in an organization with an international outlook to have a more international team and yet that is far from the case to this day. When even its largest donor, multi-billionaire George Soros argues that HRW has“to be more effective and be seen as more international, less an American organization,”something is clearly wrong. But when Soros donates a staggering$100 millionto an outfit with such proven ties to the US government what does he expect in exchange? In these times of war and climatic instability, feeding the hungry and providing health care to the ill would take priority over offering a huge sum of money to an organization that already operates on a very comfortablebudgetof around $50 million per year. George Soros is no ordinary man; he is one of the wealthiest financiers on the planet who has made no secret of where his politics lie. Earlier this month, hewrotein the UK's Guardian that Russia’sPresident Putinwas one of the greatest threats to Europe. While appearing to be critical of both sides on the Ukraine-Russia tension, HRW continues to portray Russia as a brutal dictatorship that allows no dissent feeding into the now deeply ingrained perception across much of the West that Russia constitutes a major threat to Europe, another one-sided view that is in accordance with US policy and not internationally, where Russia enjoys far greater support outside Europe and North America. Another interesting appointment was that of Tom Malinowski in 2001. He was Senior Director on the National Security Council at the White House, before becoming Washington Director for Human Rights Watch. Since he left HRW he has returned to a US government position where he nowservesas Assistant Secretary in the Bureau for Democracy in the State Department. Because of its close ties to US officials as well as donors with very clear agendas, HRW has seen its credibility suffer a major blow. More nuanced organizations such as Amnesty International operate far more effectively due in great part to their astute politics. Avoiding all the pitfalls, HRW fell into, AI has in recent years been the respectable face of the now discredited human rights industry and yet its support for avoidable wars has been just as serious if not worse. While present in the early days of the Libyan uprisings, AI teams were able to witness the absence of massacres reported across the Western media. Keen to'sell'a necessary war to Western audiences some'rebels'were courting Western outfitsspeaking of10,000 protesters slaughtered in a matter of days later proven to be false. AI hadissuedstatements with headlines pointing almost exclusively to government forces attacks before stating, some paragraphs below, that“both sides”were committing atrocities. The attention grabbing headlines were enough to make the casus-belli stronger and analysts and observers, incapable of questioning the motives behind the misleading headlines, would later be unable to challenge such subversive descriptions of the conflict, a conflict that would eventually leave Libya a failed state in the hands of various terrorist groups. As with most if not all NGOs, AIfocusesalmost exclusively on violations of human rights committed in third world countries therefore giving the impression that violations are only committed outside the West. While its members continuously campaign for African leaders to be handed over to The Hague to face prosecutions for war crimes, it is yet to make any public pronouncement on the former British prime minister's role in the war in Iraq, despite Britain being a signatory to the International Criminal Court of justice. It has therefore become a comforting short-cut to denounce government politics while turning to'human rights'organizations representing a moral compass, albeit in accordance with Western opinion. While some projects are at times commendable, it appears that these operations' close relationships with Western authority points to a sinister agenda that simply sugar-coats the horrors of war. Human rights should be about ensuring people live in dignity and sheltered from unnecessary violence. What the human rights industry has provided is a new narrative:“if you die as a result of a Western bomb”than you've been“responsibly protected.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"16 Feb, 2016",Soros (seriously) underestimates his audience by blaming Putin for EU refugee crisis,"George Soros, the billionaire investor whose own native country of Hungary accused him of “betraying Europe” by supporting refugees escaping war-torn regions of the Middle East has turned around and blamed Vladimir Putin for the humanitarian crisis. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge In anopinion piecereleased last week, Soros seeks to prove that President Putin was working“to foster the EU’s disintegration”by flooding the continent with refugees, allegedly as a result of the Russian military’s foray into Syria where it has dealt a lethal blow to Islamic State forces. George Soros is no fool, of course. He will go down in the history books as“the man who broke the Bank of England”– an achievement that, while conspicuously lacking a moral chromosome and ethical outlook, took no small amount of mental finesse to pull off. And that’s why Soros’s anti-Putin rant is so strange: it is so illogical and blatantly wrong-headed - to the point where a sense of desperation oozes between the lines. Soros’s argument comes down to this: Putin’s decision to launch a military offensive in Syria was not to halt the encroachment of Islamic State, the most despicable gang of terrorist thugs to step foot on the world stage, but primarily as a means of“dividing Europe.” And I quote:“An EU that is coming apart at the seams will not be able to maintain the sanctions it imposed on Russia following its incursion into Ukraine,”he wrote.“On the contrary, Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti-European parties that he has carefully cultivated.” Unsurprisingly, this line of rubbish failed to hoodwink the overwhelming majority of readers – which Soros apparently believes are too ignorant to connect the dots between Syria, Russia and Europe. Indeed, it was sheer entertainment perusing the Guardian’sreader commentsection following the article, which proves Soros seriously underestimates his audience’s grasp of geopolitical issues. My personal favorite anti-Soros jibe came courtesy of Peter Whitelaw, who wrote:“We’ve been bombing the Middle East off and on for the past 30 years. Russia does it for two months and they are the biggest threat ever. If we’re not bombing Middle Eastern countries…then we’re selling arms to them so they can do the bombing instead of us.” To that succinct comment I would add the question: If Soros really thinks it such a horrible thing that refugees from the Middle East and beyond are storming the gates of Europe, why has he been advocating on behalf of just such a scenario for many years now? In October, Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, whose country finally halted the flow of refugees by installing a razor-tipped fence along the length of its southern border,called out Sorosby name when he said the schemes of“well organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation-states and leader who have never been elected”could come to fruition.“Europe has been betrayed,”Orban continued.“If we don’t stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here.” Orban’s public chastisement of Soros’ behavior is not without foundation. One month before the Hungarian leader voiced his concerns, Soros had published yet another opinionmasterpiece, this one entitled, “Rebuilding the Asylum System.” In it, he expressed bewilderment that“each member state [of the EU] has selfishly focused on its own interests”to the point where the asylum seekers“have been the main victims”(Incidentally, I’ve yet to hear Soros come out and defend the hundreds of German women who were sexuallyassaultedby refugee men during the course of New Year’s Eve celebrations). With an arrogance that almost defies belief, Soros goes on to argue – as if the European people have absolutely no say in the matter whatsoever – that since“the origin of the current crisis is Syria, the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority…”therefore the European Union has an obligation to“distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states.” Blood and Tears: Chaotic scenes at Hungarian border as#refugeescome under tear gashttps://t.co/TXvLxfdfoDpic.twitter.com/mgBnHDKXwD This breathtaking comment is followed by a 6-point plan for the EU to follow. It should suffice for our purpose to just quote Soros’ first point, which alone probably launched 1,000 right-wing parties in Europe:“The EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future… and provide €15,000 ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs.” As my colleague Lionel would say, let that comment marinate for a moment: ""The EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future?"" Really? Now take a second and perform a simple reality check and ask, Which individual is really seeking the disintegration of Europe: George Soros, with his Open invitation to every asylum seeker in the Middle East and beyond (it has already been exposed in the German media that the majority of asylum seekers entering Europe do not come from Syria, but are predominantly from other countries that were previously torn asunder by US-backed military offensives/adventures, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) or Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was formally invited by Damascus to initiate a military offensive against ISIS forces, which up to that point had not been noticeably weakened despite Western claims that it was fighting the terrorist organization? Furthermore, what would Russia stand to gain by flooding the European continent – of which it is a geographical part of – with desperate asylum seekers, many of whom may actually be card-carrying members of lethal terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and Islamic State? Finally, Russia’s economy would hardly recover anytime soon if Europe - its largest trading partner - is somehow reduced to violence, sectarian strife and chaos as Soros somehow asserts. Given Soros’ powerful influence and clout among some European bureaucrats, it seems his outrageous anti-Russia position has gained some traction among some predictable circles. This is especially the case with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is desperately in need of a scapegoat for the refugee crisis as far-right nationalist groups, likePegida, are enjoying a groundswell of public enthusiasm – not just in Germany but also across Europe. Exactly one day before Soros’ anti-Putin piece hit the newsstands, Merkel was paying a visit to Turkey, of all places, where she… Well, let’s just let George Soros explain what she was doing there:“Angela Merkel flew to Ankara on February 9 to make last-minute arrangements with the Turkish government to induce the refugees already in Turkey to prolong their stay there. She offered to airlift 200,000-300,000 Syrian refugees annually directly to Europe on the condition that Turkey prevent them from going to Greece and will accept them back if they do so.” Yes! With a wave of Merkel's magic wand, no more unsightly photo opportunities from nosy journalists featuring throngs of unwashed hordes storming the EU gates. Why, that would have derailed George Soros’ – oops, I mean Vladimir Putin’s – plan to overrun Europe with a future low-wage labor pool and a divide-and-conquer carnival. Just what Europe needs as their venal leaders – in reality, nothing more than mindless technocrats – enforce harsh austerity measures on young and old alike. Merkel just cut through all the unsightly mess and awarded the refugees frequent flier mileage points right smack into the heart of Europe – where they will be paid €15,000 ($16,800) each if Soros gets his way – courtesy of European taxpayers – that is, those who are still employed and can pay taxes. Meanwhile, last but not least, Soros rarely spouts venom at Turkey, Saudi Arabia and all of the other usual suspects who are in some way complicit in the extremely curious rise of Islamic State, a group of savages, we are led to believe, that possessed enough business savvy to become the owners and operators of a lucrative oil business, exporting vast amounts of Syria’s finest right past the Turkish border and into European gas tanks. Nor did Soros have any harsh words of condemnation for Turkish President Erdogan, who extended his thanks to Russia for cleaning up Syria’s terrorist infestation problem by shooting a Russian fighter jet out of a clear blue sky in November, thereby ratcheting up tensions in the Syrian theater to unprecedented levels. Unfortunately, individuals like George Soros, who certainly have the funds and the brains to make a positive difference in places like Europe and Syria, have chosen instead to spread vicious anti-Russia propaganda so thin and conspicuous it actually flies back and damages their own misguided cause, as opposed to the purposeful actions of their purported enemies. @Robert_Bridge This article first appeared in a slightly altered form inRethinking Russia.

"13 Feb, 2016",George Soros: A psychopath’s psychopath,"According to Soros, Russia’s strategy is to “avoid collapse by making the EU implode first – by exacerbating the migration crisis and stoking Islamophobia”. On February 11,the Guardianran anarticleby George Soros which had run a day earlierhereentitled “Putin is a bigger threat to Europe’s existence than Isis.” After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion. Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros’ article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order. I have met a few psychopaths in my life – a pernicious but small-time example is a real-estate “salesman” in Spain who cost my family a great deal of time and money. The real problem with psychopaths – big-time and small-time – is not primarily that they do bad things, but that we – non-psychopaths – are ill-prepared to deal with the fundamental difference between us and them. We – people with operational consciences – think (wrongly) that everyone is like us. We are shackled to the assumption that just because we would not do unspeakably evil things – or would be unable to live with ourselves if we did – all other people work the same way. They do not. When a psychopath lies, or steals, or manipulates – or does whatever he thinks is required to get what he wants – he has no greater emotional connection with his actions than you or I have with yesterday’s lunch. We, the non-psychopaths, tell little lies and do little wrongs. But we have a limit beyond which we will not go. For the psychopath, scale makes no difference. Stealing a family’s savings, or crashing an economy, or destroying a country is of no more consequence to the psychopath than deciding not to return ten bucks to a cashier who had made a mistake. And no matter what evil the psychopath meticulously plotted and practiced against you, to him, what happens is your fault. Always. Which brings me back to George Soros. Inthe Guardian’sarticle, then, Soros claims “the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State.” The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood. My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writerGearóid Ó Colmáin, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so-called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what Ó Colmáin rightly calls a “tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite”. In an interview withRT, Ó Colmáin said, “There is no War on Terror. There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony. And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe. In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies. There is no such thing as ISIS. ISIS is a creation of the United States.” Soros and his ilk created and benefit from what Soros calls “Islamic State,” yet his argument not only disregards that fact, it kicks blame in the direction of the one major power – Russia – which has taken steps to deal with this US creation. Soros goes on to make a number of other accusations against Russia, failing at any time to note that Russia alone has a mandate from the legitimate government of Syria, or that Russia is seriously engaged in cleaning house in Syria, a job the US was only simulating. Acknowledgement of Russia’s successes in Syria comes from many quarters, includingSeymour Hersh. Hersh is a high-profile American journalist, but one incapable of understanding the reasons for US policy towards Syria, bless him. Soros’ next point is that “Putin’s aim is to foster the EU’s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees.” The truth is that Russia’s natural ally is Germany – and preventing that alliance is the primary aim of the US government – at least according toStratfor, a US intelligence agency. Germany’s efficiency and organizational abilities combined with Russia’s raw materials, inventive genius, and good relations with China, is the combination those funding and directing ISIS least want to see. By occupying Germany with an army of aggressive, unskilled, culturally insoluble economic migrants from Africa and elsewhere, the chess-players at the board of realpolitik are attempting to head off that natural outcome. Soros’ part in destabilizing Europe is well attested.The Daily Mailreported back in November 2015 that Soros was busy telling the EU to take “at least a million” refugees every year. In the same article, Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is quoted as saying, “This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state.” Orban went on, “This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros.” Soros – described in the article as “a funder of pro-migration groups all over the world” – responded to Orban’s comments by arguing that his beliefs “uphold European values”. I don’t know what Soros means by “European values,” but I assume it includes lots more immigration for us – unilaterally decided upon by Mr. Soros. As prime minister of Hungary, Orban is a man with, perhaps, better access than most to the truth about George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary – the source for which information is his own father’s book Masquerade – Dancing Around Death in Nazi-Occupied Hungary. Thus, Soros has moved effortlessly from collaborating with the Nazis against his fellow Jews – an occupation (if you will excuse the pun) he makes little effort to hide – totellingindigenous European peoples what the ethnic make-up of their countries should be. He was also instrumental in the destruction of Ukraine. As reported byNew American, Soros “has a giant footprint in Ukraine. Similar to his operations in dozens of other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens ofmillions of dollarsinto Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into a more ‘open’ and ‘democratic’ society.” We have good reason to take George Soros seriously. Soros’ article downplays Putin’s strategic prowess before going on to anticipate regime change in Russia in 2017 as a result of bankruptcy forced upon it by Western sanctions and crushed oil prices. He then appears to credit Putin with masterminding a “collapse” in Europe and of anticipating benefits for Russia in the aftermath. He notes, “As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy it.” If you find yourself asking here: “Why then did she create that crisis?” that is because you are not a psychopath. Soros’ article begins its descent with metaphysical and social observations, which from someone without billions of dollars behind them would be seen as merely subjective musings, before landing squarely on the runway of identifying Putin’s Russia as the real threat. This is not simplychutzpah. The traits Soros exhibits are those of textbook psychopathy: blaming others for his own actions and attacking the victim is what the psychopath does. Here, Soros disregards entirely his own extensive role in creating the problem he purports to seek to solve; meanwhile, he accuses Russia, the only country to man-up to the war on Syria, of being behind the “migration” Soros has spent millions engineering. Soros is part of a cabal which plans the overthrow of countries at dinner. Psychopathy is the baseline requirement for membership. So if you think conscience will make him and his friends stop at some point before you and your family reach conditions materially identical to those experienced by the inhabitants of the Donbass region – or if you think that Western Europe is beyond the scope of their plans for engineered collapse just because you wouldn’t do something like that – you will find that you are wrong. When Europe is in tatters, and its men (whom Soros’ money helped turn in one lifetime from actual men into effeminized liberal cultural lemmings) are squawking in disbelief as their pampered delusions are shattered in the “collapse” Soros envisages, Soros will not care. No matter that this is Europe and it is your life under attack this time, and not that of brown people or Eastern Europeans. It won’t make any difference. For a psychopath it’s simple: you let him do it – it’s your fault.

"11 Feb, 2016","Soros: 'Putin aims at EU disintegration, threat from Russia bigger than from jihadi attacks'","American and EU leaders are making a ""grievous error"" by taking Russian President Vladimir Putin for their ally in the fight against Islamic State, billionaire investor George Soros has stated. Putin’s real aim is the EU’s disintegration, Soros alleged. In an opinionpiecefor Project-syndicate.org, the billionaire stated that""the best way to [cause the disintegration of the Euro bloc] is to flood the EU with Syrian refugees."" ""There is no reason to believe that [Putin] intervened in Syria in order to aggravate the European refugee crisis,""Soros says.“But once Putin saw the opportunity to hasten the EU’s disintegration, he seized it. He has obfuscated his actions by talking of cooperating against a common enemy, ISIS [Islamic State/IS, also known as ISIL]."" The veteran US investor goes on to say it is“hard to understand""why both Europe and Washington ""take Putin at his word"" instead of""judging him by his behaviour."" “The race for survival pits the EU against Putin’s Russia,”Soros says.“ISIS poses a threat to both, but it should not be over-estimated. Attacks mounted by jihadi terrorists, however terrifying, do not compare with the threat emanating from Russia.” According to Soros,“Putin’s Russia and the EU are engaged in a race against time: The question is which one will collapse first.” “The Putin regime faces bankruptcy in 2017, when a large part of its foreign debt matures, and political turmoil may erupt sooner than that."" Soros speculates that the EU may be doomed to disintegrate due to its current problems:""Ever since the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent rescue packages for Greece, the EU has learned how to muddle through one crisis after another. But today it is confronted by five or six crises at the same time, which may prove to be too much. As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy the EU."" He further maintains that""Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti-European parties that he has carefully cultivated."" In October 2015, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban lashed out at Soros, blaming him for fueling the refugee crisis in Europe. Orban criticized the support Soros had expressed towards refugees from the Middle East heading to Europe, saying that the billionaire undermines stability on the continent. Soros made a name for himself as the""man who broke the Bank of England""by engaging in questionable Forex hedging and betting against sterling – which made him more than $1 billion in one day in September 1992. Some speculate that Soros has been the beneficiary of insider trader information while making investments. In 2002 a Paris court found Soros guilty of using inside information to profit from the 1988 takeover deal for bank Societe Generale. In November, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office recognized George Soros’s Open Society Institute and another affiliated organization as undesirable groups, banning Russian citizens and organizations from participation in any of their projects. Prosecutors said the activities of the Open Society Institute and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation were a threat to the foundations of Russia’s constitutional order and national security. The Soros Foundation started working in Russia in the mid-1990s, but wrapped up its active operations in 2003. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"2 Feb, 2016","Gangs, populism, and conspiracy theory overshadow West’s role in refugee crisis","In the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, Europe continues to lurch to the right, both in the visible form of neo-Nazi gangs terrorizing the streets, and also with politicians playing to right wing populism. From Stockholm to Dover, gangs have been terrorizing refugees or anyone they perceive to look like one, while also attacking anti-fascist protestors. These gangs by their own admission are reacting to what they perceive to be their own government’s failure in responding to the crisis.  The fact their governments caused the crisis is a fact which is apparently lost on them. In reality, all these gangs are achieving is to simply play into the hands of the very same governments who happily pipe up about the problems associated with the refugee crisis, while at the same time continue to cause it, with the bombs they drop, and the terror groups and regimes they prop up. Nobody in their right mind wants to see any of the crimes associated with the refugee crisis take place, whether we are taking about wars which cause people to leave their homes, or the problems associated with Europe’s inability to deal with the crisis. States in Europe have laws in place to deal with murder, rape, assault, and any other crimes which take place.  All of us want to see an end to misogyny and murder wherever it manifests, whether it is committed by groups or individuals, or committed by states on an industrial scale. However, in the current climate, any crime committed by anyone perceived to be a refugee, is immediately brandished in the headlines as proof that all refugees are bad.  The same yardstick or measure is not applied to other ethnicities or faiths.  If it were, it would probably offer some uncomfortable truths, or reveal the many holes in such pseudo-scientific thinking. The phenomena of street gangs and politicians playing to the right, is a result of Europe and the West reacting to the crisis, rather than taking an honest look at its causes. The‘way of life’many of these groups (and politicians) are talking about‘protecting’, is less to with any Christian values, and is in reality, grounded in propping up the failed economic model of neo-colonial capitalism, which itself is predicated on the continuation of illegal wars and subversion of the Middle East and Africa. In the same way this model has fooled many of the working classes in Britain, themselves victim of this model, into voting for a political party of the ruling class offering them more of the same economic‘safety’ultimately causing their misery under‘austerity’, this thinking has also caused a dangerous form of reactionary nationalism in Europe to resurface. Rather than look at the root cause of the crisis, imperialism, and understand the relationship between war and Western economies, the masses have been duped into believing that the refugee crisis starts and ends with the actual refugees themselves, despite the obvious reasons as to why they have arrived in Europe. This thinking is completely westernized and Eurocentric, and provides a convenient scapegoat for the architects of war: Rather than lay the blame for the crisis at the hands of governments and the neo-colonial institutions which support their interests, the refugees are blamed.  Women, children, it makes no difference as newspaper headlines last week show. Or worse still, as we are seeing, more and more people are buying into the idea that a shadowy cabal is behind the crisis, or George Soros and Rothschild Zionists, all intent of course, on destroying Europe’s way of life by causing a mass exodus from Africa and the Middle East, to Europe’s green pastures. Apart from being untrue, this thinking also reeks of anti-Semitism, and the sort of racism which should remain dead and buried and which needs no revival.  It also is very damaging to the left, because it delegitimizes actual progressive thought.  The more this thinking occupies the centre ground helped by the media, the further away from a solution we drift. This simplistic scapegoating also diverts away from the fact that it is developed Western economies and the policy which underpins and drives them, which has led to this crisis. There is no conspiracy.  It’s more like business as usual.  The refugee crisis is a direct result of both colonialism and in the modern era, neo-colonialism, the more sophisticated incarnation of modern capitalism, implementing its own barbarism under the perverse justification of ‘humanitarian’ intervention. In other words, as Europe’s thinking goes,“It’s not enough that we used to occupy and colonize you, you clearly remain incapable of governing yourselves, and so therefore, it is our job to come and do it for you, and to democratize you in the form of bombs and McDonalds.  When you come to our shores fleeing our bombs, we will do anything and everything to avoid blaming those who should be blamed including politicians, the wars they advocate, and the consumerism we worship.” It is this psychology, or psychological deficiency depending on your view, which underpins the origin of the refugee crisis, and also which now, rather than seeking to diagnose it, will do anything to explain away what is happening-except of course look at the actual cause. No shadowy cabal or conspiracy theory is needed to explain what is happening here.  People are fleeing their homelands because there is a very real conspiracy by Western governments and its proxies to destabilize and destroy them. German police should have right to shoot refugees illegally crossing border – AfD leaderhttps://t.co/yrqa1EUDNXpic.twitter.com/SfYnobWCtO The relationships between Africa, China, and the Middle East are still developing. Russia and China at least, while far from having a perfect relationship with Africa, are at least offering a functional one, and more importantly are perfectly distinguishable one from the West’s imperial relationship with Africa and the Middle East. The West’s strategy in Africa the Middle East, in the Wake of the‘Arab Sting’, is simply one of‘divide and ruin’, meaning that“if we (Western governments) can’t control your resources, then no one can.”The West would rather destroy whole countries, and turn them into failed states and torch their resources, than allow states to have a functional relationship with each other with indigenous populations benefiting from the wealth. This is how the problem manifests internationally. At home, Europe and the West would rather blame a shadowy cabal, or delude themselves that‘the others’Arabs, Muslims or Africans are the problem rather than their own governments. This is the problem Europe is failing to recognize, which is giving the US also complicit in wars of aggression, a‘free pass’. Until we start to diagnose the problem, rather than engage in right-wing populism and neo-liberal denialism, ugly scenes like those we have seen in Britain, France, and Germany will continue.

He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Meanwhile at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos this week, the business, financial and political elites who have helped create the mess we’re in, sipped expensive champagne, networked, and gave us lectures on what we need to be doing to sort things out. World is in a bad way from wars, global refugee crisis to economic mayhem but none @#Davos2016apologised for their leadership over it The World Economic Forum says it is ’ committed to improving the state of the world’. But in fact the world was in a far better state before the WEF (originally called the European Management Forum), was established in 1971. For the majority of people of the planet, but not for the super, super rich, things have gone backwards since the first Davos meeting was held. That’s no coincidence as Davos - for all the ’progressive’ waffle about ‘stakeholder theory’ and the ’global public interest’ - is all about maintaining an elite-friendly, neoliberal economic order which has caused so much economic, social, cultural and environmental damage. Holding court at Davos this year, as in other years, was the octogenarian hedge fund billionaireGeorge Soros, the 16th richest man in the world according to Forbes, with a net worth of $24.5bn.Soros usually bashes Russia at Davos, and this year was no exception. He accused Vladimir Putin of making the refugee crisis worse by bombing Syria, saying that the Russian President wanted the EU to""collapse"". Never mind the funding and arming of so-called ‘rebels’ in Syria by the West and its regional allies - let’s blame Putin! The fact is that Russia’s intervention in Syria has blocked the regime-change plans of the Western elite, which is exactly why the likes of George Soros are so angry. Soros wasn’t the only George talking twaddle in the Swiss Alps. British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborneaddressed‘British business leaders’ at the CBI’s lunch, where he hailed the economic achievements of the UK government, and called the UK economy""a chink of light cutting through the global gloom.""Of course Osborne failed to mention the fact that as Chancellor he presided over thelongest drop in real wagesfor over 50 years. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls made headlines when he told the BBC at Davos the quite stunning news that the refugee crisis was destabilizing Europe. He did not of course mention France’s role in destabilizing Syria and Libya - and that this destabilization (together with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003) was the major cause of the refugee crisis. Refugees are not destabilising Europe. Europe is destabilising themhttps://t.co/YMiz7i3h2Ovia@MiddleEastEye Wherever we look at Davos, we see hypocrisy and double standards.Oh look, there’s the millionaire rock star Bono, the anti-poverty campaigner whose band U2 moved part of their business from Ireland to the Netherlands in order to pay less tax. And who’s that giving an interview about the current refugee crisis-triggered by western ‘interventionist’ policies in the Middle East - why it’s the serial interventionist Tony Blair! And who’s this impartial observer saying that ""the best result you might be able to get"" in Syria was ""benign Balkanization, benign cantonization"". Why it‘s Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu! Other ‘highlights’ of Davos included Harry Potter actressEmma Watsongiving a talk on gender inequality. ""Women share this planet 50/50 and they are under-represented, their potential astonishingly untapped,” Watson told a forum where just 18 percent of the attendees were women (up a whopping 1 percent from 2015.). It’s not just a sexual imbalance you see at Davos, but there’s a distinct preponderance of North Americans and Europeans at an event billed as a WORLD Economic Forum as thisdiagramdemonstrates.One of the relatively few Africans to get an invitation to the elite get-together in the Swiss Alps, was Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda. Rwanda has undoubtedly made some progress under Kagame, but it’s come at a cost. The latest Amnestyreporttells us:""Freedoms of expression and association in Rwanda continued to be unduly restricted by the authorities. Rwandans were unable to openly express critical views on issues perceived as sensitive by the authorities and the environment for journalists, human rights defenders and members of the opposition remained repressive."" I wonder if George Soros had a word with Mr Kagame about his passionate belief in the ‘Open Society’? You don’t have to be a Che Guevara or Rosa Luxemburg to wish that the ‘World Economic Forum’ and all its hypocrisy, was confined to history. 'The fact that business and political leaders can, over the space of a couple of days, meet “everyone who matters” isexactly what’s wrongwith it and with the world,’ says Steve Hilton, a former director of strategy for David Cameron. Hilton is right: It’s ludicrous to look to Davos for solutions, as its exclusiveness is an integral part of the problem. Q: How to avoid the impression the world is run by a global elite? A: All go to a luxury Swiss resort very yearpic.twitter.com/0cm9PJSFOj It's worth reflecting on how well the world was doing before Professor Klaus Schwab had his ‘bright’ idea for a ‘European Management Forum’. The 1960s was an era of great economic, social and cultural advances for ordinary people across the globe. These advances continued into the 1970s. The world had never before been so democratic and never before had its wealth been so evenly shared. But starting with the coup which toppled the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and saw him replaced with the capital-friendly dictator and human rights oppressor Augusto Pinochet, the global economic order was restructured in the interests of a tiny but very greedy elite who were unhappy that their share of the cake had shrunk in the genuinely progressive period following World War Two. A hallmark of this neoliberal era has been the way states have been captured to serve the interests of international finance capital and giant global corporations. Publicly owned assets have been privatized, providing rich pickings for the banks and financial institutions who handle the sales. Meanwhile, the very rich have enjoyed generous tax cuts - if they even pay tax at all. Meanwhile, austerity is imposed on the majority. Davos has played a key role in this process. If the World Economic Forum has a habit of coming up with big-business-friendly solutions it’s no surprise, as itsmembers""comprise 1,000 of the world’s top corporations, global enterprises usually with more than US$5 billion in turnover."" Last week, as the well-heeled attendees arrived in Davos in their private jets, Oxfamreleasedits latest report on global inequality. The report revealed that the richest 1% now own more than the rest of the people in the world combined. A more shocking indictment of forty-odd years of neoliberalism would be hard to find. ""It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super-rich - so few, you could fit them all on a single coach,""says Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB’s chief executive. He might also have said we could fit the small group of the global super-rich in one hotel in Davos, which is where most of them probably were last week. We won’t get any meaningful change arising from anything proposed at Davos because the iniquitous status quo is in the interest of those who fund the World Economic Forum. To solve the problems of today we need to do away with elite gatherings attended by ‘everyone who matters’ and re-democratize our politics and our economies. In short, we need to take power away from the billionaires who meet each year at Davos, and return it to the people.

"29 Dec, 2015",Soros Foundation promoted drug legalization worldwide - Russian official,"The plan to legalize marijuana in the US was developed for export to foreign countries, and the Soros Foundation and other NGOs have sponsored reports promoting the spread of soft drugs, the head of the Russian anti-drug agency FSKN said in a TV interview. Speaking on TV channel Russia-24, Viktor Ivanov said the illegal drug trade in the western hemisphere had caused the rise of thousands-strong cartels that have started to oppose local governments through political demands and armed struggle. “This is the reason why the Soros Foundation has sponsored a number of reports, including those in the London School of Economics,” he stated. Ivanov also explained that the referenda on the legalization of medical recreational marijuana in various US states had been held in Spanish, possibly because the whole plan had initially been developed for Latin American nations. Once started in the United States, the idea of legal marijuana was spread throughout South and Central America by US-based NGOs such as the Soros Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation, the official claimed. READ MORE: ISIS uses Turkey for trafficking heroin to Europe – Russian anti-drugs chief In July Russian prosecutors declared the Soros Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation “undesirable groups.” The move was prompted by reports from regional authorities that were concerned about alleged subversive activities by certain organizations. Under Russian law all citizens and organizations are banned from any cooperation with undesirable groups under threat of administrative fines. Members of banned NGOs who persist in their intention to carry out activities on Russian territory can face prison sentences of up to six years. President Vladimir Putin has ruled out the possibility of the legalization of soft drugs in Russia. The main argument is that marijuana consumption often makes people more open to the idea of “hard” drugs that cause addiction and ruin lives.

In addition, Ivanov called upon all countries interested in countering the drug threat to create a global alliance for the alternative development of Afghanistan through forced industrialization. Other measures included an international sanctions list targeting landlords who profit from drug production, and also making the destruction of opium and marijuana fields an official objective for the International Security Assistance Force.

"4 Dec, 2015",Prosecutors recognize another US-based NGO as ‘undesirable’ for Russia,"The Prosecutor General’s Office has recognized the US-Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (USRF) as undesirable organization, banning Russian citizens and companies from any cooperation with it. Agency spokesperson Marina Gridneva told reporters on Friday that the decision to put the NGO on the list of undesirable foreign organizations was made after prosecutors had thoroughly studied its work on Russian territory. She also noted that USRF is headed by a US citizen who has been banned from entering Russia until 2025. USRF was registered in Russia in 2009 as an affiliate of the US group bearing the same name. The group states its mission as “support of market economy” and “strengthening the ties between Russian and the US.” It operates mostly through grants. READ MORE: Prosecutors ban Soros Foundation as ‘threat to Russian national security’ Russia introduced the law on undesirable foreign organizations in late May this year. This act allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to create a proscribed list of “undesirable foreign organizations,” making the activities of such groups in Russia illegal. The main criterion for putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is a “threat to constitutional order and defense capability, or to the security of the Russian state.” Non-compliance with the ban is punishable by administrative penalties, and for repeated and aggravated offenses can carry prison sentences of up to six years. Russian citizens and organizations that continue to work with banned groups would face administrative fines only. Non-government groups in Russia and abroad criticized the new law as “exotic” and said that it could lead to Russia’s isolation from the international community. Russian sponsors of the law replied that it was more of a preventive measure and it was not targeting any particular organizations.

"30 Nov, 2015",Prosecutors ban Soros Foundation as ‘threat to Russian national security’,"The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office has recognized George Soros’s Open Society Institute and another affiliated organization as undesirable groups, banning Russian citizens and organizations from participation in any of their projects. In a statement released on Monday, prosecutors said the activities of the Open Society Institute and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation were a threat to the foundations of Russia’s Constitutional order and national security. They added that the Justice Ministry would be duly informed about these conclusions and would add the two groups to Russia’s list of undesirable foreign organizations. Prosecutors launched a probe into the activities of the two organizations - both sponsored by the well-known US financier George Soros - in July this year, after Russian senators approved the so-called “patriotic stop-list” of 12 groups that required immediate attention over their supposed anti-Russian activities. Other groups on the list included the National Endowment for Democracy; the International Republican Institute; the National Democratic Institute; the MacArthur Foundation and Freedom House.

It requires the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to draw up an official list of undesirable foreign organizations and outlaw their activities. Once a group is recognized as undesirable, its assets in Russia must be frozen, its offices closed and the distribution of any of its materials must be banned. If the ban is violated, the personnel of the outlawed group and any Russian citizens who cooperate with them could face heavy fines, or even prison terms in the case of repeated or aggravated offences.

"13 Nov, 2015",There's something strange in the neighborhood: StratCom East's ghostly targets,"The primary target of StratCom East, a new European Union information initiative, and its project Mythbusters, was supposed to be RT. Bustin' should’ve made them feel good! Yet, when it comes to finding fault with the Russian broadcaster’s reporting, the EU’s‘Disinformation Review’seems to be coming up short. In their first report, RT gets two bizarre and unrefuted mentions and in the 2nd, the network isn’t cited at all. Russian foreign media services are a drop in the ocean compared to their Western competitors. There are literally thousands of them across NATO’s 28 member nations. State-funded and their private equivalents. Available on TV, in print, on radio and online. They are broadcasters, think tanks, bloggers, NGOs and so-called ‘citizen journalists.’ Some of them are extremely well-paid and others do it voluntarily. All of them united in a desire to expose“propaganda”- the catch-all phrase used to describe anything that contradicts the NATO narrative. This dastardly“Russian propaganda”is usually defined as content from RT, Sputnik and – if Westernmainstream mediais to believed – about 50 online“trolls”. Nevertheless, when forced to actually locate some tangible examples of alleged false reportage or disinformation, they can’t find very much. Of course, all media has lapses and bloopers. Especially in a fast-paced 24-hour news environment. It happens to RT, just as it happens toThe New York Timesand theBBCand many others who on occasion might carry a story that turns out not to be 100 percent accurate. The difference, however, is that when RT commits a blooper, it’s“Russian propaganda”- and replayed for years to come - but when American or European outlets bungle, it’s a“mistake”even if it’s ever acknowledged, it’s forgotten about almost immediately. First announced in March, the EU’s ‘Mythbusters’ team is now publishing weekly updates of its ‘disinformation review.’ The introductionpromises“to show the European public the high amount of such disinformation attacks that target European audience (sic) every single day”. This presentation turns out to be a six-page spreadsheet with lots of blank spaces. RT is mentioned twice in Stratcom East’s first report. With no explanation as to why the ‘mythbusters’ find either article offensive. Indeed, the“disproof”section, which is supposed to explain what’s offensive about the piece, and supply facts instead of presumed fiction, is totally blank. In the first article, RTreportedthat the head of“Russia’s Security Council (Nikolay Patrushev) has warned of ‘a real problem’ posed by the growing number of US-controlled laboratories that produce biological weapons.”Yes, RT reports Patrushev’s words. There is no spin on his comments. No opinion whatsoever. It’s just a normal news story. Who, what, where and why. Basic journalism. Ivana Smolenova, who highlighted the article, has provided no explanation for why it offends her sensibilities. Maybe she was having a bad day and didn’t like the content? This is the sameMs. Smolenovawho works as Communications and Outreach Manager at the Prague Security Studies Institute (PSSI). Of course, the PSSI ispartneredwith the Atlantic Council, RE/RFL, NATO and George Soros’ Open Society Foundation - all big fans of RT. The first two mentioned were involved in last week’sUS Senate Hearingsabout the network. The otherentryconcerns RT’s Russian language website. Dmytri Spivak, of Kiev’s Dragomanov University again leaves the“why?”column blank when drawing attention to a piece about German media. As a Kiev resident, it’s safe to assume that Mr. Spivak can understand Russian. Thus, he will have noticed that the article is atranslation, via InoTV, from the Austrian Contra Magazin. This is clearly explained in the opening sentence. So after all the hype, there are just two RT entries in Stratcom East’s first spreadsheet, one of them actually of European origin - both with empty ‘disproof’ columns attached. As mentioned, in the 2nd ‘Mythbusters’ report, RT doesn’t feature at all. Those funding the exercise must be already looking for their money back. How do we know the supposed target is RT? The EU Observersaidso earlier this year. Then,PoliticoandThe Guardianboth followed up the story. The former reported that the head of the“task force”is Giles Portman, a British career diplomat. According to Politico,“Portman reports to Michael Mann, the head of the EEAS’s strategic communications team who was a spokesman for former high representative Catherine Ashton.” Portman’s LinkedInprofilehighlights his role as deputy head of the British Embassy in Turkey for four years:“Policy and corporate leadership to UK's network in Turkey of eight posts, 250 staff and £7m budget.”It wouldn’t be surprising if he yearns for those halcyon days. Now, he has a staff of an unknown number of ‘media monitors’. Yet, the public officials and media executives of these countries are so alarmed about Russian news media and RT in particular, that they are crying out in unison about“losing the information war.”On top of beefing up their countries’ broadcasting budgets, NATO, the UK, and the European Union are all creating special initiatives and even military groups to push back on Russian media, ostensibly in the hopes that“more of the same”will turn out to be the winning formula after all. The whole purpose of Stratcom East is difficult to comprehend. It smells of a bureaucratic response to a non-existent threat. Russia, as a single country, has limited resources for foreign media. The 28-member NATO zone boasts state-funded international broadcasters like Euronews, BBC (in numerous incarnations), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, France 24 and Deutsche Welle. This is in addition to NATO’sPublic Diplomacy Divisionand the UK’S“77th brigade""ofinformation warriors, which numbers 1,500 military personnel. On top of this, there are hundreds of private media outlets which are loyal to the West’s position on Russia, from new media like Buzzfeed and The Daily Beast right down to traditional newspaper and TV giants, distributing content in numerous languages. By comparison, Russian news media is actually rather small. For example CNN’sannual budgetof $750 million is two and a half times larger than that of RT ($300 million), and it’s unclear whether that even includes the budget of CNN International, its global broadcasting arm. And yet, CNN is only one channel of hundreds parroting the mainstream Western foreign policy narratives. In the UK, thepublicly fundedBBC, has around $7.7 billion (to spend in 2015, a good chunk of which goes to news, both domestic and international (please seehereandhereif you’d like to get bogged down in the details of BBC’s news services-related spending). Next year, Russianstate mediawill receive $1.3 billion. That’s for everything, both domestic and foreign. However, the UK press continues to insist that Russian“propaganda”is“lavishly funded”andoverpowering, at home and abroad. For comparison, BBCspentmore than this sum - around $1.5 billon - just to refurbish its news HQ two years ago. Clearly, this is not a fair fight. The combined Western media outguns Russia by a factor of dozens - if not hundreds - to one. It’s the equivalent of the US army taking on the forces of Grenada or Panama. Despite their abundance of resources, the Western establishment is constantlyscheming upnew ways to reverse the supposed ‘infowar’ losses  to Russia. Yet with every new“strategic communication”effort, it becomes apparent that EU’s, and the West’s messaging problem is neither money nor shortage of special g̶h̶o̶s̶t̶b̶u̶s̶t̶e̶r̶s̶ mythbusters initiatives but the trite, tired, and Cold War-mired narratives that are still been served to their viewers, readers and listeners.

"4 Nov, 2015",Soros's ‘European values’ mean losing your national identity – Paul Craig Roberts,"To be part of the European Union means you have to shed your national identity and be part of everybody. It is no longer acceptable to be yourself. This agenda serves the 1 percent and Washington, Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist, told RT in an interview. Billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has attracted attention once again, this time saying the European Union should take""at least a million""refugees every year to ease the mass exodus of desperate people from the Middle East and Africa.Soros wants the EU to dig deep and pay an annual amount of""at least €5,000 per refugee, or €20 billion."" And this coming at a time of severe austerity measures pushed onto the European people, not to mention the bailout of entire countries, like Greece. The Lonely Chancellor: Merkel Under Fire as Refugee Crisis Worsenshttps://t.co/ZqV8ScWwzQ Thus, it's little wonder that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says philanthropists like Soros must assume part of the blame for the current crisis. ""This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state,""Orban told reporters.""This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros."" Soros responded by issuing anemailstatement to Bloomberg Business, claiming his international organization works to“uphold European values”,while Mr. Orban’s efforts to fortify the Hungarian border thereby halting a massive wave of illegal migrants“undermine those values.” “His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle,”Soros added.“Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.” READ MORE: Hungarian PM blames Soros for fueling refugee crisis in Europe Paul Craig Roberts offers his own interpretation as to what has precipitated this crisis of epic proportions as millions of foreigners now descend en masse on European communities, many of which are totally unprepared for the influx of foreigners. It is“Washington’s wars,”not George Soros per se, that are forcing the refugees to flee their homelands and seek to enter Europe, Roberts believes. “Since the Clinton regime, we’ve had three two-term American presidents who have been at war,”he said.“They have created millions of displaced people and they are now seeking refuge in Europe.” Merkel’s stance on#RefugeesCrisis‘naive, irrational’ – former Czech presidenthttp://t.co/8tMFCf8IHNpic.twitter.com/uvONW5UUIw Roberts also asks whether Soros’ advice regarding Europe absorbing millions of refugees is based on something other than just humanitarian considerations. “We have to first ask the question whether Soros’ progressive causes are real or merely a cover for rule by the 1 percent,”Roberts said.“You see, when political boundaries are broken down the result is a power vacuum to which Washington and the 1 percent can move in their pawns.” One consequence of Washington’s wars over the course of three presidencies has been to“destroy stable countries and leave in their place disorganized, small fiefdoms that war on one another,”Roberts said. “What Soros means is: ‘European values’ means you lost your national identity and you become a hodgepodge of different cultures and different nationalities and your traditional historical existence is dissolved in this pot of diverse peoples.” Migrants & refugees sue Berlin’s main refugee center for delays to welfare handoutshttp://t.co/uXEPqpEfJOpic.twitter.com/fbri4tcGHq Roberts applauds Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orban], saying he is“exactly correct that this is a threat to the existence of European peoples because they become dissolved in a so-called diverse society of different people, different religions, different cultures, different values.” But for those individuals - like George Soros - who comprise the 1 percent of the global elite, their goal is to redefine what it means to be a European. “George Soros is in effect saying: ‘We are redefining Europe. Europe no longer consists of Hungarians, British, French, Germans and Greeks, etc. It now consists of everybody. And all of you historical people to be European means you have to be part of everybody. You can no longer be yourselves.’ That’s the message.” Refugee rhetoric reminiscent of pre-Holocaust sentiment – UN human rights chiefhttp://t.co/BWeB1Qaiohpic.twitter.com/Bdi98Gp4Zw Yet there is little resistance to the agenda because Europeans have heard the same message repeated so many times they have been“brainwashed,”which then makes it“easy for their so-called leaders to open the borders and accept all of these refugees that Washington’s wars have created.” Roberts also makes a dramatic claim, saying that every country that joined the European Union has committed“an act of national suicide.” “It seems to me that of all the leaders of Eastern and Western Europe, the Hungarian prime minister is the only one that has any sense. He says: ‘We’re not going to commit suicide.’ If Germany wants to commit suicide, fine. If they want to follow Merkel into suicide, let them. But not us.” Hungary's PM accuses George Soros of undermining European nations on refugeeshttps://t.co/FfRIHODV4wpic.twitter.com/37Ba6hvKlb Roberts then turns his attention to Ukraine and the political strife that has rocked the nation, arguing that that non-government organizations were busy behind the scenes destabilizing the country so as to prop up a Western-friendly puppet leadership.Indeed, Western non-government organization have been operating freely in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Roberts, it should come as no surprise as to where the funding for such large-scale, operations originates. “And all of these non-governmental organizations, they are funded by private donors, such as Soros, they are funded by the Department of State, the National Endowment for Democracy and they all serve as agents of Washington foreign policy. And this is the way that very wealthy individuals like Soros come together with the government.” But this is not just an act of aggression against the Ukrainian people, but“an attack on Russia itself,”Roberts says. “This is an effort to weaken Russia, to threaten Russia, to make Russia back off from its resistance to American hegemony over the world,”Roberts proclaims. These behind-the-scenes operations, which work under the cover of lofty-sounding agencies, benefit the United States by“making it impossible for a European government to exist independently and therefore Washington does not have to worry about European governments – such as Germany – realizing that their own national interests are contrary to American national interests.” Ultimately, the work of these philanthropists and non-governmental organizations“is designed to break apart European national identity in order to prevent any sort of loss of the American empire to independent foreign policies among European countries,”Roberts says. “If you don’t have a country, you can’t have a foreign policy. What is the foreign policy of Libya [laughs]? What is the foreign policy of Iraq? What is the foreign policy of Afghanistan? What is the foreign policy of Somalia? They have none; they have no governments. They have no national identities.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"14 Aug, 2015","‘Anti-Maidan’ activists seek Russian ban on Hells Angels, Bandidos","A Russian conservative movement has asked the authorities to recognize two major US-based motorcycle clubs as ‘undesirable’ groups, saying bikers could be used by foreign forces to push a ‘color revolution’ upon the country. The Anti-Maidan movement addressed the upper house Committee for Constitutional Legislation, saying the activities of the clubs “that name themselves Hells Angels and Bandidos” are already banned in many countries and suggesting that Russia follow suit. The address also said members of these clubs were violating Russian laws and that they were among active participants of violent events on the Independence Square in Kiev that led to the change of government in Kiev, and eventually to the military conflict in the southeast of Ukraine. The Russian activists warned that bikers from the two clubs can be used as the main physical force in an attempt to launch a ‘color revolution’ in Russia. The ‘Anti-Maidan’ movement was founded in January 2015 in Moscow by a group of social activists to counter the ‘color revolutions’ that they believe could pose a threat to Russia’s security and its very existence. The name is derived from the Ukrainian word Maidan, which originally meant ‘city square’, but is now being used to describe anti-government protests seeking regime change. READ MORE: 40,000 take to Moscow streets in ‘Anti-Maidan’ demo The address to the Federation Council was signed by two anti-Maidan leaders – politician and writer Nikolay Starikov and Aleksandr Zaldostanov, the head of the openly pro-Putin Russian Night Wolves motorcycle club. Last year Zaldostanov and his club were included in the US and EU sanctions lists over their alleged role in the reunification of Russia and Crimea (the Russian bikers held several festivals in Sevastopol both before and after this event). On Thursday, Russian Senator Andrey Klishas asked the Prosecutor General’s Office to launch a probe into the activities of Hells Angels and Bandidos so that the authorities could make a decision about whether to recognize them as undesirable.Russian business daily Kommersant on Friday published an interview with a Russian member of the Hells Angels MC presented as ‘Ivan the Hippo’, who blasted Zaldostanov’s address as complete lies and “behavior not worthy of a gentleman.” He also suggested that the real motive behind the motion could be competition between Hells Angels and Night Wolves. The bill on undesirable foreign organizations was introduced in Russia in late May this year. The new law allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to create a proscribed list of “undesirable foreign organizations,” making the activities of such groups in Russia illegal. The main criterion for putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is a “threat to the constitutional order and defense capability, or to the security of the Russian state.” Non-compliance with the ban is punishable by administrative penalties, and for repeated and aggravated offenses can carry prison sentences of up to six years. Russian citizens and organizations that continue to work with banned groups face administrative fines only.

"28 Jul, 2015",US National Endowment for Democracy labeled ‘undesirable’ group under new law,"Prosecutors have recognized NED’s activities in Russia as undesirable and undermining national security after the US NGO spent millions on attempts to question the legitimacy of Russian elections and tarnish the prestige of military service. According to the release published on the Prosecutor General Office’s website deputy head of the agency Vladimir Malinovsky on Tuesday signed the decision to recognize as undesirable on the territory of the Russian Federation all activities of the foreign non-government organization the National Endowment for Democracy. On the same day this decision was forwarded to the Justice Ministry that must now include NED in the list of undesirable foreign organizations. Prosecutors added in their report that the decision was based on the analysis of the endowment’s recent work. This analysis showed that it controlled some Russian commercial and non-commercial organizations and used them in campaigns aimed at recognizing the results of Russian polls illegitimate, influencing the authorities’ decisions through political actions and discrediting of the Russian military forces. Foreign Ministry praises law banning undesirable foreign groups in Russia The release reads that in 2013 and 2014 the National Endowment for Democracy rendered $5.2 million in financial aid to its Russian partners. According to RBC the endowment itself has earlier reported that in 2014 alone it satisfied 95 Russian applications for aid amounting to $8.4 million. The National Endowment for Democracy, founded in 1983 on Ronald Reagan’s initiative, is sponsored by the US Congress and sees its main task as helping the democratic institutions all over the world. The Russian Justice Ministry has earlier recognized this organization as the most active provider of various grants in politics and politics-related spheres, such as sociology or political research. The NED was also included in the very first draft of the ‘patriotic stop-list’ – the document approved by the Russian upper house that names the groups that the senators see as potential threat to security and want to be probed and, if these suspicions are confirmed, officially declared undesirable. The bill on undesirable foreign organizations was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin in late May. The new law allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to create a proscribed list of ‘undesirable foreign organizations’, making the activities of such groups in Russia illegal. The main criterion for putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is a “threat to the constitutional order and defense capability, or to the security of the Russian state.” Non-compliance with the ban can be punished by administrative penalties, and for repeated and aggravated offenses can carry prison sentences of up to six years. Russian citizens and organizations that continue to work with banned groups would face administrative fines only. As the sponsors of the bill faced criticism from the domestic and international rights community, they replied that it was more of a preventive measure and it was not targeting any particular organizations.

"16 Jul, 2015",Senior diplomat vows ‘harsh prevention’ of attempts to influence Russian internal politics,"The Foreign Ministry’s special representative for human rights says Russian authorities will thwart any attempts to sponsor intervention in domestic politics, but strictly through legal and political mechanisms. “Of course we will cut short efforts to pay for interference in our internal affairs, for example through non-government organizations. This will be done through political and legal means, but harshly and without doubts,” Konstantin Dolgov said in a recent interview with Rossiiskaya Gazeta gaily. He added that it was possible to directly speak about the restrictions because when Russia approved these laws it did not abandon any of its obligations in the spheres of human rights and the rule of law and, “unlike some Western nations, Russia did not violate any international laws.” The official also told reporters that Russia had not initiated the decrease in the dialogue with the West. The United States, on the contrary, allowed itself several demarches – both during the current Ukrainian crisis and before it. Dolgov added that regardless of these facts Russia remained open and ready for discussions if these discussions are held between equal partners and without any “mentor tone.” At the same time, the rights representative promised that he and other Russian diplomats would continue to implement Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy course including the advancing policy in the human rights sphere. “We have never stated that there are no problems with human rights in Russia. But these organizations [foreign NGOs] are often reluctant to take into consideration the efforts that our nation undertakes in order to get rid of these fault and at the same time they cover up the large-scale problems that have matured in the European countries and the USA.

READ MORE: Justice Ministry to add Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia NGO to list of undesirable groups - report In early June this year, the Russian Federation introduced the Law on Undesirable Foreign Organizations, which allows the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to make an official list of undesirable foreign organizations and outlaw their activities in the country. Once the group is recognized as undesirable, all its assets in Russia must be frozen, offices closed and distribution of any of its information materials must be banned. Cooperation with banned groups or participating in their work is punished with heavy fines, or even prison terms in cases of repeated or aggravated offences. The upper house has already prepared and forwarded to the Prosecutor General the first list of 12 groups that the senators want to be included in the blacklist. They include NGOs sponsored by the US authorities, directly and indirectly, the Soros Foundation and several groups with Ukrainian connections. Earlier this month, mass circulation daily Izvestia reported that the list of undesirable foreign organizations could soon be expanded to 20 groups and include the Open Russia NGO, sponsored by Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The head of the Federation Council’s International Relations Committee, Konstantin Kosachev, commented on the report saying that the creation of the stop-list was “a start of the public discussion and not its end,” and that the main objective of the new law was to “create a barrier against forces that openly demand regime change in Russia.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"8 Jul, 2015",Upper house approves first list of 12 ‘undesirable’ foreign groups,"Russia’s Federation Council has released a list of foreign organizations it plans to declare ‘undesirable’. The 12 entries in the document include the Soros Foundation and the US National Endowment for Democracy. The upper house approved the list on its Wednesday session and
  forwarded the document to the Prosecutor General’s Office, the
  Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry. Speaker Valentina
  Matviyenko told reporters that it had been created out of reports
  from regional authorities that are concerned about alleged
  subversive activities by certain organizations. She also noted
  that the proposed version of the document is subject to change. Matviyenko emphasized that the inclusion of the anti-Russian
  groups on the blacklist would make their work transparent and
  clear for local authorities, political and non-government
  organizations. “Today Russia faces its strongest attack in the past 25
  years, targeting its national interests, values and
  institutes,” reads the Federation Council’s address to state
  agencies. “Its main goal is to influence the internal
  political situation in the country, undermine the patriotic unity
  of our people, undermine the integration processes within the CIS
  space and force our country into geopolitical isolation,”
  the senators state in the document. READ MORE: Putin agrees to corrections of

  is recognized as undesirable, all its assets in Russia must be
  frozen, offices closed and distribution of any of its information

  Party MPs asked the Prosecutor General to use it against George

  for “persistent anti-Russian activities both in Russia and in
  other countries,” in particular for promoting hatred against
  Russians in Ukraine via the destruction of the Russian education

"3 Jul, 2015",Foreign Ministry praises law banning undesirable foreign groups in Russia,"Russia’s deputy FM has told senators that the recently introduced law allowing automatic bans on groups that pose a threat to national security was a necessary step, adding that many such NGOs were in reality funded by foreign governments. “We hold that the passing of the law on undesirable
  organizations was without any questions a step in the right
  direction,” Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said at
  the Friday session of the Federation Council. He added that the
  new law was a significant and much-needed follow-up to the
  “Foreign Agents Law” passed in 2012. Gatilov also said that a long time ago the Russian Foreign
  Ministry had noticed that many organizations working abroad as
  NGOs were in reality funded by their home country’s governments. At the same time, the deputy minister stated that recognizing
  certain organizations as undesirable must happen only after
  serious joint work of several state agencies, and such moves
  should target only particular groups, with detailed explanations
  at every step. Next week, the Upper House of the Russian Parliament is scheduled
  to look into the list of organizations that can be listed as
  undesirable, according to prosecutors’ decisions. Russian media
  has reported that the preliminary list includes 15 groups, but
  has not disclosed any names. READ MORE: Communists want Soros Foundation
  branded ‘undesirable’ group The bill on undesirable foreign organizations was signed into law
  by President Vladimir Putin in late May. The new law allows the
  Prosecutor General’s Office and the Foreign Ministry to create a
  proscribed list of “undesirable foreign organizations,” making
  the activities of such groups in Russia illegal. The main
  criterion for putting a foreign or international NGO on the list
  is a “threat to the constitutional order and defense capability,
  or to the security of the Russian state.” Non-compliance with the ban can be punished by administrative
  penalties, and for repeated and aggravated offenses can carry
  prison sentences of up to six years. Russian citizens and
  organizations that continue to work with banned groups would face
  administrative fines only. Foreign and international NGOs, as well as the Russian domestic
  rights community, criticized the new law as “exotic” and
  “shocking,” while the European Union and the United States have
  officially expressed their concern over the new Russian law. The
  US State Department said in a statement that the move banning
  cooperation with various foreign groups could bring about the
  isolation of the Russian people from the outside world. Russian politicians who had prepared and promoted the bill
  replied that it was more of a preventive measure and it was not
  targeting any particular organizations. The so-called “Foreign Agents Law” introduced in late 2012 orders
  all NGOs engaged in Russian politics and receiving any funding
  from abroad to register as foreign agents or risk substantial
  fines. Groups with “foreign agent” status are banned from
  sponsoring Russian political parties, but otherwise their
  activities are not restricted. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/russia/271456-russia-undesirable-groups-gatilov/
"9 Jun, 2015",Leftists target foreign scholarships to fight brain drain,"The Communist Party says it is working on a bill that would seriously limit the activities of foreign educational organizations to prevent a major danger to the Russian economy – the brain drain. The head of the Communist Party’s law department, Vadim Solovyov,
  told Izvestia daily that the bill would completely ban the work
  of all foreign non-commercial groups and endowments that select
  talented young people and offer them grants and fellowships for
  study abroad. Solovyov blamed the current work of such organizations for the
  deficit of skilled scientists and engineers which, in his words,
  could damage the country’s future development potential. “Any country that starts giving away its future would not
  have any. This is against our national interests. We are
  submitting the bill that would ban the work of the groups that
  take away our talents, like slave traders who transported people
  abroad on pirate ships,” Izvestia quoted the lawmaker as
  saying. Solovyov also said that if the suggested restrictions come into
  force the Russian state would itself launch an effective
  mechanism for selecting gifted students and sponsor their
  education abroad – on the condition that the specialists would
  return and work in Russia. The Communists’ initiative echoes the statements of President
  Vladimir Putin who touched upon the problem of the brain drain at
  the forum of the Business Russia association in May. The
  president said that there were a lot of foundations in the
  country that offered contracts to students who wanted to study
  abroad, but none of these students return to Russia. READ MORE: Communists want Soros Foundation

  not by the NGO’s involvement in the brain drain, but by its
  alleged “proxy subversive operations” seeking to
  overthrow the Russian political regime. They also blamed the
  Soros Foundation for the destruction of the Russian education
  system, manifested in the much-criticized system of single state

Ukrainian ceasefire violations by Kiev – leak,"The US and its Western allies are well aware of all the ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine but, deliberately turn a blind eye to Kiev’s actions, hackers said after obtaining the emails of top Ukrainian official overseeing the truce. The anti-Kiev hacktivist group, CyberBerkut, claims to have
  hacked the emails of Major-General Andrey Taran, Chief of the
  Joint Centre for Ceasefire Control and Coordination in Ukraine. The correspondence contained satellite images proving multiple
  violations of the Minsk peace agreements between Kiev and the
  rebels by the Ukrainian military, they said.  The pictures, dating March, April and May 2015, showed Kiev’s
  heavy artillery stationed in the immediate vicinity of the
  borders of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. Ukrainian 100-millimeter field artillery guns, 122-millimeter
  D-30 and 2S1 Gvozdika howitzers, 152-millimeter Hyacinth-S
  howitzers and Grad multiple rocket launchers were placed less
  than 20 kilometers away from the contact line, CyberBerkut said.  According to the Minsk ceasefire agreement signed in February,
  both sides were to pull-out of all heavy weapons and create a
  security zone from 50 to 140 kilometers, depending on the range
  of the guns. READ

"4 Jun, 2015",Communists want Soros Foundation branded ‘undesirable’ group,"Two senior lawmakers from the Communist Party caucus have asked Russian prosecutors to use the recently introduced law on “undesirable” foreign groups against George Soros’s Open Society organization. “The anti-Russian activities of Soros’s foundation must be
  recognized as undesirable before they assume the destructive
  forms that we could observe in Ukraine, Georgia and other
  countries,” MPs Valery Rashkin and Sergey Obukhov said,
  appealing to the Prosecutor General. The Communist leaders claimed that the Open Society NGO had
  conducted “persistent anti-Russian activities for decades and
  that it happened both in Russia and in other countries. They said
  that the group was allegedly promoting hatred against Russians in
  Ukraine and also launched some “proxy subversive
  operations” in the Russian Federation. In particular, the two MPs blamed George Soros’s NGO for the
  destruction of the Russian education system, manifested in the
  much-criticized system of single state exams for schoolchildren
  as well as underfinancing of schools and institutes. The Law on Undesirable Foreign Groups that came into force
  earlier this week charges the Prosecutor General’s Office
  together with the Foreign Ministry with the task of creating an
  official list of “undesirable foreign organizations” and
  outlaw their activities in the country. The main criterion for
  putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is “the
  threat to the Constitutional order and the defense capability or
  security of the Russian State.”  Once the group is recognized as undesirable all its assets in
  Russia must be frozen, offices closed and distribution of any of
  its information materials must be banned. Violating the bill is
  punished with heavy fines both for the personnel of the banned
  organizations and Russian citizens who cooperate with them. A
  repeat offense can carry up to six years in prison. From the moment it was drafted, the new law was sharply
  criticized by the Russian rights community, foreign NGOs and
  officials. The European Union and the United States have
  officially expressed their concern over it and warned that the
  move banning cooperation with various foreign groups could bring
  about the isolation of the Russian people from the outside world. The two opposition MPs who originally drafted the bill have
  described it as a preventive measure and denied that it was
  targeting any specific foreign organizations. The Open Society Institute, also known as the Soros Foundation
  after its main sponsor, US billionaire George Soros, has worked
  in Russia since 1995 and financed many projects in the
  humanitarian and educational spheres. In 2003, the organization
  stopped issuing direct grants and announced that it had stopped

"23 May, 2015","‘US alienation game to spark WW3, not China’s economic failures’","US billionaire investor George Soros warns the world is on the brink of WWIII unless the US financial system opens up to China. But a former US diplomat told RT that it has nothing to do with the economy, but everything with bad US geopolitical policy. ""If there is conflict between China and a military ally of
  the United States, like Japan, then it is not an exaggeration to
  say that we are on the threshold of a third world war,""
  Soros wasquotedas saying by MarketWatch at the
  Bretton Woods conference at the World Bank. Soros added that if China’s efforts to establish a
  domestic-driven economy fail, it could turn to launching an
  external conflict to distract its population. To avoid disaster, Washington needs to strengthen its economic
  ties with Beijing, according to Soros.  The former US diplomat and advisor to the Republican Party, James
  George Jatras, told RT that “a remote possibility” of
  war is possible, but not because of the economy or China’s
  currency. Potential conflict could only come from the United
  States’ poor geopolitical choices that do not benefit the
  American people. “I do question the reasons he gives for suspecting that there
  is this danger… This has nothing to do with the economy, nothing
  to do with currency, and everything to do with very bad American
  geopolitical policy that has alienated the Russians, it is
  alienating the Chinese and pushing the Russian and Chinese closer
  together. This is not in the American interest,” Jatras
  said. The idea that the China will deliberately provoke a confrontation
  with an American ally to distract its population if its economy
  has problems in the future is “an absurd suggestion,” he
  said. The main problem is the US expanding its security presence right
  alongside “the vital interest of another rising power” for the
  reasons that clearly do not benefit the US. “What we really need to do and what Mr. Soros is not talking
  about at all is to reevaluate what our strategic presence in some
  of these regions that are far from the US, but very close to
  China. There is a possibility of confrontation there.” The US is strengthening its relationships with certain countries
  not based on what is best for its own economy, but what will best
  contain China. “What kind of argument is that? We should be doing things
  that benefit our own country, our own people, our own workers.
  Not because it is going to somehow bottle up China, which I think
  is a dangerous thing to try to do,” Jatras said. “In some ways I think we are doing in the South China Sea
  what we did in Ukraine, with respect to Russia. We are inserting
  a security presence right up against the vital interest of
  another rising power at the reasons not entirely clear how they
  benefit the US.”  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"14 May, 2015","‘Quasi-state Kosovo West’s only ally in Balkans, SE Europe’","Albanians are just a proxy for Western intervention in the Balkan area where it is easy for the West, following its goals, to ignite the Balkan powder keg by playing off ancient ethnic discords, Sasha Knezev, Serbian-American author, told RT. RT:What are the
  root causes of these riots in Macedonia in your
  opinion? Sasha Knezev:It is very simple, they are
  economical. [Macedonian Prime Minister] Nikola Gruevski and his
  government have not imposed sanctions on Russia, just like
  Serbia. Serbia, just north, has not imposed any sanctions on
  Russia. And you have a dubious Serbian public that is very
  skeptical of the EU, as in Macedonia. If we look south to Greece
  - BRICS has just extended their hands to the Greek government.
  And we see Turkey actually being approached by Gazprom to
  construct the [Russian-Turkish pipeline project]. READ
  MORE: Macedonians rally for government resignation amid surging
  political unrest The only real ally that the West and the US have in the Southeast
  Europe and the Balkan area is the quasi-state of Kosovo which is
  in a sort of grey area of its de facto independence. We already
  know that the Western powers, the US set a precedent with the
  violation of theUN’s resolution 1244in granting them
  independence. And we also know that the US has their largest
  military base in Europe in Kosovo, Camp Bondsteel. So it is very easily to ignite the Balkan powder keg by playing
  off these ancient ethnic discords that have gone on for
  centuries. I believe that this is an attempt by the United States
  government, and actually we have Macedonian intelligence
  implicating Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State for
  Eurasia, in trying to do exactly what they did in Ukraine. I think it is economic. Just north of Serbia we have Hungary that
  has been very stalwart and standing up to the IMF's structural
  reform. And if you have all those countries in Southeast Europe,
  than you are at the gateway of Central Europe going to the West.
  And it is purely economic, in my estimation. RT:The US doubts the country’s commitment
  to democracy and Britain has said Macedonia should be looking at
  a transitional government. Do you think this is unnecessary
  interference? SK:Absolutely. Look at the Middle East... How
  many governments have been overthrown on the US behalf and the
  West behalf?... We also know that the US itself is suffering
  tremendous economic crisis and it does all add up… We also have to understand that Kosovo is used. I feel bad for
  the Albanian people because they are just a proxy for Western
  intervention in the Balkan area. And I do believe that this is
  just an attempt to further destabilize the area for political
  gains, for economics mostly. If Greece leaves the EU … and they
  start a sort of domino effect, this could really spell a
  catastrophe for not only for the US but the EU itself. RT:With the pictures that we’re seeing in
  Macedonia, you can certainly entertain the idea that the people
  have a genuine discontent with the people that are governing
  their country, can’t you? READ MORE: ‘ISIS, Albanian extremists – US
  supports anyone who does what it wants’ SK:Yes, absolutely. The Gruevski government has
  its share of problems, no doubt. There is structural corruption
  in several areas of the government. However, that being said we
  should be seeing this play out itself during so many so-called
  colored revolutions of George Soros and the West. We’ve seen that
  in Ukraine. We’ve seen that in the Balkans. We've seen that in
  Greece. So, it is really difficult to determine. That is not to say that the people themselves don't have genuine
  discord in the general state of the economy and the standard of
  living in Macedonia which is bad, as is all of Southeast Europe,
  as is all of Europe in general. We see that reflection in the US
  as well. But that it is always used. It is very easy to … use
  different ethnic backgrounds in inner turmoil to balkanize
  nations and to provide sort of dialectic alternatives that
  ultimately end up benefiting other greater forces. We had that in Baltimore, right here in the US, where the media
  attempts to place it black against white or between different
  ethnic backgrounds. But in actuality we have a systemic police
  corruption that is applicable to all America; they are violating
  all our rights. And collectively, we should address this issue-
  what they are doing to all of us. But instead the media tries to
  play it one against the other: gender, race, ethnic. This is an
  old tactic that unfortunately seems to work every time.

"23 Mar, 2015",‘Ruble unstable for artificial reasons’,"The US has created a belief that money would leave Russia, but money doesn’t flow out of countries that have extremely low debt and strong export earnings, Paul Craig Roberts, former US Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, told RT. RT:Bloomberg'sarticleindicates that there's investor
  optimism about the future of the Russian economy. What are the
  reasons for that? Paul Craig Roberts:Russia’s economy is
  essentially debt-free. Russia has strong export earnings from
  energy. So because of sanctions, these earnings will now be used
  to develop the Russian economy instead of being wasted on imports
  of Western goods. RT:Is it fair to say that, although
  sanctions have hit the Russian economy hard, that they have
  inadvertently helped some Russian firms? PCR:I don’t think the sanctions did hurt or hit
  the Russian economy hard; they hit the financial markets because
  they are subject to disruption by Western speculators. The
  sanctions have helped Russian confidence, and more generally, the
  sanctions have helped the overall economy by creating import
  substitution in a process so that the Russians now are starting
  to make more of their own goods rather than use their earnings
  from energy sales to purchase Western goods. This is a very good
  development. Sanctions have helped to develop the Russian
  economy.  RT:So are the sanctions doing the damage
  intended by Washington? PCR:Washington said that the purpose of the
  sanctions was to hurt the Russian economy. However, the real
  purpose is to break up the Russian- European political and
  economic relationships. Washington is concerned that those
  developing relationships would eventually pull Europe out of
  Washington’s orbit and Washington would lose control. In other
  words its vassal states would become independent because of their
  developing relationships with Russia. So that is the main reason
  for the sanctions. RT:What role has Central Bank policies such
  as amending interest rates and dealing with currency supply
  played in investors' optimistic outlook? PCR:The ruble can be stabilized by Western
  currency speculators. Remember how George Soros destabilized the
  British pound? So what stabilizes the ruble is not the Central
  Bank but its Russia’s internal development and Russia’s
  disengagement from the West, its economic disengagement from the
  West. The best way to stabilize the ruble is to demand payment in
  rubles for energy exports. As Russia develops its trade with
  China and the BRICS nations the ruble will automatically
  stabilize. As long as you are connected to the Western dollar
  payment system you are subject to destabilization. READ MORE: Russian economy revives despite
  sanctions – media RT:How did the rubble decrease affect the
  Russian economy? PCR:The speculators knocking the ruble down
  have raised the price of imports. Therefore this has helped the
  Russia economy. So Russian firms themselves can step in and fill
  more of the Russian demand for goods and services… Russia has
  still the smallest ratio of debt to gross domestic product [GDP]
  of any Western country. That is far below anything in Europe or
  the US. So that automatically means a stable ruble. Russia has
  very strong export earnings from natural gas and oil. The only
  reason the ruble is destabilized is because of Washington and the
  currency speculators…[Ruble] is a stable currency and has very
  reason to be: very low debt, very strong export earnings, that is
  the mark of stable currency. RT:In your opinion, who is to blame for the
  ruble destabilization? PCR:I don’t think the ruble is unstable for
  real economic reasons. It was unstable for artificial reasons. It
  was an environment created by Washington and propaganda. And it
  was created by the belief that all this money would flow out of
  Russia and leave Russia. Generally speaking, money doesn’t flow
  out of countries that have extremely low debt and strong export
  earnings. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

He is the author of'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Before we consider Obama’s revealing remarks, and how the
  Ukrainian people sold their country for a song, let’s rewind to
  November 2013, when then-President Viktor Yanukovich had shocked
  western capitals - and, more importantly, western markets - by
  suspending plans for an association agreement with the European
  Union. Video:
  /files/opinionpost/37/c1/b0/00/2530092_obana_new.mp4 As if on command, thousands of Ukrainians suddenly poured into
  the streets of Kiev to protest the decision. Such a rapid
  reaction should not have come as a surprise. After all, a
  multitude of US government agencies – most notably, USAID - had
  been operating in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
  investing billions on its latest""democratic""pet
  project. This is no conspiracy theory. On December 13, 2013, Assistant
  Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, following her third trip to
  Ukraine in five weeks, told the National Press Club:""Since
  Ukraine's independence in 1991 the United States has…invested
  over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in needs and other goals."" Exactly what those""other goals""may have been, and who
  helped underwrite them, seem rather obvious today.  Although many are tempted to believe otherwise, governments don't
  normally spend such prodigious sums of money in a foreign land
  unless it expects to get something hefty - in this case, Kiev’s
  loyalty - in return. Governments are by nature political
  opportunists, not philanthropists, which is precisely why Russia
  gave USAID the boot in 2012. Ukraine did not, and was forced to
  pay the piper, so to speak. We should note here that it was not just US taxpayer dollars that
  unwittingly provided the funds to support the coup d’ etat in
  Ukraine. In another softball interview with CNN’s Zakaria,
  billionaireGeorge Soroslast May coolly admitted:“I
  set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent
  of Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and
  played an important part in events now.” Certainly those billions of dollars weren’t spent just on
  humanitarian work, like distributing pastries to the Ukrainian
  rabble gathered on Independence Square. After all, the crucial
  question as to who would lend Ukraine a multi-billion dollar
  rescue package was the elephant parked on Maidan that few talked
  about. Once upon a time, western financial institutions had the
  market cornered on the lucrative task of bailing out
  cash-strapped countries. Today, however, other economic agencies
  - BRICS for example - are able to compete with the IMF. But after
  Kiev exploded in chaos and violence, the regular lender of last
  resort bagged itself another national trophy for above its
  fireplace. Michael Hudson, of Counterpunch,summed upthe IMF victory:""In April
  2014, fresh from riots in Maidan Square and the February 22 coup,
  and less than a month before the May 2 massacre in Odessa, the
  IMF approved a $17 billion loan program to Ukraine’s junta.
  Normal IMF practice is to lend only up to twice a country’s quote
  in one year. This was eight times as high."" Hudson said the loan,
  given at a time of civil war, proved that the Washington-based
  financial institution functions as""an arm of US Cold War
  politics."" ""Kiev used the loan for military expenses to attack the
  Eastern provinces, and the loan terms imposed the usual budget
  austerity, as if this would stabilize the country’s
  finances.""  For anybody who still believes those billions of dollars were
  spent just to prop up democratic institutions need only consider
  the harsh historical lessons from places as diverse and distant
  as South America and the Middle East. Time and again, from Chile
  to Iran, Washington propped up puppet dictatorships to serve its
  purpose. Proving this charge is as simple as eavesdropping on a telephone
  call conversation between Nuland and the US Ambassador to
  Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt. Almost one year ago to the day, Nuland was heard outlining
  Washington’s vision of Kiev’s future""democratic""structure. Nothing terribly ironic about that, right? While much
  of the amused media focused its attention on Nuland’s“F*ck
  the EU”verbal bomb, that was mere child’s play compared to
  the meat of the conversation, which spelled out exactly who
  Washington wanted in power in Kiev. Nuland:…I don't think Klitsch
  [Vitaly Klitschko, one of the opposition leaders] should go into
  the government. I don't think it's necessary, I don't think it's
  a good idea. Pyatt:Yeah. I guess... in terms of
  him not going into the government, just let him stay out and do
  his political homework and stuff…. Nuland:I think Yats
  [Arseniy Yatseniuk, current prime minister of
  Ukraine]is the
  guy who's got the economic experience, the governing experience.
  He's the... what he needs is Klitsch and Tyagnibok [Oleg
  Tyagnibok, the other opposition leader] on the outside. He needs
  to be talking to them four times a week, you know. I just think
  Klitsch going in... he's going to be at that level working for
  Yatseniuk, it's just not going to work.  Pyatt:Yeah, no, I think that's
  right. OK. Good. Do you want us to set up a call with him as the
  next step? Or, instead of enduring the obscenities of a Nuland conversation,
  one could simply wait for Barack Obama to sum it all up in an
  interview with CNN all-star softball pitcher Fareed Zakaria. Instead of challenging Obama on the question as to whether
  US-NATO policies in Eastern Europe - which, aside from moving
  inexorably eastward to Russia’s border, also excludes Russian
  participation in the US missile defense shield - have in some
  substantial way contributed to the deterioration of relations
  between Russia and the US, Zakaria merely dangles the“Russian aggressor”carrot before Obama, who of course
  blames the entire mess on Putin, while admitting to something
  incredible, yet entirely believable.  READ MORE: US envoy to Ukraine caught posting
  fake images on Twitter Obama told CNN's Zakaria that Washington“had brokered a deal
  to transition power in Ukraine""following on the heels of
  the deadly“protests on Maidan and Yanukovich then
  fleeing.”[Interview segment available in above
  video]. While Nuland’s colorful conversation one year ago told us
  everything we needed to know about Ukraine’s so-called democratic
  transition, it’s a completely different thing when the“deal”is admitted to by none other than the American
  president. Washington power brokers, desensitized to the concept of
  brokering political“deals”due to their so-called
  democratic work in faraway war zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
  Libya, think it normal operating procedure to employ the strategy
  inside of sovereign states that are experiencing internal
  discord. The real tragedy of such a scenario is not so much that it is
  happening, but that the United States, and the Ukrainian people,
  it seems, believe that a foreign invasion of political
  opportunists on their territory constitutes democracy or will
  somehow lead to democracy. I'd wager to bet that Ukraine will
  very soon resemble Greece, where the people had firsthand
  experience with foreign-enforced austerity measures and,
  employing real democratic procedure as opposed to backroom
  brokered deals, introduced real democracy to elect politicians of
  the people, for the people and by the people. But then again, the United States expected no less from the $5
  billion, and a few cakes, it paid for Kiev’s pledge of
  allegiance. Now the Ukrainian people must dutifully follow that
  foreign-built road wherever it may lead them. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"13 Jan, 2015",George Soros makes hush-hush trip to Kiev,"Billionaire George Soros is back in Kiev to discuss the country’s economic reconstruction. Soros met top government officials to talk about fighting corruption as Ukraine faces an acute economic crisis, and could be on the verge of a debt default. Soros held a meeting with Ukraine Parliament members Monday to
  talk about the effectiveness of the fight against corruption and
  other issues. The financier and philanthropist is reportedly staying at a
  five-star hotel in the capital, but many details of the visit
  have been kept confidential. George#Sorosto meet

    12, 2015 At the meeting with Soros the parliament members discussed the
  idea of creating a foreign direct investment fund in Ukraine to
  prop up the country’s ailing economy. The group also discussed
  who will be the chair of the Anti-Corruption Bureau. READ MORE: Ukraine in ‘full-blown financial
  crisis’ – National Bank head ""Next week will be busy with the visits of foreign guests,

  parliamentary committee on foreign affairs Anna Gopko wrote on
  her Facebook page ahead of Soros’ arrival on Monday. PACE
  President Anne Brasseur will also be present at the talks. George Soros published anarticlein the New York Review of Books on
  January 7th, calling on Europe and the West to put together a $50
  billion rescue package for the “new” Ukraine, upping his October
  suggestion of $20 billion. The $50 billion package, dubbed the Ukraine ‘Marshall Plan’,
  suggests taking money from unused rescue funds for other EU
  countries and from the IMF, the European Investment Bank, the
  World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
  Development, as well as other sources. The US helped financially
  to rebuild Europe after World War II with the original Marshall
  Plan. The new so-called ‘Marshall Plan’ focuses on supporting Ukraine,
  and not weakening Russia as the two economies are closely tied. It’s far more important to focus on how to support and
    strengthen Ukraine than how to weaken and sanction Russia. — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt)January
    13, 2015 The new government in Kiev has already secured a $17 billion aid
  package from the International Monetary Fund, but only the first
  two tranches totaling $4.6 billion has been sent, since the
  government has been slow to enact economic and political reforms,
  as well as set a budget. The IMF, whichresumeswork in Kiev this week, previouslysaidUkraine may require an additional $15 billion in aid. READ MORE:

  To date, Europe’s largest economy has only guaranteed a €500

  regions, not to pay off the country’s massive debt. The European
  Commission has put forward a €1.8 billion loan, but still awaits
  approval from the European Parliament. Soros, born György Schwartz in Hungary, fled in the 1940s for the
  UK and later became an American citizen. The finance guru has
  been involved in Ukrainian affairs since 1989. Two years before
  the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine’s first independent
  election, Soros founded the Ukrainian International Renaissance
  Foundation (IRF), which has provided more than $100 million to
  Ukrainian NGOs. Several non-governmental organizations in Ukraine that aided the
  EuroMaidan movement that helped toppled the Yanukovich government
  last February and that advocate closer ties to the EU are tied to
  Soros. Soros is the 30th richest person in the world, according to
  Forbes’ ranking, and had a personal fortune of $19 billion as of
  March 2013. The billionaire also made a name for himself as the ""man who
  broke the bank of England"" by engaging in questionable Forex
  hedging, betting against sterling, made him more than $1 billion
  in one day in September 1992. Some speculate that Soros has been
  the beneficiary of insider trader information while making
  investments. In 2002 a Paris court found Soros guilty of using
  inside information to profit from a 1988 takeover stock deal for

"31 Oct, 2014",‘Moscow ends up at risk with Ukraine gas agreement’,"It is not clear what Moscow gets out of a deal with Ukraine by selling gas below market price, and guaranteeing supplies to Europe while there are still sanctions and anti-Russian propaganda, Paul Roberts, former Assistant US Treasury Secretary, told RT. RT:How important is thisdealfor Ukraine and Europe? Paul Roberts: It is not clear what the Russian government gets
  out of it. They have agreed to sell gas to Ukraine at a
  subsidized price, far below the market price. And yet Ukraine
  continues to carry on propaganda against Russia, continues to
  attack the Russian population in eastern and southern Ukraine. Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
    EU-Russia-Ukraine gas agreement: “I don’t think [the IMF] had
    any choice. They didn’t want to get down this road. But the
    alternative would have been absolutely awful: it would have
    been large parts of Europe without gas come the middle of
    winter, and that would have been utter and complete disaster. “ RT:But getting away from those attacks how
  significant is this deal for Europe and for Ukraine, did they
  walk away winners in this? PR:Of course Europe and Ukraine walks away and
  Russia is a loser. Here you have Russia subsidizing the countries
  that are imposing sanctions on it, trying to destroy Russia. RT:Some experts say that Russia is a winner
  in this situation? Do you agree with that? Is this a good price
  for gas? PR:Why is a hundred dollars below the market
  price a good price? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
  Russia will ever be paid. If they are not going to be paid, what
  are they going to do? They are going to cut off the gas in the
  middle of the winter so that Washington propaganda can say:“Look at these evil Russians, they are starving, freezing
  Ukrainians, the gas is cut off!”I don’t think Russians
  understand what they are dealing with. Washington is far more
  devious and sophisticated then Russia can comprehend. This is not
  that Russia has a chance. Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
    EU-Russia-Ukraine gas agreement: “Ukraine is broken largely
    because the EU broke it through the policies it has followed
    over the last year, and now Europe has to pay for that… I don’t
    think financially they are very happy about it, but
    realistically, what choice did they have.” RT:But it is not Ukraine that is going to
  pay this money to Russia. The EU and IMF have said they're ready
  to finance Kiev's debt to Russia. But the Ukrainian economy is in
  tatters. Can they expect to get the money back? PR:If the IMF pays the Ukrainian bills it takes
  it back out of Ukraine. This is not a gift to Ukraine. If the
  Ukrainian economy blows up - which is likely to be the case – the
  IMF sees it is not going to be paid because Ukraine can’t pay.
  Russians won’t be paying. RT:Russia is having economic problems of
  its own. Is this agreement a positive step for Moscow too? PR:I think Moscow ends up at risk with this
  agreement. Washington is very interested in doing all the damage
  it possibly can to Russia because Russia is a potential check on
  Washington’s hegemony over the world. So for all the prices
  falling is good as far as Washington is concerned. I think it is
  foolish for the Russians to let their currency be traded at
  foreign exchange markets because Washington can attack the ruble
  and the exchange markets and drive it down. Just as George Soros
  did. One person was able to destroy the British pound. Washington
  can easily destroy the ruble. I still don’t think Russians
  understand what they are up against; they are not really in the
  game. Vladimir Putin is a good leader and he gives good speeches,
  but he doesn't seem to be able to prevent the continuing assaults
  on Russia. Despite giving Ukraine a subsidized gas price, despite
  Russia guaranteeing energy supplies to Europe in the winter,
  there is no reduction in sanctions, there is no stop in the
  propaganda against Russia. In fact the propaganda has increased
  because Washington is afraid that Russia might gain some
  advantage from treating Ukraine in such a kind way. What is
  Russia gaining out of this? It is not getting anything. Here is
  Russia with a power to turn energy off in Europe. It doesn’t use
  it, it doesn’t say to these countries in Europe:“Look, if
  you are going to put sanctions on us, if you are not going to
  have an independent foreign policy, if you are going to follow
  Washington’s orders - we don’t sell gas to NATO members.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev-controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta's desperate quest for legitimacy. Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military ‘final solution’ for the east. In 2001, the Austrian
  economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled‘Democracy:
  The God that Failed’, in which he – among other things –
  compared the process of voting to a religious ritual. Just as the
  ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
  ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
  kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity. In his
  study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
  monarchies actually safeguarded peoples' lives and liberty far
  more than democracy has – before making a case for outright
  anarchy. Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
  democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
  home. Western leaders routinely speak of‘democracy’as a
  virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as“rooted in the sanctity of the individual”(BH Obama in
  Talinn, September 2014). In actuality, democracy is simply a
  decision-making process in which the majority gets its way. The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they‘liberate’, however, democracy means whatever the
  ‘liberators’ say it means. Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
  independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not ‘democratic’ –
  because the High Priesthood in the West says so – while the
  violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was“midwifed”by Washington (per V Nuland's famous phone
  call). Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
  junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
  against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem. Its prime
  minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
  Americans (“Yats is our guy,”to quote Nuland again).
  Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
  presidential vote in May. By the time it was held, Donetsk and
  Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
  their separation. Even so, the junta's Western backers proclaimed
  Petro Poroshenko – elected on May 25 – as the legitimate leader
  of Ukraine. Quite unlike the “aggressor and invader” it was
  accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
  Poroshenko launched an all-out war against the two eastern
  regions.  That war was lost. Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
  lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
  battalions such as‘Azov’have terrorized any civilians
  they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
  have failed. Hence all the crying about‘Russian
  invasion’to the Western press, but also the coming general
  election. That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
  sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
  they are‘democratic’, and thus worth backing. More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
  nine months, this weekend's vote will showcase the absurdity of‘democracy’as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic.
  What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
  procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
  up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
  acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
  between the Nationalist-Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
  boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko. And with
  every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis –
  not the ‘neo’ variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind –
  that triangle keeps getting smaller. Recent polls - by the Western-funded Democratic Initiatives
  Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post – suggest a significant
  lead for President Poroshenko's party, followed by Lyashko's
  Radicals and Yatsenyuk's People's Front. Meanwhile, the
  formerly-ruling Party of Regions and the Communists –
  intimidated, brutalized and all-but-banned – are polling in
  single digits. However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
  they were“undecided”, which suggests they are either
  afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven't yet decided on the
  lesser of evils. Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
  under Kiev's control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
  their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
  Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open
  for business. But the‘liberators’themselves won't get
  to vote; for whatever reason, the junta's legislature failed to
  pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front. Meanwhile, the‘civil society’organizations funded for
  years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy
  lists OPORA as one of its aid recipients in 2009) to create
  fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
  violations of campaign rules. Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
  already reported over“527 violations, including at least 80
  cases of alleged voter bribery.”They either haven't got the
  memo about how this election should be a showcase of ‘democratic’
  Ukraine versus the‘authoritarian’Russia, or they did
  get the memo, and are significantly under-reporting voter
  intimidation and manipulation.  For their part, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics are refusing to
  go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
  November 7. They may not have a chance to hold them. There isn't
  much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
  artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by. A
  renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
  idea, but the junta's generals have certainly demonstrated
  greater stupidity over the course of the campaign. When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several
  Serb-majority areas refused to accept Zagreb's rule. The Croatian
  government, backed by Germany, initially failed to conquer these
  areas, and accepted a UN-guaranteed armistice (Vance Plan). Four
  years later, backed by the US, Zagreb launched an all-out assault
  and‘reintegrated’the territories by force, expelling
  some 200,000 Serbs that lived there. Poroshenko's adviser Yury
  Lutsenko openly stated back in September that Kiev ought to
  follow Croatia's example in regard to the Donbass. The‘democratic’West said nothing. After all, what
  Croatia did was a ‘democracy’ too. Because in the eyes of Western
  governments, the word means whatever they say it means, nothing
  more and nothing less. To borrow from Lewis Carrol's description
  of logic in ‘Behind the Looking Glass’,“The question is
  merely which is to be master – that's all.” Nebojsa Malic for RT Nebojsa Malic is a foreign

"22 Sep, 2014",​‘Obamastein’ is no Machiavelli,"President Obama seems poised to declare war on the world. American policy in 2014 has taken on a “zombie-like” feverishness aimed at war. Terror has been turned into a horror gag reel these days, as Washington acts out some fetish for chaos in our world. And for those who
  consider Obama a Machiavellian genius, this requires a massive
  intellect. A
  modern day political Frankenstein seems more apt. President Obama seems
  poised to declare war on the world. American policy in 2014 has
  taken on a“zombie-like”feverishness aimed at war.
  Terror has been turned into a horror gag reel these days, as
  Washington acts out some fetish for chaos in our world. And for
  those who consider Obama a Machiavellian genius, this requires a
  massive intellect. A modern day political Frankenstein seems more
  apt. America has armed and sponsored Israel so they can butcher
  Palestinian civilians. We’re prodding NATO moves in Ukraine,
  right on Russia’s doorstep. We’ve fueled a fetish to unseat
  Syria’s Assad, and to perpetuate the Iraq war, maybe forever.
  Yes, Washington’s gone totally biblical, and not in a good way. Meanwhile, we sit on our couches in Omaha or Orlando, reading the
  morning news served up to strike fear and loathing. A thousand
  authors, conjure for you, images of Russian bears devouring
  Europe, of gleaming scimitars slicing the air, and a rerun of
  those twin towers plummeting, down, down, down. But this is a
  time of WikiLeaks, the NSA spies, lies, deceit, and misdirect.
  You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
  blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
  brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
  greed, graft, and mediocre leaders. The fact is ISIS, the Arab
  Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
  Washington policy under Obama. This cannot be repudiated, but it
  can be reasoned. In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr. Ahmed Bensaada
  assembles a body of evidence that the so-called Arab Spring was a
  destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
  the US State Department and historically CIA-funded foundations
  for so-called freedom. No, you c1985annot use the“he’s one
  of them”excuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
  Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
  Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
  Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
  Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
  reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
  Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
  Development (USAID) — and George Soros’ Open Society Institute
  (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce. Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
  that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary. The hierarchy
  and system behind him might be the anti-Christ. As proof the“system”of thought in the west it corrupted, let’s look
  at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment. McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
  industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime’s Senatorial
  superhero. While some of us would like to classify his brand of
  Neo-conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
  presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
  witness to systematic abuses. Case in point, McCain is head of an
  organization known as the International Republican Institute
  (IRI). That institution’s stated goal is to;“advance
  democracy worldwide”– but the“how,”the spread,
  and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us. The
  good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
  analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
  Department. Recently IRI worked with the U.S. – Middle East Partnership
  Initiative (MEPI). The point here is, in many instances where
  Arab Spring or seeming anti-Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
  organizations like McCain’s IRI are somehow present. This quote
  from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: “MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute’s
  (IRI) “Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership” project.
  This project supports independent democratic political activists
  and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
  dialogue. IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
  Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
  research to key partners, stakeholders, civil society
  representatives and influential decision makers.” But still further inside American geo-strategizing, the
  aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
  utter decay of thinking. Thisreportentitled,“On Strategic
  Non-Violent Change,”by one of the world’s leading
  insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
  blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
  corporations. Helvey’s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
  into insurrectionists are well known. But his recent coming out
  over Ukraine’s recent“coup d’état,”this is lesser
  known. Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
  wrong is with us. While most of us know we love peace, the rest
  of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
  killers. It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
  guide for a kind of governing. This guide has been in practice in
  Washington for some decades now. Much has been written about
  Machiavelli’s“The Prince,”but this quote reveals the
  essence of Machiavellian intent: “The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
  world consists chiefly of the vulgar.”- Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
  belief. Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
  Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
  by untimely anti-Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
  from the west.Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
  Peace and Prosperity calls the West’s subversion of the Ukraine
  peace process by NATO a“grand deception.”But beyond
  just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
  of editorials for peace. There simply is no“anti-war”sentiment, not in the press. To sum up here, you don’t have to have a PhD in political science
  to understand Machiavellian intentions. The Italian philosopher
  outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
  congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a“prince”or dictator. Power, as such, was outlined as
  ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise.
  The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
  mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
  makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
  us today. Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
  of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize. The continual
  stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
  Machiavelli’s principles, as do Obama’s grand schemes for health
  care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare. In a
  nutshell, Obama’s advisers are political scientists of the first
  order. To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey’s Einstein Institute piece
  again; “A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
  obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
  public.” Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
  huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli. London, Berlin and
  Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
  reason. But in studying Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
  you’ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
  practice the kingly game. What’s important for us all is the
  purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism. Has America
  acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
  intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
  leave to you. As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
  Shelley’s modern Prometheus is upon us. We have this passage from
  Frankenstein: “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
  make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can
  scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not
  believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the
  other.” Phillip Butler

Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia. He has written for RT since 2014. Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail. Follow him on Twitter@27khv The Parliamentaryelectionsin Sweden, which took place on
  September 14, signaled the return of a left-leaning government
  after eight years in opposition. The change of government in
  Sweden also means an end of the mandate of one of the well-known
  lawmakers in the European political arena - Foreign Minister Carl
  Bildt. Bildt has been a fierce critic of Russia over its politics
  in Ukraine. RT:Bildt was one of the people behind the
  Eastern partnership - the initiative governing the EU's relations
  with post-soviet states. Some argue, this policy is partly to
  blame for the current chaos in Ukraine, would you agree? Bryan MacDonald:It definitely played a large
  part, but it wouldn’t exclusively have led to this of course.
  There are other factors such as Ukrainian internal politics,
  movements and of course interference of the US, NATO and
  non-government bodies such as George Soros and Pierre Omidyar.
  But certainly the Eastern Partnership is one of the bulwarks, and
  of course Carl Bildt was one of the main supporters of it. A
  partnership that has completely transformed the EU from a core
  group of 15 relatively rich West European countries to a group of
  27 where most of the group are poor. RT:He served on the Board of Directors of
  Lundin Oil, during the Civil war in Sudan. The company was
  accused of providing resources to government forces that
  committed crimes against humanity. How did that affect his
  reputation in Sweden? BM:I don’t think people in Europe are really
  aware of that. I think Bildt in Europe was mainly famous for his
  behavior in the Balkans and Ukraine this year, and his general
  support of what we call“eurocratic”politics, which is
  where the elite within Europe, every country almost, with a few
  exceptions of course, seem to care more about the European
  project then the actual people who live in Europe at the moment.
  That is one of the reasons he has been in the news here, I don’t
  think Sudan is such a big issue in Europe itself amongst the
  normal voting public. RT:Bildt worked with the Committee for the
  liberation of Iraq pushing for the invasion of the country. How
  big of a role did the organization play in the conflict? BM:Again, like with the Ukraine situation, it’s
  one of many groups that played a role in conflict. Obviously the
  biggest role in the conflict was played by George Bush and Tony
  Blair by their bombing of Iraq. Of course it played a role and
  Bildt is a notorious neo-con, but the real question here is that
  Bildt is a slavish supporter of what we call American values
  which are not necessarily in train with what we call European
  values. Most Europeans, not all, but especially countries like
  France, in the Nordic countries and Ireland, would be suspicious
  of America’s actions and would have a very different world view
  to the US. Bildt is not; Bildt is for whatever reason, maybe his
  personal self-benefit or general ideology, 100 percent supports
  American policies without almost any question. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"12 Aug, 2014",​Sovereign debt for territory: A new global elite swap strategy,"In recent decades, dozens of sovereign nations have fallen into ever-deepening trouble by becoming indebted with the “private megabank over-world” for amounts far, far in excess of what they can ever pay back.

Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including ‘The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope’), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator.He writes op-ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America.Adrian currently hosts his TV show ‘Segunda República’ on Channel TLV1 – Toda La Verdad Primero – in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda República), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere.His website is:www.asalbuchi.com.ar;YouTube channel:www.youtube.com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant.

  government mismanagement on a truly grand scale? Or are we seeing
  global power elite long-term planners slowly achieving their
  goals? Recurrent sovereign debt crises reflect neither“over-lending
  mistakes”by bankers and investors, nor“innocence”on the part of successive governments in deeply indebted nations. Rather, it all ties in with a global model for domination driven
  by a system of perpetual national debt which Ihave called“The Shylock Model”. As with the tango which requires rhythm and bravado, Argentina is
  again dancing centre-stage to global mega-bankers’ financial
  tunes after falling into a new“technical default”. Not
  just because the country is unable to pay off its massive public
  debt by heeding the“rules of the game”as written and
  continuously re-vamped by global usurers, but now with added
  legal immorality and judicial indecency on the part of New York’s
  Second District Manhattan Court presided by Judge Daniel Griesa. Griesa has shown no qualms in putting US law at the service of
  immoral parasitic“bankers and investors”such as Paul
  Singer of the Elliott/NML Fund and Mark Brodsky of the Aurelius
  Fund. The mainstream media inside and outside Argentina refer to these
  parasitic money“sloshers”as“vulture funds”;
  a conceptual mistake because one might then be led to believe
  that other funds and bankers - Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citigroup,
  JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, George Soros, Rothschild, Warburg
  - are not“vultures”when, in fact, the very foundations
  of today’s global banking system lie on parasitic pro-vulture
  rules and laws coupled with an overpowering lack of moral values.  Sovereign debts are a major problem in just about every country
  in the world, including the US, UK and EU nations. So much so,
  those debts have become a Damocles’ Swords threatening the
  livelihood of untold billions of workers around the world. One often wonders why governments indebt themselves for so much
  more than they can ever hope to pay… Here, Western economists,
  bankers, traders, Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel
  laureates and the mainstream media have a quick and monolithic
  reply: because all nations need“investment and
  investors”if they wish to build highways, power plants,
  schools, airports, hospitals, raise armies, service
  infrastructures and a long list of et ceteras, economic and
  national activities are all about. But more and more people are starting to ask a fundamental
  common-sense question: why should governments indebt themselves
  in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
  mega-bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
  and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their
  own local sovereign currency instead? Here is where all the above“experts”go berserk &
  ballistic, shouting back:“Issue currency? Are you crazy??
  That’s against the “rules & laws” of economics!!! Issuing
  national sovereign currency to finance the real economy’s
  monetary needs leads to inflation and lost jobs and chaos and…
  (puts us nice mega-bankers out of a job…)!!.”That’s when
  they all gang-up into noisy“The sky is falling! The sky is
  falling!!”mode. Then you ask them: What happens when countries default on their
  unpayable sovereign debts - as they invariably and repeatedly do
  - not just in Argentina, but in Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, France,
  Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Portugal, Russia, Bolivia,
  Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and
  Indonesia? Again the voice of the“experts”:“Then countries
  must “restructure” their debts kicking them forwards 20, 40 or
  more years into the future, so that your great, great, great
  grandchildren can continue paying them”. Oh, I see! The truth is that countries need public spending to maintain
  their economies resilient and buoyant, their citizens working,
  prospering and happy; their nation-states sovereign, strong and
  secure. OK: happy, secure and working populations cannot be defined as a
  formula that can be readily integrated into“expert”economists’ spreadsheets. However, there’s a basic truth that
  should be obvious by now: Finance (which is the virtual world of
  bankers, investments, speculation and usury) should always be
  fully subordinated to the Real Economy (which is the world of
  work, production, buildings, milk & bread and services). All this begs the obvious question: Since governments have a
  natural tendency to overspend and end up getting themselves into
  too much debt, which is the better option then: - that their“red numbers”(aka sovereign debt) should
  be owed to themselves; their own nation-states (debt in local
  currency that in the last instance can be written off, even if a
  bad bout of inflation cannot be stopped, countries can always
  revamp their currencies as Argentina repeatedly did over the past
  forty years), whereby the whole“debt crisis”basically
  becomes a short-term internal affair (albeit painful!), or… - to convert those“red numbers”into foreign currency
  debt (US Dollars or Euro) fully controlled by powerful far-away,
  well-organized creditor-technocrats and global mega-bankers
  sitting at the FED and IMF in Washington DC; the European Central
  Bank in Frankfurt; or perched in eager expectation in their Wall
  Street vulture nests? This tongue-twister, which famously proved too much for Baby Bush
  to muster, is a fitting description of how the hellish sovereign
  debt system really works in the long-term. Argentina’s recurrent defaults and debt restructuring go back
  many decades. For brevity’s sake, let’s just point to 1956 right
  after President Juan Domingo Perón was ousted by a very bloody
  1955 US-UK (and mega-banker) sponsored military coup.  Perón was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina
  with the mega-bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining the
  International Monetary Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all
  of Argentina’s sovereign debt. So, once the mega-bankers got rid
  of him in 1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created
  the“Paris Club”to engineer decades-worth of sovereign
  debt for vanquished Argentina, something they’ve been doing until
  today. But each sovereign-debt crisis cycle became shorter, more
  virulent and more toxic. By December 2001, Argentina had collapsed financially sinking
  into the largest sovereign debt default in history. Immediately,
  the IMF’s deputy manager Anne Krueger proposed some“new and
  creative ideas”on what to do about Argentina. She published them in 2002 in an article on the IMF’s website:“Should Countries like Argentina be able to declare
  themselves bankrupt?”, in which she said that“the
  lesson is clear: we need better incentives to bring debtors and
  creditors together before manageable problems turn into
  full-blown crises”, adding that the IMF believes“this
  could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy regimes like
  Chapter 11 in the US”. She pointed this out as“a possible new approach”,
  adding that“of course many practical and political obstacles
  to getting such an approach up and running”needed to be
  overcome, the“key features would need the force of law
  throughout the world”, creating“a predictable (global)
  legal framework”. From the stance of global mega-bankers’ geopolitical long-term
  planners, Ms Krueger’s proposal consisted of first gradually
  driving countries into receivership, and then sequentially into
  full-fledged bankruptcy. Then as if nations were private corporations like Enron or
  WorldCom - they could be broken up into as many“digestible”pieces as possible, to be gobbled up by
  international creditors in some global vulture-fest banquet. These ideas were developed in greater detail in her IMF essay,“A New Approach to Debt Restructuring”, and in a“Foreign Affairs”(mouthpiece of the powerful New
  York-Based Elite think-tank, Council on Foreign Relations)
  article published in July/August 2002 by Harvard professor
  Richard N Cooper:“Chapter 11 for Countries”. Here, Cooper very matter-of-factly recommends that“only if
  the debtor nation cannot restore its financial health are its
  assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed to its creditors –
  again under the guidance of a (global) court”(!). During those turbulent years, the global press – Time and The New
  York Times, for example – even suggested that the immensely rich
  Patagonia southern region should secede from Argentina as a
  defaulted debt payment mechanism. In June 2005, however, a new sovereign debt bond mega-swap was
  instrumented by Argentina’s new president, Nestor Kirchner, and
  his Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna. However, as Argentina became more and more structurally mired in
  debt, its sovereign debt crisis cycle grew shorter and shorter so
  that by 2010 a new debt crisis was in the books involving yet
  more debt reengineering, this time by President Cristina Kirchner
  and her Economy Minister (and today prosecuted Vice President)
  Amado Boudou. But that too failed to hold for long, and today Singer’s
  NML/Elliot Fund and Brodsky’s Aurelius Fund have pushed Argentina
  again into default, this time with the legal backing of local
  Manhattan Federal Judge Griesa and the US Supreme Court. The very fact that today the fate of Argentina’s sovereign debt
  lies with the US Judiciary is an eloquent sign of things to come. Surprisingly, Ms Krueger recently came out in“defense”of Argentina recommending Judge Griesa and his“Vulture
  Nest”boys should not act hastily killing off the Argentine
  hen that lays golden eggs. In an article published July 2014, she warns that the“US
  Supreme Court’s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle, and may
  very well further increase the risk attached to holding sovereign
  debt and this, to the cost of issuing it.” The specialized and mainstream media - Financial Times, New York
  Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist - are also recommending
  Judge Griesa and his vulture chicks to show more restraint
  because in today’s delicate post-2008 banking system, a new and
  less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart the global
  elite’s plans for an“orderly transition towards a new global
  legal architecture”that will allow orderly liquidation of
  financially-failed states like Argentina. Especially if such debt
  were to be collateralized by its national territory (what else is
  left!?) Will yet another sovereign debt bond mega-swap be imposed upon
  Argentina, this time with large swathes of its national territory
  – especially Patagonia – being used as collateral guarantee? That would mean that in a few years’ time the Shylocks in Wall
  Street and London will do everything they can to yet again push
  Argentina into default, since that would pave the way for them to“legally”take over its territory cashing in on their
  collateral as“compensation”. Remember: usurer Shylock drooled at the mouth whilst sharpening
  his knife preparing to cut deep into Merchant Antonio’s heart. He
  didn’t give a damn about the 3000 ducats owed him: he just wanted
  the pound of flesh“legally”his. Is this what the coming“Sovereign Debt Model”will look
  like? If we tie this all in with what the unfolding of“Act
  III”in the on-goingIsrael-Palestine crisiswhereby re-settling
  millions of Israeli civilians into southern Argentina might be on
  the drawing board, we can then begin to understand how nicely
  Argentina’s next debt crisis will tie in: The global
  Rothschild’s, Warburg’s, Lazard’s, Soros, Rockefellers will be
  able to“legally”take over Patagonia, and then“legally”hand it over to whomever they wish without a
  single shot being fired! If this is what’s really happening behind-the-curtains regarding
  Argentina, does anybody believe it will stop there? Beware Greece, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Korea,
  Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa – the world government is
  marching in! The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to ‘voluntarily commit suicide’,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT’s Truthseeker. RT:Could you
  summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
  IMF loans, to Ukraine's best assets ending up in private Western
  hands - the IMF's 'knee-breaker' role as you memorably described
  it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
  mind is that finance today is war by non-military means. The aim
  of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
  ending up with its property. The main property to obtain is that
  which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange. For
  Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
  companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
  oligarchs. For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
  these assets and their revenue into foreign hands – in an economy
  whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
  of the failed post-1991 restructuring. That is where the IMF
  comes in. The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
  deficits. Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
  mainly to maintain a country’s exchange rate. The effect usually
  is to subsidize flight capital out of the country – at a high
  exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
  dollars or euro. In Ukraine’s case, foreign creditors would
  include Gazprom, which already has been paid something. The IMF
  transfers a credit to its“Ukraine account,”which then
  pays foreign creditors. The money never really gets to Ukraine or
  to other IMF borrowers. It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
  including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
  Greece. Such loans come with“conditionalities”that
  impose austerity. This in turn drives the economy even further
  into debt – forcing the government to tighten the budget even
  more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
  assets. RT:Can Ukraine expect the so-called'IMF
  effect'of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
  to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
  to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants’
  remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP. (About $10 billion a
  year.) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
  Western Europe. The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
  more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work. They will send
  some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
  Ukrainian currency vis-à-vis the ruble and euro. RT:How are the IMF's tools in reality
  “weapons of mass destruction” as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
  austerity and unemployment. The result is a downward economic
  spiral. Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues. So governments are
  told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets –
  mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
  extract economic rent. The effect is to turn the economy into a
  renting“tollbooth economy.”Hitherto free public roads
  are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
  sewer systems also are privatized. This raises the cost of
  living, and hence the cost of labor – while overall wage levels
  are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
  raises unemployment. RT:The IMF's perhaps also a weapon of mass
  destruction in a more literal sense. The organization has
  publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
  're-design' its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
  Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting.
  Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
  instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF’s“conditionality”is that
  it“pacify”the East. Pacification may occur violently
  in today’s Orwellian rhetoric. The only way in which actual
  political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
  federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
  kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West. As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
  the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
  prosecuted the IMF. All that voters can do is reject governments
  submitting to IMF conditionalities. Many voters who are able will“vote with their feet”and simply leave the sinking
  economy. So the IMF’s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
  are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered.
  Austerity is ultimately a policy – nobody is holding gun to their
  head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
  in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it. In this
  sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago.  RT:Everyone knows austerity's effects on
  Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don't want it;
  even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn't work. Why will
  Ukraine's leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
  job in the West when they've voted out or something? MH:Ukraine’s leaders are mainly kleptocrats.
  Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
  their own power. George Soros has written that their best way to
  do this is to find Western partners. This will provide US and
  European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
  economy. Western support will provide more IMF and European
  lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
  can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
  banks. RT:Do you think that the EU isn't stupid
  enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one-sided
  association agreement, member states will just strip the country
  of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
  Ukraine's 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
  member. One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
  German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Ukraine has rich Western land,
  and that part of the country is largely still rural. Foreign
  investors would like to buy it out and“re-feudalize”it, creating large business farms. But the EU is unlikely to
  provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
  investment in Western European agriculture. The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
  benefit from its inexpensive labor. Wrecking the economy
  Greek-style or Irish-style or Latvian-style is sufficient to send
  its workers to the West. And the most mobile traditionally are
  the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
  languages and with skills in demand in the West. RT:You noted Ukraine 'must have asked the
  US first' before blowing up that gas pipeline. Do you think NATO
  will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
  less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
  waging a big PR campaign in Europe. MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
  economy much more high-cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
  in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange. The NATO
  rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
  Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine“won’t continue
  subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
  Russia can arm itself against us [with this money].” The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
  manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
  defend itself. And without purchasing foreign technology and
  without large state subsidy – as US and European governments
  provide their own economies – Russia cannot create a
  manufacturing economy. So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
  earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
  that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
  military power my potentially be used to achieve political
  independence from the US sphere. RT:Anything else you would like to
  add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
  throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
  power of elected governments, and hence of democracy. Governments
  are sovereign. No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
  or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
  state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
  war. At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
  financial oligarchy, or elected governments. The two sets of aims
  are antithetical: rising living standards and national
  independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international
  dependency. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"20 Jun, 2014",Intl Energy Forum head - EU's energy independence dreams won't be realized anytime soon,"Ukraine is refusing to pay its energy bills, and Moscow turns off the taps – there is now a real concern another gas war is going on, and it may get out of hand. The game for energy has too many players locked in it – Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and the US – but who will suffer the consequences if things go wrong and the agreement is not reached? Can shale gas save the day? We ask these questions to the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. Aldo Flores-Quiroga is on Sophie&Co today. Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Aldo Flores-Quiroga, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, welcome to the show. It’s great to have you with us. I’m going to start from the latest: Europe wants energy independence – what do you think, can it ever achieve that goal when it has no significant natural energy reserves of its own? Is it something doable? Aldo Flores-Quiroga:Energy independence as a concept on its own is a very weak concept for pursuing energy policy. No country is energy independent, and it’s very unlikely that anyone can achieve that. The world of energy is one of interdependence, it’s a message we constantly emphasize in the context of producer-consumer dialog conducted under the IEF. SS:You know how Europe is dependent on Russian gas – it seems something of a cliché. Is it really Russia or the transit countries that is causing the problems? I mean, Russia is a reliable supplier; it has never halted the flow of gas to Europe. It only had to reroute the gas when Ukraine would stop the transit… AFQ:Look, this goes beyond whether countries are causing or not problems. The structure of long-term, safe, reliable trade between countries requires a commitment of many players. In the energy dialogue we have learned that security of demand is as important as security of supply. And what we’re seeing now in the context of Russian-European trade and Ukraine as a transit country is a responsible behavior from all sides. There’s conversation going on, which is the right approach when there is a divergence of views, and we welcome this very much. Of course issue is not simple, but to the extent that the interested parties are participating in this dialog, it should be welcomed by everyone. SS::OK, but now we have a special situation on our hands. There is a civil war going on in Ukraine. Russia is Europe’s biggest gas supplier. Now half of the gas flow to Europe is passing through Ukraine. Is it safe for Europe’s supply right now? AFQ:Is it safe for Europe’s supply right now? SS:Yeah, because, you know, it’s an unusual situation right now in Ukraine. It’s beyond just being a safe supplier or safe transit route, there is a civil war going on in the country. AFQ:Again, the fundamental component of any country’s energy policy involves diversification. Suppliers and demanders, producers and consumers always have to have diversification as one of the objectives of energy policy if they want to enhance the energy security. The fact that European countries have pursued a policy of diversification, the fact that Russia itself is pursuing a policy of diversification, both of energy sources and of markets: it’s just a sensible policy regardless of the circumstances. SS:But if we talk in terms of today, not in one year or two or three years, but, like, today – the way things are looking right now, remembering 2006 and 2009 Ukraine was late with its gas payments and intercepted Europe-bound Russian gas. Could that happen again right now? AFQ:The first thing to keep in mind is that we’re in a different world right now from 2009. Europe has made investments in diversification, Russia has also approached this with a mindset of diversification, investments that it has done to go with Europe now are looking towards markets in the East, and there is also a stronger political infrastructure, to call it somehow, to address this issue, so… we’re not exactly facing the same situation. And investments in diversification involved not only the inter-connectedness in Europe, but new markets – Europe is set to increase its energy imports, as we have also seen. Russia, as I have said, is looking for markets elsewhere – and this should strengthen the energy security for all interested parties. SS:OK, but talking of diversification, you would think that the South Stream pipeline project would have taken care of many things – it would be so beneficial to Europe; but then you see Bulgaria all of a sudden halting its construction. What do you think happened there? What went wrong? AFQ:As usual in this cases, it is never simple to bring all the various interests to coincide. That’s why investments in gas are long-term – usually they take a sometimes protracted negotiation process, and what we’re seeing is precisely that. It’s not necessarily easy to bring this many countries and companies to agree on what is a best approach to these very sizeable investments. SS:Look, I’m not insinuating anything… AFQ:Now, that said, it is of course important that there’s a responsible behavior from all sides, producers consumers and transit countries, and, well, the fact that there are complications, does not imply that there is an irresponsible behavior per se. There are just various points of view that have to be made compatible in the process of these negotiations. SS:And every country has the right to decide on its own whether they want to be part of a pipeline project, or not. But if Russian gas was no longer available, what alternatives are there? For example, Norway’s Statoil announced it could increase gas supplies to the European Union, but it just wouldn’t be enough in terms of quantity to make up for all of the Russian gas. So, what are the alternatives as of today? AFQ:First of all, I would not start from that premise. I don’t think that the Russian gas will not be available. Second, let’s keep in mind that gas consumption as such of total energy consumption in Europe is 5 percent. This means that Europe is diversified and has options, and together with new measures that are being taken in Europe, approaches to diversify – like I have said – their energy needs and their sources of gas supply, I don’t see a scenario of any major disruption and I do see that Europe has many options on the table to deal with any situation. Europe has a diversified energy system, even taking into account that Russia is such an important gas supplier to Europe. SS:And can the US make up any shortfall in energy supplies for Europe? AFQ:Well, that’s a question that everyone is asking, what’s going to be the impact of the “unconventionals revolution” as it is now called, the rise of production of gas in the US, of oil and gas in the rest of the world, and gas markets in general. We have yet to see many other developments unfold before we can say with any certainty how it’s going to happen. Right now, the main project is for LNG export in the US from the Gulf coast. It appears to be dedicated to supply both Asia and Europe, but it is just one of many projects, it may not have the size right now for anyone to suggest that this will make up for shortfalls in the supply. Again, this is a much more complex subject with many players, with many suppliers. What is clear, of course, is that to the extent that exports from the US to Europe or from any other country for that matter to Europe are sustained or increased, this will also enhance the energy security in Europe. SS:I remember European Commission president José Manuel Barroso saying that the EU can’t create the illusion that gas from the US is going to solve all of its problems, and there are so many different estimates of how much it could take, but in your personal opinion – what’s your estimate? How much time does the US need to put their shale gas export into action? AFQ:Now, that’s quite speculative. We know that there is one project approved in the US, and there are many more on different levels of probability being explored, so it is unclear. And moreover, the US is increasing its own demand for its own gas, so it is too soon to tell, in my view. SS:But you know how people like to speculate, and when we announced that we’re having you on our program, it was going to be about gas, there is this viewer of ours who sent us this question – he is asking, is there any weight to the idea that this Russian-Ukraine gas conflict is being stirred up by the US, and it is to force Europe to switch suppliers? AFQ:Well that’s just pure speculation. I certainly don’t agree with that point of view. Let me insist, there are serious issues with serious players and actors and governments and companies. The idea that with the amount of resources involved, the size of investments that are behind the oil and gas industry, and the very important relationships between states that this type of simplistic mindset would be used…anyway, it’s just hard to imagine. SS:I do want to continue talking about this whole shale gas revolution, because Europe and Ukraine have shale gas reserves, and they are untapped. Now, is the crisis situation going to advance their development – what do you think? AFQ:Well, we have seen that any disruption to energy flows does increase attention to policies of diversification, and fracking, the possibility of using hydraulic fracking to increase oil and gas production in Europe is therefore now with more emphasis on the table, and well, it’s part of the search for energy security. It is indeed one of the components of diversification, it’s not the only one, but, currently, given the issues that we have now seen, with respect to gas trade between Russia and Europe – well it becomes more interesting to see what can be done with oil and gas. SS:Well you certainly know much more about fracking than I do. So how safe a technology is it? Because, we do see a lot of anti-fracking protests worldwide, like Bulgaria and France have rejected shale gas due to the harm it poses to the environment. What do you think of it? AFQ:We have seen so far practices that seem to be compatible with environmental protection. There have been experiences that have not been positive, that are under study, that have been addressed so far. So, it seems from what we know up to this point that production from shale resources is safe enough. So far, without any instance of major disaster for the environment or major issues socially, the industry seems to be progressing well, but of course everyone should be vigilant and every effort should be made that no harm to the environment and to other civic and societal concerns is made. SS:What about, like, minor disasters, not major, but minor disasters – are they OK? Is it worth the big idea? AFQ:Well, no disaster is fine, right? None of that should be acceptable. The industry, and of course the governments should make sure that this production is done in the safest way possible, that no serious affectation is made. So, whatever type of accidents or concerns that have happened, both with production of shale, and production of unconventionals, or any other resource has to be addressed. SS:I’ve been reading up on this a little bit, and there is in Britain, in Romania and even in US locals report seismic activity in their neighborhoods, and they say their tap water catches fire – I mean, that’s seems crazy, and there’s this issue of water pollution with the chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing. Is this serious, is this big? AFQ:The evidence is not strong in that regard. We have seen claims about earthquakes associated with fracking, about water contamination. Interestingly, some of the concerns have been voiced also do involve the environment per se, but the level of traffic that is associated with the moving back and forth of trucks that are participating or are part of fracking process. But, the evidence, again, so far, is not strong to suggest that the environmental effects of fracking are adverse. SS:I want to get back to our part of the world, because this is what worries us the most. Now, the price Ukraine pays for Russian gas is $485 per 1,000 cubic meters. I just want your expert opinion, leaving the politics aside – it wants to pay half the price, is that a fair request? AFQ:This is a commercial decision between supplier and consumer. What is, I think, clear to everyone, is that the supply bringing gas and oil to market is costly, and no one can reasonably expect that production should not be compensated. Likewise, it’s not wise, from the producer side to think that taking measures that will affect consumers will be in anyone’s interest – certainly not for the long-term. So, a solution must be found that is fair to the producer and the consumer in this case. What we are seeing is a process for finding that solution, and I’m confident that it will be found. SS:What would you advise, because Ukraine is unwilling to pay for gas, Russia is unwilling to budge – what would your expect advice be in this dispute? They have kind of reached a deadlock right now… AFQ:It might be a deadlock, but it’s part, again, of the process, and in the past we have seen that these deadlocks are solved, this are positions that are not fixed through time, as conversations evolve, greaterlearning of what are their concerns and the possibilities will be available, and I’m sure there will be a solution found. To insist, producers must be compensated, without a doubt, this is not a cheap business, and consumers must also count with the certainty that they will have the energy they need. The energy, as you may recall, in the international arena is more and more regarded as a human right – and this is usually assumed or taken into account in the context of energy property; but, energy is crucial for development of every country, and the solution, to insist, will have to involve producers and consumers alike – and this is part of the job, by the way, that of course we have to promote at the IEF. SS:Yeah, but it’s quite unfortunate that this basic right is not free and cannot be free. Now, Ukraine wants to buy gas from Europe, as one of the solutions, and the deal is supposedly better than the one Russia is offering. Does Europe have enough supplies to sell extra to Kiev, and be a reliable long-term supplier, what do you think? AFQ:Well, right now, this doesn’t seem to be evident, but I don’t see why it should be a problem for any country to diversify its sources of supply, or of demand. That’s, as I’ve said in the beginning, a sensible energy policy. SS:Oh no, diversification is not a problem for anyone, I’m just saying this option of buying gas from Europe instead of Russia – is that a viable option as of today? That’s what I’m asking. AFQ:As of today – well, no. Europe needs much more interconnections, and if I understand the question correctly, it involves mainly the countries of Central or Eastern Europe, and in all that part of Europe greater infrastructure is needed for distribution of gas, and investments will have to be made. SS:Now, there is this other idea that’s been tossed around, specifically by George Soros, I think he is the one who came up with it and then everyone sort of started talking about it. It is some kind of coordinated action to bring down price of oil – do you think it is a realistic possibility, will the OPEC countries agree to lose revenues in order to follow US foreign policy goals? AFQ:Coordinated actions to manipulate prices or to move prices in particular direction are hardly useful or beneficial. What we need is markets that work better, more freely, and that are more resilient. So, the actions must be to strengthen energy markets overall, so that we have also greater energy security. But either on the supply or the demand side to try to move prices in particular directions beyond the promotion of price stability which is necessary for long-term planning and investment – I don’t think it’s in the interest of anyone, and certainly not useful for the promotion of economic growth. SS:Now Russia and America have had ideological differences over Ukraine, and the differences are quite acute at this moment – but then you see oil giants like BP and Exxon Mobil (and they actually instead of [following the] White House’s line have signed agreements with Russia’s Rosneft) – now, we’re thinking over here, don’t you find it a little silly, that they are making deals with a company whose CEO can’t even visit them or even pay for their lunch, because, he is banned from everywhere – I know it’s an absurd situation, what do you make of it? AFQ:I think that this is part of a conduct of business, and we have to look at it from a pure framework – there is what companies are doing and what states are also involved in, and we are also going to see a process of adjustment in this regard. But to qualify this as absurd – that’s your opinion, it’s not mine. SS:What’s not absurd is not the fact that companies are making deals despite of politics, the absurd [thing] is that the man who is in charge of the biggest company in Russia cannot even visit the companies who is he signing the deals with. That’s what I meant, I just wanted to be precise. Alright, thank you so much for this wonderful insight in the world of energy. We were talking to Aldo Flores-Quiroga, chief of the International Energy Forum. We were talking about how Europe and Ukraine and also Russia can diversify their energy fields. It was great talking to you. That’s it for this edition of Sophie&Co. I will see you next time.  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"26 May, 2014","​China to be the most important country in XXI century - Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment. There’s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil. So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow’s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman – Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today. Follow@SophieCo_RT SS:Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us. We’re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia – but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China. How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? JR:Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don’t like saying it, since I’m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together – America is driving Russia more and more to Asia… That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington.     SS:So you’re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? JR:Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly. As you know, they’ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn’t think through the consequences. Mr. Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that’s not so unusual – what’s unusual is that America didn’t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day-to-day basis, so now… Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia. I’m afraid America just didn’t think it through, they’ve bungled, they’ve acted on a day-to-day basis, and they’ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events. Mr. Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr. Obama. SS:You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine “another embarrassment for the US foreign policies”. Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? JR:That’s an extremely good question. Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington. I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America. You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time. Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia. SS:But if you’re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? JR:I didn’t say it’s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon. But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that’s not… that’s good for Russia, that’s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out. You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia – that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners. SS:George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy. Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? JR:America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to… I mean, if we’ve sold all of our oil reserves, it’s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market. It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even. But, then the markets it’s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn’t have anything in reserve, so… again, you have to ask him, I don’t know, but that doesn’t seem like a very viable solution to me. SS:But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there’s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe – will the US be able to fill the gap? JR:No. America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe. You don’t just sort of snap your fingers and do that. You don’t just put in on a boat or plane, you’ve got to have special ports on both sides, you’ve got to have special ships, and you’ve got to have natural gas in the right place. Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe – that’s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe. Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas - will they have a surplus in five years? I don’t know. Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it. SS:I don’t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine. Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? JR:Pay it back to the European Union? No, I doubt it very seriously. They’re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas. I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it. I don’t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back. SS:Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair?  I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? JR:Sophie, you’re asking extremely good question. I don’t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play. I don’t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game. I don’t see what America expected to get out of it. Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that… I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don’t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine. It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would. SS:But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? JR:I don’t see that it has hurt Russia. Maybe there’s something I don’t know, but I don’t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point. SS:What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia’s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk. So where does that leave dollar? JR:Again, I don’t particularly like saying this, because I’m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar… many people now must be saying“guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don’t like us, they’ve going to put sanctions on us!”So more and more people would say“maybe I shouldn’t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn’t have my money in US dollars.”At the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar. More and more people are doing the same thing, they’re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar. This is just a continuing long-term move away from the US dollar. And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions. SS:So, if you’re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? JR:The US has been the world’s reserve currency, has had the world’s medium of exchange and so far we’ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars. We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money. If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say“here they are!”– then that cripples America in many-many ways. The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view. Just recently, the space people said“every country in the world has eventually collapsed”and the way America is going, we might collapse too. This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things. If you read history, Sophie, it’s true, it’s correct. When people do not have the money that they used to have – they’re limited in many ways. You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don’t have the money to pay for it anymore, you’re in trouble. SS:You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia – why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? JR:It’s a been a long-term adage in the investment world that you buy when there’s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you’re probably going to make a lot of money in the end – unless the world comes to an end. I don’t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy. I’ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I’m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high – that’s what I’m trying to do. SS:Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that’s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now… JR:I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I’ll tell you – I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine. You don’t buy something just because it’s low – because it can get lower and lower and lower. I’d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it’s going to continue to be in turmoil. If you’ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10-15 years – you know what I’m talking about. Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now. SS:So what are you thinking – how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? JR:I would suspect that it’s going to… America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well. As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said“No, we’re not going to do this anymore, we don’t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia”. Europeans don’t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it’s doing nothing. It doesn’t hurt the Russians – doesn’t seem to. There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don’t suspect that this is going to last much longer. SS:Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you’re looking at non-energy companies. Is it right? JR: I have plenty of energy investment, so I’m not investing in energy companies in Russia. I’m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy. SS:Well, that’s what I was going to ask you – what do you invest in, in Russia? JR:I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares. I own shares of the Moscow’s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I’m looking for other areas to invest. I don’t have any others yet, but I’m looking. SS:Look, I’ve got a sense from what you’re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia. Is that’s how it works, exactly? JR:I said,“if there are more sanctions”. Washington keeps saying they’re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will. That’s what they say they’re going to do, they probably will do it. And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while. I have no idea of what’s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak. But it often does. SS:Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well-known basic strategy – but you’re not afraid for the long-term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? JR:No, of course. My point about sanctions is that they don’t seem to be hurting Russia, I don’t see that there’s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don’t go along with them, or don’t go along with them in a big way – I don’t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short-term. It’s just that I don’t see it. SS:With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? JR:Yes. I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you’ve probably know. Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren’t very viable, that they haven’t hurt Russia – in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they’re doing more business with China. China is a pretty successful economy, so it’s not hurting, and in some ways it’s actually helping Russia, because it’s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn’t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals. It’s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars. SS:Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let’s say, during your lifetime? JR:During my lifetime? SS:Yep. JR:Well, I hope I’ll live a long time, Sophie, so – yes. I hope I’ll live a long, long time. SS:Well, we hope too. But tell me one more thing: do you think there’s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? JR:Oh, I’m sure we will. If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see… I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you’ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea. I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they’re going to take advantage of it. So, no, it’s happening. SS:You have said that you’re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center – you really think it has what it takes? JR:No, what I’ve said was that I’m astonished that they think that, that they’re going to try – I don’t know if they can make that. Mr. Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center. I’m astonished. I’ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center. And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive. Whether it works or not in 10-15 years? I don’t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center. SS:Talking about 10-15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age. Is that where the future is, in China? JR:In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not. Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world. SS:Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? JR:Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more. I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing. Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life. I’ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years. I do think I see opportunities and therefore I’m investing. SS:So when did you first come to Russia? JR:I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years. I knew I wouldn’t work. But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I’ve started investing in Russia. SS:So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? JR:No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events. I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok. I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place… I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together. I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn’t as bad as it had been for 46 years. SS:I want to ask one more question about China. I’m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn’t suffered any crises yet. But, it might at some point, like all markets do – so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? JR:Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it’s going to affect some people. If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering. That’s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now. It’s just like…if America has problems; it affects a lot of people. If Japan has problems, it affects some people. So there is no question that China will have problems – I don’t know what, or when, or why – but every country has problems, somewhere along the line. What is a little bit unusual is that it’s been a long time since China has had major problems. That is extremely unusual. That’s one reason I’m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I’m waiting in case there’s a problem coming out of China. If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I’m smart enough to buy more china. SS:Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice. We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author. We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China.

"30 Mar, 2014",​Gulf toil?,"US-Saudi relations have long been grounded in an oil-for-security exchange. But with U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil diminishing and Saudi power rising, is there a growing gulf in the Gulf? Has the US spat with Russia affected this relationship, and could it lead to a change in the Syrian deadlock? Oksana is joined by Dr David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, to drill into these issues. WATCH: https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/http://www.youtube.com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart. President Obama spoke a lot about the good and bad ways of doing geopolitics this week - a rhetoric intended for European and possibly Russian ears that was all but brushed aside when he landed in Saudi Arabia. How is it that American values seem to depreciate every time the Saudis are involved? To discuss that, I'm now joined by David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Dr Weinberg, thank you very much for taking time to talk to us. David Weinberg:Thank you for having me. OB:Now, the organisation you work for was set up after 9/11 to “promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism.” Is there any country that is more antithetic to all those objectives than Saudi Arabia? DW:Sure, Syria, Iran, lots of countries. But certainly there's a big gap between the values of the US and the values of the Saudis. It's a relationship that's been strained by the conflicting values of the two sides. OB:But my question was whether Saudi Arabia really takes the cake for essentially lacking all the three elements that are mentioned in the purposes of the organisation that you work for. Again, there is not much in the way of pluralism, they don't value democracy at all, and when it comes to the ideology espoused by Saudi Arabia – not only it condones terrorism, it actually supports it. DW:Yeah, I mean look, dictatorship is not a contest, but if it were, the Saudis would be doing great. My organisation has actually been quite active on this issue. For instance, this week we put out a report highlighting the hate that is continually, still being taught in Saudi Arabia's public schools through their textbook system. So, we certainly are no friends of the Saudis on this issue, and we certainly hope that the President had some very serious conversations about human rights behind closed doors, while he was in Saudi Arabia. OB:Well this is a very mild way of putting it. But Saudi Arabia is not officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. And yet it is well known that it is the largest source of financing when it comes to militant jihadi groups such as the Taliban or Al Qaeda. And I hardly need to mention that it is Americans who suffered a great deal from the terror plots hatched, and sometimes executed with the help of Saudi money. Fifteen out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. And when you think about it, had they been Russians, I think we could have had an outbreak of World War III by now. But with the Saudis, again, it's always “let's be patient with them”. And it may be a personal question, but for a country like Russia, which often finds itself on the receiving end of US condemnation without hurting a single American, it's very difficult to understand why would Americans let the Saudis off the hook so easily, given how many Americans were hurt in 9/11? DW:Absolutely. Well, you know, I think it's reflected, first of all, in public opinion numbers. Saudi Arabia has absolutely dreadful numbers when you as the American public what they think of the other country. But when you say Saudi money going to sponsor terrorism, I'm curious whether you mean state money going to sponsor terrorism, or whether you mean private money going to sponsor terrorism? Which do you mean? OB:Well Dr Weinberg, I mean both. Because obviously, there are some private sponsors of terror groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Lebanon. They used to sponsor insurgency in Chechnya as well. But official government structures in Saudi Arabia are not the most transparent, so you can never be sure that official money is not being used for the same purpose. DW:But is there evidence of official money? I don't think so. OB:Well, I think Prince Bandar, for one, is quite involved in sponsoring various rebel groups in Syria. And I guess we can argue about the definition of terrorism and freedom fighting, but I think it is pretty clear that Saudi Arabia is supporting groups that use terror as a tactic in Syria. So, that would be, sort of, evidence, wouldn't it? DW:Sure, I mean I think that some of Saudi Arabia's identified clients in Syria are extremely unappealing. For instance, the extremist group most convincingly tied to Saudi governmental assistance is called Jaysh al-Islam, or the Army of Islam, which is led by a man called Zahran Alloush, whose father is a preacher in Saudi Arabia, and who advocates ethnic cleansing of Shiites and opposes democracy. This is an organisation that by and large is repulsive and antithetical to western values, and it's an organisation that the US has been, to my understanding, pushing the Saudis behind the scenes to reduce their support for. OB:You just mentioned how little support there is for the Saudis and their tactics among  the American public. And yet American politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, seem to be sort of welcoming, or at least tight-lipped, when it comes to criticism of the Saudi officials. Why do you think that is? DW:Well, I think we need to differentiate between the executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue. Because, I think the legislative branch has been quite comfortable raising concerns about Saudi policies that conflict with universal human rights and democratic values. So for instance, members of Congress for both parties, in the last week and a half, have issued letters to the President, calling on him to make human rights part of the discussion, and to make religious freedom part of the discussion when he went to Saudi Arabia. So I do think that American politicians of both stripes, be it Democratic or Republican, are not reluctant to speak out about this issue. But I do think that when either party is in power at the White House, they certainly have incentives to try elicit regional cooperation from the Saudis, and unfortunately sometimes that means human rights reform issues get kicked a little bit lower on the priority list. Just as that sometimes is the case in US relations with Russia. American officials would actually like to be raising these issues even more often than they do with Russia, but because of Russia's important role as a geopolitical power, don't even raise it as much as they actually would, as surprising as that may be for some of your viewers to hear. OB:But Dr Weinberg, I wonder how much more often those issues could be raised? Because I think human rights in Russia is one of the most popular issues for American politicians, whether of the executive or legislative branch. But going back to Saudi Arabia, President Obama has just visited Riyadh. What do you think he was hoping to achieve there? DW:Well I think the messaging coming out of the White House really focused on trying to dispel the image that there's a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United States. So even as the President's plane was pulling into Saudi Arabia, his deputy national security advisor was giving a briefing to the press corps, and he was trying to emphasise that things have gotten better in the US-Saudi relationship since the fall, when the Saudis were upset. So, not denying that the Saudis have been upset with the US, but trying to argue that that dispute over Iran, over Syria, over other issues, has been resolved or at least significantly reduced. As to whether that narrative is going to be seen as persuasive, either by the media or the general public, we still have yet to see. OB:Now the biggest strain, as many analysts have identified, in this bilateral relationship is Americas reluctance to fully back the Saudis in their existential fight against the Shia forces of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, possibly Iraq. And this fight that the Saudis are in is not driven by money, it is not driven by political calculations. It is driven by genuine values, however archaic and bigoted they may be. And I wonder, given the existential nature of this fight, whether Americans can really reason with the Saudis at this point, or is it increasingly a case of the tail wagging the dog here DW:Well, I certainly would agree with you with regard to your argument that this is an area where the US really has some difficulties satisfying the Saudis fully. You know, the Saudi public sees what's going on in Syria as the greatest humanitarian calamity of our age. And that's not my words, that's the Saudi Foreign Minister's words. And so what they see are Shiites, whom they already have dehumanised in their education and religious system as heretics, slaughtering Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, slaughtering Sunni civilians as well as rebels. And so, in that regard, the Saudis want the US to decapitate the regime in Syria, at the very least by toppling it. And so the Saudis are not going to be satisfied when they see the US pursuing an approach that actually, in some regards on the battlefield, is quite similar to Russia's strategy, which is to have this conflict turn into a stalemate. The Russians want to enable Assad to not be toppled, to outlast the conflict. And the US wants to ensure, like Russia purportedly, a political solution to this conflict, by ensuring that the rebels are not fully marginalised on the battlefield. But when it comes to actually toppling the Assad regime militarily, the US administration has held back to some extent until now. And we'll just have to see whether the Saudis can convince them to take a harder line on this. It certainly could happen, especially if there's no progress at Geneva. OB:Since you mentioned Russia's intentions in Syria, I think Russia would much have preferred not having this conflict to begin with. I think this conflict was initiated and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US to begin with. So it is those two countries that actually opted for changing the status quo. But rather than going in depth into Syria, I would like to ask you very quickly – this relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was founded on a quite explicit agreement that Washington would defend the Gulf state in exchange for oil contracts. And the US no longer needs that much Saudi oil, and the nature of security threats has also changed. So I wonder if it's possible that, sooner or later, the US and Saudi Arabia will have to part ways? DW:Well, first of all, I'd like to address something that you said right before your question, which is how this conflict started. As Americans see it, the way this conflict started was a Russian supported dictator, Bashar al-Assad, slaughtered his people when they went out on the street and peaceably demonstrated. As well as arresting and torturing teenagers. So that is how we see how this conflict started.  As to whether the US and the Saudis - OB:Well, you see this conflict this way because you are told that this conflict started this way. As somebody who was on the ground in Syria, all those three years ago, I can tell you that there were snipers, there were provocation, there were Saudi agents there on the scene. So obviously the tactics of Bashar al-Assad are not to be defended, and his indiscriminate use of force. But I wonder if the US would react in any different way if the constitutional law and order were threatened? For once, if I can remind you of the search operation for the Boston bombers, if you remember a couple of years ago. The whole city of Boston was blocked to find two men, police was used and he was shot dead. So, I think Americans use force quite extensively when their own security is compromised, but they for some reason deny that right to other countries. But I would still like you to answer that question about whether you see any chance for the US and Saudi Arabia parting ways geopolitically, given how different their value systems really are? DW:Well, having lived in Boston, having actually lived on the same block as the Boston bomber, having been a graduate student at MIT in the past where a police officer was slaughtered by the bombers – no doubt Americans take terrorism seriously. As to whether the Saudis and the US are going to part ways, the triumphalism of the shale energy  boom  to some extent is overwrought. Because the US, just as Russia, just as other countries are in the global economy, are dependant on stability in the global price of oil. And in that regard, until industrialised countries such as the US, such as Russia, such as the countries of east and south Asia, have fuel choice about the fuel they put in their automobiles, we're going to be continually dependant on the security in the Gulf. OB:I see. Dr Weinberg, we have to take a short break now, but when we come back - the United States has rediscovered its good old enemy in Russia. What does this mean for the future of US-Saudi relations? That's coming up in a few moments on Worlds Apart. OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the love-hate relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia with David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. DW:That's a great way of putting it. OB:Dr Weinberg, you just heard, I turned it in terms of love and hate, and I'm not sure about the love, but to see the examples of hatred, all you need to do is to open the Saudi school textbooks, which you alluded to earlier, that for decades have been spewing vitriol at everything Western. And as you mentioned, you wrote a very interesting report recently on how lenient the US has been recently with Saudi Arabia on this issue. But I wonder, what is the real reason for Saudi procrastination in removing all those vitriolic passages from their textbooks? DW:Well, first of all, I'd like to say that I don't think that the US has been uniquely lax when it comes to raising Saudi textbooks. In fact, I think it's done more than any other government in its exchanges with the Saudi authorities on this issue. For instance, I saw no indication that this was part of the conversation when Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin met last year in Moscow. So I think there are things that other countries could do. That having been said, the US has more leverage that it could potentially use with Saudi Arabia on this issue. And in that regard, I really do with the US would do more. OB:Well Dr Weinberg, the reason why President Putin may not raise this issue, or other issues, with foreign visitors is because Russia doesn't make the promotion of democracy the pillar of its foreign policy. It's the US that does. And if I'm not mistaken, the State Department first noted a problem with the Saudi textbooks all the way back in 2003. And ever since then, the Saudis have assumed this very typical approach for them of not saying no outright, but not delivering either. And my question to you is whether they see any practical gain in essentially indoctrinating their youth in this mindset, whether they do it on purpose as a part of state ideology? DW:Well, I think Saudi Arabia, like any country, does have some internal debates, even as an absolute monarchy. But that having been said, I do think that the Saudi authorities bear responsibility for what's in these books, especially because these books are printed on an annual basis by their Ministry of Education. So they are to blame for what's published in their texts. The Saudi monarch, and the Saudi royal family, and the government say that these books have been reformed, that they're being improved. But when they say that, they only take the lowest hanging fruit. They take some of the hatred out of elementary school books. They say that they spent money on teacher training, to moderate teachers. They say that they're increasing the number of women in universities. But the reason that they don't take this on more seriously, I think, is because they see more benefit in not upsetting their conservative, reactionary preachers, than they see in telling their children a more tolerant view of the world and keeping their children from being indoctrinated. So I do think that it really will take diplomatic consequences in Saudi Arabia's foreign relations with the international community for this to change. OB:Now, this violent extremism that children are being taught in Saudi public schools is bad when it is targeted at you, but when it targets some of your rivals, it may come in handy. And here I would like to shift gears a little bit and discuss the Saudi-US relations vis-a-vis Russia, because there are quite a few historic examples when this partnership was very successful in undermining Moscow. I wonder whether these recent tensions that we saw between Russia and the West, and the US in particular, could lead President Obama to re-evaluate or rethink his relationship with Saudi Arabia. DW:Actually, I think US-Russian relations in the last month have added an extra strain to to the US-Saudi relationship. Because the Saudis wish that the US had been firmer with Russia over the Crimea. Just as they saw the US choosing to pursue a negotiated deal with Russia over Syria's chemical weapons in the fall, this was an area where US, Russia – I'd like to say at least averting away from more direct conflict – actually came at some cost to the US in its relationship with the Saudis. Similarly, the US helped turned the tide of the battle in Afghanistan in the '80s, against the Soviet Union, by introducing a large number of MANPADS – man-portable air defence systems – that the Mujahiddeen used against the Soviet air force. The US hasn't gotten much credit from the Russians for something that they've done, which is showing some restraint when it comes to MANPADS in Syria today. The Saudis have been itching to introduce those in massive numbers, unsupervised, without any sort of permissive action links, without any sort of way for the US, for instance, to disable them if they fall in the hands of Al Qaeda. But the US has actually held relatively firm on that to date, and that's an area in which the US hasn't gotten much credit. OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, I think this is a very novel interpretation of both recent events in history. Because if it wasn't for the US and Saudi Arabia, those weapons wouldn't be in Syria in the first place. So I don't see how we can credit the US for not restraining Saudi Arabia well enough. Going back to Ukraine, there have been reports that Washington has already reached out to Saudi Arabia to provide some of the $15 billion promised to Ukraine. And while Saudi Arabia doesn't have any intrinsic interest in Ukraine, what it is interested in is seeing Washington toughen up on Syria. And I wonder if we could see any sort of Ukraine-for-Syria swap here – essentially Saudi Arabia giving the money for Ukraine, but Washington in return doing what Riyadh wants it to do in Syria? DW:You know, actually the most persuasive tit-for-tat of this sort that I've seen has been a recent story in the Washington Post, suggesting that the US is finally considering doubling its training of vetted Syrian rebels, to be funded by the Qatari treasury. So if there's going to be a tit-for-tat, in this regard, that's actually where I've seen some suggestions that it might happen. OB:Now, Russia is a natural rival for the US in Ukraine, and for Saudi Arabia in Syria – so much so that George Soros has already suggested that the two team up in driving the oil prices down. And of course, this move proved to be very effective back in the '80s, when these two countries colluded in driving the oil prices down, and that proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union. Do you think that could work this time around? DW:No, I don't think there's persuasive US-Saudi collusion on the energy price that actually influences Saudi energy policy. The Saudis make their oil production decisions based on internal budgetary issues, and they do this also by looking at the domestic situation in Saudi Arabia and making outlays to keep their public quiet. So that, I think, is actually going to be the biggest driver of Saudi oil policy. But, you know, they can be hypocritical about this too, just as the US can be hypocritical about where and when it supports democracy, just as Russia can be hypocritical about where and when it supports sovereignty. OB:I wonder if we could consider one more way of how the Saudis and Americans could exact their vengeance, or their revenge on Russia, and that would be by supporting terror groups. They used to do that in Chechnya, as I mentioned before, and they could probably do the same in Crimea, which has a somewhat sizeable population, couldn't they? DW:Well actually, the Muslim population in Crimea is significantly smaller before Stalin ethnically cleansed the place. So actually, I think that leverage is much smaller now. OB:But, just fore the benefit of our viewers, as far as I know, I may be mistaken but back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Crimea was a very popular destination for wounded Chechen rebels. First, because of the geographic proximity to Chechnya, and also because of the somewhat lax security policy of the Ukrainian authorities. I think it is estimated that at the moment, there are around 5,000 followers of the Wahhabi branch of Islam in the Crimea, and I guess you wouldn't need even that many to stir trouble? DW:Well, you know, first of all it is important to distinguish between people's religious views, be they intolerant or not, and whether they're actually engaged in acts of violence. But certainly I do think that when an intolerant brand of religion is promoted in places abroad, including in elements of the Soviet Union, there are consequences for that down the road, absolutely. OB:Well one of the natural consequences for Moscow would be to deepen its ties with Tehran, especially given the very politically-correct reaction of the Rouhani government to Crimea's joining Russia. But I wonder if that will deepen the trenches even more in this geopolitical rivalry? DW:It's absolutely possible, but I do think it conflicts with what the Rouhani government's strategy is in Iran, which is a little bit different than what the Supreme Leader's strategy is in Iran. The Supreme Leader's strategy is direct confrontation with the US. The Rouhani government's strategy is to maintain many of the Islamic republic's policies, but to try and achieve some sort of rapprochement with the international community. They may not be ready to pay the cost of what that entails, and they've given no indication that they're ready to stop the IRGC's terrorist activities in places like the Levant and the Gulf. And that's actually what motivates the Saudis to push hard when it comes to Iran issues, and something that the US, personally I think, could be doing a little more on. Certainly Russia could do more on it as well.OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, unfortunately  we have to leave it there, I appreciate your being on the show. DW:Thank you, Oksana. OB:And to our viewers - keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and I hope to see you again - same place, same time here on Worlds Apart.

"28 Mar, 2014",​Intellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf-based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones. Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist. He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter. Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist. He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter. The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute. There were
  no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
  intellectual voices. There were absolutely no editorials written
  by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
  the destruction of its democratically elected government. It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
  translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West. There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
  actually happened in Ukraine recently. That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
  wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
  the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly-educated
  work force. They offered a deal. A very bad deal, under which,
  European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
  Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
  alone seek employment there. The elected government rejected such farce. The West accelerated
  its support to‘the opposition’, which included several
  clearly gangster forces, full of ultra-nationalists and Nazis.
  The legitimate government was overthrown. Crimea decided to leave
  such an illegitimate entity. People voted, democratically. Russia
  simply accepted the outcome. The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
  not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted. It is not used to
  such resistance – for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
  to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies. In the meantime, the fascist pro-Western military regime in Egypt
  (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
  people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
  Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer.  There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation.
  Fascist, Pinochet-style Egypt is a close Western ally. Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
  multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub-Saharan
  Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
  smoke coming from its burning forest-fires: proof of a
  gangster-run economy. Fires are destroying forests and giving way
  to palm oil plantations. Again no condemnation. Not even an
  alarm. Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
  6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
  (DRC). There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
  and governments, so it should not be discussed. The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
  Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
  ridiculous, pre-fabricated platform. The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
  the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if‘a friend’does it. In our recent book,‘On Western Terrorism – From Hiroshima to
  Drone Warfare’, my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
  how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
  countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
  with absolute impunity, even with legal support.  ""Take the invasion of Iraq - nothing can be discussed or
    potentially regarded as criminal. In fact there is a legal
    reason for that, which is not too well-known. The United States
    is self-immunized from any prosecution. When the US joined the
    World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
    International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
    reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
    treaty - meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
    Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions. The US
    is self-immunized from any trial on those issues. And the Court
    has accepted that. So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
    case against the United States at the World Court for the
    terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
    thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
    of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
    US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it."" ""In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
    where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
    bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
    United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
    agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
    genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
    Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
    ‘inapplicable to the United States’, and so therefore the Court
    rightly excused the United States from prosecution. There
    literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
    dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful. I am
    sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
    International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
    participate… but then it was more than that. The Congress
    passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
    signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
    Hague by force, in case any American was brought there. In
    Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act.
    Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
    self-immunization is at many levels. One is the impossibility
    to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
    indigenous population in the United States, when you just can’t
    see it even if it is in front of your eyes. The other is that
    it’s actually fortified by legislation.” Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
  it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
  disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice. David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
  House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
  media is playing. Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
  houses in English language. “Most people in Britain understand international politics
  through television news and mainstream newspapers. Both are
  heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
  coverage is scanty. Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
  Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all. Also, most of the
  press is notoriously right-wing – far to the right of the people
  as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
  who aggressively pursue a right-wing agenda through their
  publications. The state-owned BBC is committed to presenting a
  ‘balanced’ view of political issues, but its concept of balance
  is to present the views of both major British political parties.
  When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
  any dissenting voices,”David told me about this issue. The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
  the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
  just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
  greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
  so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
  international consensus. Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
  in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
  report:“The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
  the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
  and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
  and markets. The first theaters of operation in this global war
  were Africa and Yugoslavia. In Africa, America ejected France
  from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
  to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
  Africa.” The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
  in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
  Milosevic in 2001, Black says. In rapid succession the NATO
  states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria.
  The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
  vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
  Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
  sovereignty. “But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
  as the wars themselves are total wars - that is, wars targeting
  civilians as well as military forces - so the propaganda
  techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
  and penetrating all levels of society. Important elements of this
  propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
  function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
  concerned, and criminalization of those who resist,”Black
  told me. Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
  with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
  Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
  probably committed by members of that junta. Legendary radio host Dr. Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
  described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
  over the world. It is called‘USA declares war on
  democracy’. “In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
  before them, the banksters are adding violence to their ‘color
  revolution’ game plan for destroying democracy. This may seem
  incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
  gun Gene Sharp, the so-called ‘Machiavelli of non-violence’,
  designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
  and democratic uprisings. But Sharp's so-called color
  revolutions, beginning with Georgia's ‘Rose Revolution’ of 2003
  and Ukraine's ‘Orange Revolution’ of 2004, were never genuine
  people's revolutions. They were bankster takeover attempts from
  the beginning. George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
  ambitious, power-hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
  target countries with propaganda and hire rent-a-mobs to dress in
  a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
  square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
  ‘revolution’ – whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
  leader,”Barrett wrote. But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
  surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance. While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
  Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
  defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
  appears that the great majority of the Western public is
  thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
  alternative voices. Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
  co-editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva.com.ua, put
  everything into context. “What’s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
  turmoil? It’s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
  those far-right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
  leading role in the recent coup. There were only some rare
  reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
  paramilitaries in Ukraine,”Kolesnik said. What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
  Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
  Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
  worldwide. Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
  leading role of the far-right is dismissed as‘Putin’s
  propaganda’. So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
  everything that Putin claims. “If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
  media would most likely denounce it as a ‘propagandist’
  statement. And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
  Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
  servility,”Kolesnik said. He also describes a typical message in online groups of the‘Euromaidan’movement and the network of Nazi‘Right
  Sector’units. “As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
  they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
  place so as to provide the picture needed: ‘Western journalists
  are coming, so we have to be in the square at… and show them our
  democratic intentions. Please, no Nazi salutes and anti-Semitic
  slogans at this time, as journalists will be there. And we can
  see how some mainstream media makes ‘professional’ reports,”he asserts.  Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
  of anti-fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
  pro-Russian protesters, the Western media never show it. But when
  an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
  as‘brutality against pro-democracy protesters’. Media
  dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as‘legitimate’and
  tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
  civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country. “Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
  info-war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
  they do. Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
  Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media – all working
  hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country,”he
  says. I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
  Kiev International Airport. I create a nice, neat folder that
  consists of several international periodicals. I am aware that
  soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
  metaphorically as well as in the real sense. Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
  in those well-edited and designed propaganda sheets. I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
  caricature of a half-naked President Putin on a heavily-armed
  tank. It reads‘The New World Order’. But it is not yet here, this New World Order. It is still the
  same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
  canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity. And it
  is done, they claim, in order to‘save it’, to make it
  pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel
  religions. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long-awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support. Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions. Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You’ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it’s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising. Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that’s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it’s public information. You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia – Ed.]. The Rose Revolution – there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia. This has been the ‘color revolutions’ that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way. It’s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments. It’s not something that comes as a surprise to me. SS:You’ve mentioned Georgia and Orange Revolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately – and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn’t deny actually doing it. What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it’s not the case this time. SR:Oh, it’s absolutely the same thing. USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you’ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now. You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan. Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the ’80s. SS:You’ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros. When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it. What’s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government. The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late ’60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another protégé of that whole Shachtmanite issues. You don’t have to look very far into Ukraine – the most powerful, most well-known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich. Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what’s going on with the government in Ukraine. He’s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations. SS:But funding social groups or organizations – is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions – that is funding the revolution, if you’re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government. That is inciting the revolution and I think it’s illegal by international laws, by far – the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years. SS:The revolutions that you’ve mentioned – the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine – many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest. I mean, surely you can’t deny genuine popular discontent – even the Russian president said “the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent.” SR:I absolutely agree. The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing. Put yourself in the US – if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown. SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev – you’re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying “things are planned” or “gotten out of control” – it’s a fine line. There are individuals who are very well-trained. These NGOs operate on every level. They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side. It’s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations. Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings. You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain. These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that’s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that’s putting it lightly. SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev. Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it’s much easier - because the patrols are less likely - it’s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places. Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners. And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don’t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists. SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world – because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia-Herzegovina - is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the European Union has gone through, specifically Greece, they’ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what’s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures. People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction. We’re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other. And that’s why you’ve got countries like Ukraine - the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 - that’s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that’s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it. Now, is it induced – obviously it is induced when it’s in the best interest of the US and it’s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I’d say, at least two or three decades. SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It’s also economic and it’s militarily strategic. Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they’ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya – these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev. Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West. That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe. That’s the main income, that’s helped Russia bounce back -three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it’s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well. So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time. SS:With everything that’s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says “can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO?” What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course – if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea. So it’s predominantly Ukrainian – you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti-Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich. So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it’s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it’s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west. At the same time it’s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it. But I think what you’ve run into is that they’ve fallen into the trap, the EU can’t handle another boat anchor - you know, they don’t need another failed economy, they are failing already. It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO’s perspective, they’ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it’s think it’s not in good faith what the West is doing. SS:If EU can’t give the money, as you’re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It’s what NATO gives every country – they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they’ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity. Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO – they’re moving closer and closer to the cusp of… and there’s a lot of money that comes with that. There’s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders - it comes with the good price tag. SS:So you’re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn’t just expect you to invest all your money…NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative. SS:If what you’re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I’m not saying for Russia, I’m saying for Ukraine. SR: Well, I wouldn’t say that either. Let’s say that NATO does want to come in - they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters - so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it’s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies…because NATO won’t come in as a state, run only…you know, European Union will have to come alongside it. So will have some financial gain, but it won’t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians. It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance. SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately. Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill. There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding. Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get. Even John Hulsman said in last week’s interview that you did, that they weren’t playing honestly or they just weren’t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can’t afford it in the EU. So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that’s totally busted anyway. The only reason it’s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton-Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it’s all basically paper money that doesn’t really exist in this world. They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy. I’ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it. I think the Western economy is poison. SS:You keep saying that the EU can’t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May. Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that. That’s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that… it’s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it’s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn’t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic. That’s the problem that I have with this. You talk about hegemony - the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West – there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance. I don’t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance. SS:What about these sanctions that the U.S. and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy. What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally - I think it’s an act of war – and obviously it wouldn’t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success. They would slow down the amount of success that they are having. The kinds of sanctions that they’ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts. They’ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus. That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the European Union, and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit. SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won’t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don’t think they’ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they’ve done to Iran. At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia…you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe. So they’ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets. Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time. SS:But what about Europe, we didn’t follow up on that part of the question. Europe – it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn’t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all. Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry. I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors. I don’t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states. SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it’s probably the only economy that’s actually on the rise. Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany… SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise. SS:…It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating. Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine. I mean, we keep saying “Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries,” how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn’t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don’t think they can. I can’t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage’s commentary on this. He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the European Union. I think he’ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don’t have the money. I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine. SS:If they don’t have the money, then what’s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking ‘funny money’.

"14 Mar, 2014",'Britain’s being relegated to lowest tier in EU’ - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse. Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near-death state of Ukrainian finances – but doesn’t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament. Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it’s great to have you with us today. I’m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously – “…the EU’s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine.” Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them – how and why? Bill Cash:I’m very much in favor of political cooperation, I’m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it’s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious. It would have been far better if it had been a lower-key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was“misconceived”and he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I’ll just quote from it:“This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits.”In retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes. It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement. Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn’t been so ambitious. I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue – the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely naïve. I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation. SS:But what about now, Mr. Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it’s on the brink of bankruptcy – can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is“No”, and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this – because when they say“35 billion”you can usually add quite a lot more. The fact is that proportionately, we’re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt. SS:But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give – how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won’t end up in the new elite’s pockets? BC:Well, that’s a very important question. It could apply to almost any country of the EU. The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years – so the probability of the money getting astray is very-very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption. That is well known. Quite frankly, we don’t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don’t think the money is there to pay for it. SS:Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms. What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don’t know. What I do know is that there are very big questions here - I mean, I’m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well-negotiated answer to these problems. I’m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel. But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis. I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years. SS:Keeping in mind everything you’ve said right now, Mr. Cash and talking about being realistic – what do you think about Ukraine’s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries. I’m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states. I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate. I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said“we should be associated, but not absorbed”, and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion - I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I’m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional. It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I’m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected. There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law. If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation. I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U.S. and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating. SS:Yeah, but it doesn’t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break. I’m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U.S. diplomats which openly dismiss the EU’s efforts in Ukraine – should the EU swallow its pride and follow America’s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the European Union must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy. I’m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many-many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo – I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU. It is just simply a complete mess, and I don’t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy. I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability – and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries. I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy. SS:The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I’ve seen the regulations in question. In fact, I’m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I’ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth. But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning –“Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you”, and given the fact that everyone is saying there won’t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that’s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others – then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very-very bad situation. When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better. SS:Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office. Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don’t regard the EU as having its own money as such – it’s a way of interpreting the situation. When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it’s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government – then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don’t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it. As far as I’m concerned, it’s our money and I’m very glad we’re getting it back again. I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself. SS:Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem. As one EU official put it, the scale of it is “breathtaking”. Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking. I may say that I wouldn’t exonerate any country, I don’t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world. It’s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy. It’s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts. All I can say is that it has to be dealt with. The court of Auditors of the EU do their best. We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly – every year. I’ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn’t been signed off, as far as I’m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife. I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether. SS:Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well. Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU. We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I’ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don’t think that the consequences – and this is a very large subject - of majority voting and co-decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need. I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically. I don’t think that’s healthy, as I’ve said in Germany itself, I don’t think it’s healthy for Germany and I don’t think it’s healthy for Europe as a whole. SS:Now you’ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project. Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message – and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two-tier Europe – which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I’ve said over this, over the last 20 years – there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent. But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I’m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want. That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time. SS:Talking about great democracy and protecting it – you’ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration. What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I’ve just said. By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives – because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy. SS:But, here’s another thing. You’ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream – what’s changed? BC:Well, I think that’s the recognition that it didn’t work. It has taken a very-very long time. People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin-masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it’s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments. It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK’s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who’ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right – not with any great self-satisfaction, because as far as I’m concerned, it’s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s. SS:Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even. Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration. You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land-mass. Unlike France it is a relatively small land-mass. And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded. I am actually not in principle against immigration – I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen. But, by the same token, there have to be limits. An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages. SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation. Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain’s membership of the EU.

"13 Mar, 2014",​Soros tells Europe: Imposing sanctions on Russia not the best way forward,"Billionaire financier George Soros says the Ukrainian turmoil is a “wake-up call” for Europe, which should remember its aim and focus on integration. The EU must aid Ukraine financially or technically, rather than cut ties with Russia. ""It's very important to respond and respond the right way
  which is not necessarily to impose sanctions on Russia, but to
  actually help Ukraine financially and also technical assistance,
  something like a European Marshall Plan for Ukraine, that would
  be the right response,"" Soros said in an interview to
  Bloomberg. Under the post-war Marshall Plan the US provided help to Western
  Europe worth billions of dollars – in the form of food, fuel,
  machinery and investment. Europe may face 25 years of stagnation if government officials
  don’t make an effort to strengthen and further integrate the
  currency union, Soros warned. Such a prolonged economic slowdown
  may prove unsustainable for Europe, he added. The financial crisis in Europe which began in 2010 has almost
  ended. However the region is still facing a political crisis,
  which has split the area into country creditors and country
  debtors, Soros said. “You have to go further with the integration. You have to
  solve the banking problem, because Europe is lagging behind the
  rest of the world in sorting out its banks.” At the same time banks are oriented to passing the stress tests,
  instead of stimulating the economy by capital injections in
  business, Soros believes. According to Soros, the EU gave a poor option to Ukraine which
  gave the advantage to Russia. ""Europe, true to form, demanded a lot and offered
  little,""Soros said. ""It was not difficult for Putin to
  come up with a better offer."" The crisis in Ukraine emerged last year when former President
  Victor Yanukovich decided not to sign an association agreement
  with the European Union, and instead opted for help from the
  Russia. The move caused mass protests in Ukraine which led to
  Yanukovich's overthrow. Now the country faces an economic crisis
  and military pressure from Russia. George Soros, a magnate and investor is known as ""The Man Who
  Broke the Bank of England"" because of his short sale of $10
  billion worth of pounds, giving him a profit of $1 billion during
  the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/business/soros-europe-russia-sanctions-514/
"27 Feb, 2014",‘West plays with fire to drive the Russian naval base out of Crimea’,"Crimea’s ethnic composition and Western policy towards Ukraine could create a Kosovo-like scenario where the majority of Russian speaking residents would claim independence which could lead to violence on the ground, Oxford historian Mark Almond told RT. RT:If the EU and the US are concerned about
  doing what people on the Maidan want, why are they ignoring what
  people in Crimea want? Mark Almond:Well one would have thought so if
  you’re going to listen to the crowd on the street on the square
  and there are many squares where there’re crowds including
  Simferopol and Sevastopol. The basic problem of course is what
  the Americans, particularly the lead military power in NATO want,
  is to eventually ease the Russian navy out of its base, out of
  its lease in Sevastopol in the Crimea. And so of course the fact
  that the great majority of people in Crimea not only 60 per cent
  that are actually Russian but many of the rest who speak Russian
  as their everyday language is something that the EU and NATO
  countries want to ignore. Of course if you have any kind of push
  to create a crisis, I’m afraid our democratic basis as in Kosovo
  where the great majority, where the great majority of Albanians
  wanted to be independent from Serbia, you would create a Kosovo
  crisis in Crimea. But of course strangely enough Washington and
  Brussels suddenly aren’t terribly interested in this. I myself
  think that creating a crisis is not a good idea, but nonetheless
  they seem to be bent on pushing to increase tension between
  people on the Peninsula. And of course there is a risk of
  violence against either ethnic Russians, civilians that are there
  or against the sailors and soldiers on the base. RT:The Crimean Tatars have long been
  calling for the establishment of their own autonomy, why are they
  now siding with the pro-EU crowds in Kiev? MA:I think this is a very incoherent position.
  The Tatars historically are seen as the traditional native
  inhabitants of the Crimea. Catherine the Great’s Russia took over
  250 years ago and then of course Khrushchev, the communist
  dictator gave Crimea to Ukraine only 60 years ago. The Tatars
  feel that they have been neglected and eventually many of them
  who have been forced out of their territory have come back. But I
  think it is a great mistake to think that they are the supporters
  of the Ukrainian nationalism. My experience in the Crimea is that
  most Tatars speak Russian as their everyday language and of
  course they do learn Tatar as well. And they don’t have any great
  sympathy for Ukrainian nationalism and now of course the
  transitional government in Kiev has abolished the language
  rights, not only Russian but of Tatars and Hungarians in the
  West. So again we have this paradox. The EU is a great believer
  of minority rights, except when these minorities aren’t fully
  paid up supporters of its crowd on the streets of central Kiev.
  And I think again many Tatars in fact walked to the
  demonstration, I don’t think that we should overate the fact that
  a group of people, many of them have been beneficiaries of George
  Soros’s language schools and scholarships. We should not be
  overrating how many of the many thousands of Tatars who live in
  Crimea necessarily want trouble. I think this is an exaggeration.  RT:At the start of the rally in Crimea, we
  saw the Tatars vastly outnumbering the ethnic Russian crowd. Does
  that reflect the real numbers among these ethnic groups
  there? MA:No, of course what we see, actually what we
  saw on Maidan Square in Kiev, strangely enough the spontaneous
  demonstrations of pro-westerners is much better organized, funded
  when you bring in Brussels and lorry loads of people. But of
  course once this crowd assembled, I’m afraid it drew out the
  majority of the local population who are Russians, and this is
  very dangerous. It seems to me that the Americans and the people
  in the Soros foundation who support these local nationalist
  groups are playing with fire. Because if you begin to send out a
  relatively small crowd of people to ban things that frighten the
  majority of people in the first place. It is very dangerous just
  like it would be if suddenly a lot of Russians appeared in Lvov,
  in Western Ukraine and started saying “Shouldn’t we all be part
  of Russia”. It would be very provocative and very dangerous. But
  it seems to me that the West is not totally concerned about this
  danger and that I think could lead to another Crimean War
  exploding in our faces 160 years after the last one RT:How did these ethnic groups end up in
  Crimea anyway? MA:As I’ve said about 250 years ago, Crimea was
  ruled by the Muslim Tatar Khans who were subjects of the Ottoman
  Empire. Catherine the Great of Russia conquered what we now call
  the Ukraine and the Crimea. Then with the WWI, the Russian
  Revolution tool place and the anti-communists were driven out of
  Crimea and most of Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union. When
  Hitler came in 1941, he eventually captured Sevastopol in Crimea.
  But when the Nazis were forced to withdraw, Stalin took the view
  that the ethnic Tatars were being anti-Russian, anti-Soviet have
  collaborated with the Nazis. I think this is a travesty of the
  behavior of most those Tatars, although ironically now we have
  Germans newspapers saying, how wonderful the Tatars are to be
  collaborating with the united Europe. Leave that aside, huge
  numbers of Tatars were deported to Central Asia. Eventually in
  the Gorbachev period 30 years ago they were allowed to return, to
  come back to the Crimea. Sadly in the meantime all sorts of other
  people, who lived there themselves of course, could be Russians
  for generations, or people who in the Soviet period have moved
  in, are living where they’re used to live.  So the tragedy for many of the Tatars is that they have left
  where they have grown up in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, come back
  to the Crimea and find nowhere to live, live in poverty and I’m
  afraid to say some of whom may be agitatedbecause of the living
  rate poverty. People also in the Western Ukraine do when somebody
  comes and says, you could have a career, here is a little bit of
  money to set up an activist NGO group and so on - who would not
  take it if you are destitute. And that I think is the danger. We
  have in fact an under employed population who can be agitated. RT:So what do you think will happen next in
  Crimea? MA:Well Crimea which is such a beautiful place
  should be the center of interaction between the Russian cultures,
  Chekov lived there, of Tatar culture and the playground on the
  seashore. The danger is if you allow people to be obsessed that
  one nation has to dominate, and in this case a very small number
  of Ukrainians who live in Crimea are being used by the great
  majority of the Ukrainians who live outside the Peninsula and by
  the West because it wants to get rid of the Russian naval base,
  to be a battering ram. And I think this is very dangerous.
  Ideally Crimea would be a sunny playground for everybody to
  enjoy. Sadly, I think people from a long way away are prepared to
  play with fire to drive the naval base out. But if we remember
  what happened in 1850s, we can discover that the Crimean conflict
  can turn out to drag in other people. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-crimea-west-policy-942/
"15 Nov, 2013",Gays caused Chelyabinsk meteorite? Russian LGBT community accuses TV show of hate speech,"A Russian TV host has made quite a peculiar remark linking the Chelyabinsk meteorite and the country’s gay movement. Russia’s LGBT community reacted angrily and asked prosecutors to check the host’s show for hate speech. In a reference to the Old Testament story of the cities of Sodom
  and Gomorrah, famous journalist Arkady Mamontov said on his
  program that the fall of the Chelyabinsk meteorite on February 15
  in Russia was related to the country’s growing gay activity.
  Mamontov’s program ‘Special Correspondent’ airs on state channel
  Rossiya 1.The host called the meteorite a warning ""to all of us that we
  should keep the family tradition, traditional love, or else
  something else - not only the Chelyabinsk meteorite - will hit
  us.""The Russian LGBT Network rights group filed a complaint with the
  prosecutor’s office on Thursday. The group accused the show of
  hate speech, according to group chairman Igor Kochetkov. He said
  that Mamontov also claimed that gays and lesbians want to
  ""destroy [traditional] Russia.”  A Special Correspondent episode aired on Tuesday included the new
  documentary film ‘Litsedei’ (Hypocrites), which tells of the
  alleged threat from Western countries that are trying to carry
  out a “gay revolution” in Russia by organizing a protest movement
  based on claims that homosexuals are oppressed.The film also alleges that conferences of the LGBT community in
  Russia are sponsored from abroad - in particular by the fund of
  American business magnate George Soros.In a statement on the website of the Association of Russian
  Lawyers for Human Rights, lawyer and human rights activist Maria
  Bast – who was featured in the documentary – accused the makers
  of slander and misrepresentation. She went on to say that the
  film reflected intolerance and fascism.Russia’s leading LGBT activist and lawyer, Nikolay Alekseev, has
  submitted a request to Moscow authorities to gain permission to
  stage a protest against Mamontov’s show. He also said on his
  Facebook page that he gave a two-hour interview to the filmmakers
  but that none of it was aired. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/meteorite-lgbt-russia-mamontov-749/
"26 Aug, 2013",The world according to the global power brokers,"When the World Economic Forum released its 2013 Global Risks Report earlier this year, it included an interesting array of proposals which should raise eyebrows and be taken very seriously.

  address many of the challenges that we all know about – growing
  social and political violence, the West’s on-going financial
  collapse, food and water shortages, and the Elite’s all-time
  favorite“global terrorism”. However, they also worked out“proposals for government”and some rather uncanny“X Factors”which, coming as they
  do from one of the global powers favorite think-tanks, we would
  do well to read between the lines. As German playwright Johann W. Goethe once remarked,“coming
  events cast their shadows forwards”. This is particularly
  true when those shadows are cast by global power brokers in a
  position to drive and control those coming events, according to
  their hearts’ desire, and here we are talking about the World
  Economic Forum (WEF), founded in 1971. Chaired by Klaus Schwab,
  who sits on David Rockefeller’s Trilateral Commission, means he
  has direct access to the families of Rockefeller, Bush, Soros,
  Kissinger, Brzezinski, Rothschild, Lazard, Harriman, Montbatten,
  Warburg, Schiff, Borbón, and Orange.  Indeed, it is from behind these curtains that the global elite
  are planning to impose a world government on all mankind; by
  designing, planning, and executing the macro-changes that they
  need to impose upon all countries – each according to need and in
  their due time - as the process of privatizing global power rams
  forwards on a global scale. Two interesting issues are being highlighted by the elite through
  the WEF: the re-engineering of national governments, and the
  introduction of so-called“X Factors”into the collective
  psyche. Subtitled“Lessons Learned from around the World; Global
  Agenda Council on the Future of Government”, this WEF piece
  written in 2011 echoes the Council on Foreign Relations academic,
  Richard Gardner’s seminal essay written almost forty years ago on
  the“hard road to the new world order”, where he
  recommended sovereign Nation-states should be eroded“piece by
  piece”. This Report urges governments to“align to the future by
  adapting and continuously evolving to create value”, adding
  that governments“need to stay relevant by being responsive to
  rapidly changing conditions and citizens’ expectations, and build
  capacity to operate effectively in complex, interdependent
  networks of organizations and systems across the public, private
  and non-profit sectors to co-produce public value.” It then goes on to recommend“what is needed today is Flatter,
  Agile, Streamlined and Tech-enabled (FAST) government.” Translating this think-tankese mumbo-jumbo into English, we get: Flatter = less authority; less sovereignty; Agile = more malleable; controllable; Streamlined = less meaningful; less powerful. Tech-enabled = subservient to those who own/operate/control
  technological R&D. Need we remind ourselves that the true mission of sovereign
  nation-states is not to“adapt and continuously evolve”which, again, is think-tankese for“aligning to the coming
  world government, or else”? The true and inalienable functions of sovereign nation-states and
  their governments are to: Promote the Common Good of the vast majority of the people over
  and above the interests and greed of powerful local and/or
  foreign minorities, that are embedded in local, public and
  private power structures, and Defend the country’s national interest in today’s dangerous, even
  deadly, world made so precisely because of small and
  illegitimately powerful minorities that have everywhere usurped
  far too much power. President Putin of Russia understands this only too well; so does
  president Xi Jinping of China.  Most other countries,
  however, either never learned this fundamental lesson or seem to
  have forgotten it.  The global elites suggest a number of measures to“align civil
  service systems to the requirements of their proposed ‘FAST
  Governments’ based on such factors as carefully planned workforce
  reductions coupled with the significant organizational,
  technological and workforce advances inherent in FAST governments
  to build slim and streamlined organizations that can thrive in
  the new world order... Adaptive governments that share labor,
  services and resources through networked approaches and Gov 2.0
  strategies can remain slim while delivering on their mission in
  effective and innovative ways.” Yes, I know: this sounds far more like a Corporate Annual Report
  than a geopolitical piece for creative statesmanship. “The authors challenge governments to design and implement two
  new complementary ways of assessing governments’ performance. The
  first set of measures consists of a holistic approach to
  government performance along the four axes defined earlier as
  FAST.  The second set of measures focuses on measuring
  the value of such transformation to citizens.” If where it says“government”, you read“corporations”, and where it says“citizens”, you
  read“clients”, then you get a blueprint for private
  government. Prying farther into what the future holds in store for us, Mr.
  Schwab’s team partnered with the editors of Britain’s leading
  science journal, Nature, and came up with a series of“X
  Factors”, five of which are truly revolutionary
  game-changers. Just take a look at them, and then let’s infer what might lie
  behind the curtain: 1)“Runaway climate change: Is it possible that we have
  already passed a point of no return and that Earth’s atmosphere
  is tipping rapidly into an inhospitable state?”This
  ties in nicely with the Elite’s proposal of imposing a Global
  Carbon Tax backed by the coming world government’s legal
  framework, which will serve as a tool to control every country,
  region, city, and individual by allocating “carbon credits” based
  on their“carbon footprint”, thereby globally controlling
  all permissible activity. 2)“Significant cognitive enhancement: Ethical dilemmas akin
  to doping in sports could start to extend into daily working
  life; an arms race in the neural ‘enhancement’ of combat troops
  could also ensue.”Such scientific and technological
  breakthroughs are all basically controlled through the global
  network of mega corporate high-tech laboratories.  We have
  an example in Monsanto’s patenting of genetically modified seeds;
  the leitmotiv is to impose uncrackable, unhackable, high-tech and
  secret encoding over just about every resource on planet Earth:
  from seeds to sports competitions; from NSA eavesdropping to
  military gear. The coming world government will reserve for its
  exclusive use specific override code factors that will allow them
  to take over communications systems, power grids and aircraft –
  military and civilian, in flight and on the ground (9/11
  Conspiracy Theorists take note!). 3)“Rogue deployment of geo-engineering: Technology is now
  being developed to manipulate the climate; a state or private
  individual could use it unilaterally.”As if we
  did not know about Project HAARP – High Frequency Active Auroral
  Research Program – based in Alaska and Norway which has been
  undoubtedly playing dirty tricks all over the world, creating
  droughts and flooding!! It appears that HAARP installations can generate directed high
  power electromagnetic standing waves over specific geographical
  areas that interfere with weather fronts, stopping rain clouds in
  their tracks. This can lead to too much rain on one side
  (floods) and too little rain on the other (droughts) of these
  invisible standing waves.  Also, as geologists well know, certain high power precisely aimed
  radio frequencies can be made to resonate with tectonic plates
  that are“ready to slip”; so with the right data the HAARP
  weapon might be used to trigger earthquakes/seaquakes that are
  “ready to happen”. 4)“Costs of living longer: Medical advances are prolonging
  life, but long-term palliative care is expensive. Covering the
  costs associated with old age could be a struggle.”A
  warning: The mysterious and anonymous Georgia Guidestones erected
  in 1980 in Ebert, Georgia which read like the global
  commandments, starts off by recommending the elites“maintain
  humanity under 500.000.000, in perpetual balance with
  nature”.  Global depopulation is a-coming… 5)“Discovery of alien life: Proof of life’s existence
  elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological
  implications for human belief systems.”What a
  convincing way to bring on world government almost
  overnight!  In a Speech at the UN in 1987, former US
  President Ronald Reagan asked“how quickly our differences
  worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from
  outside this world. And yet, I ask is not an alien force ALREADY
  among us?”Hmmm… Contact with alien life forms would demand a unified
  representation for all of mankind; yes indeed: a world
  government.  And, of course, over the past 70 years,
  Hollywood has mentally programmed the world to accept that any
  such contact would be with the Elite’s key representative, the
  United States. If one day soon little green men from Mars were to
  tell any human,“take me to your leader”, the proper
  landing strip will, of course, be the White House lawn. The think-tankese conclusion:“The Global Risks Report is the
  flagship research publication of the ‘World Economic Forum’s Risk
  Response Network’ providing an independent platform for
  stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate on building
  resilience to global risks.” Translation: Whoever controls the global agenda, the politically
  correct limits of debate and technological change, has an awfully
  huge edge over the rest of mankind, whether they are grouped by
  regions, nations, ideologies, demographics, raw material wealth,
  or whatever. Actually, all this rings much more like an attempt at generating
  self-fulfilling prophecies, rather than on trying to understand
  how to tackle the world’s future problems. Goethe was right: coming events do cast their shadows
  forward.  The global elites’ mad drive to impose world
  government on all of us is exactly that: an increasingly dark
  shadow bent on dragging us all into the darkest night. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

"19 Apr, 2013",Gold bounces back – but for good?,"Gold is on the rebound after a 4.5% drop this week, and the plunge has triggered serious concern about the condition of the global economy. The Comex index has passed the $1,400 mark, gaining 21.5 points
to $1,412.60 an ounce at 15:17 DST. “We are already seeing a strong response to the fall in
prices, with a sharp pick-up in physical gold sales by investors
and retail consumers in the two key consumer markets - India and
China,”Mark Pervan, head of commodity strategy at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group, wrote toBloombergtoday. While the value of the biggest gold producers declined by $169
billion, jewelers took advantage of the 30-year record-low gold
prices to stock up for anticipated high demand retail and jewelry
sales. Chinese and Indian jewelers are optimistic that gold will
rebound as much as 29% by December 2013, to as high as $1,800 an
ounce, as demand increases, according to billionaire Indian jeweler
T.S Kalyanaraman,Reutersreported. “There’s been continued buying interest, particularly into
China,”Nigel Moffatt, treasurer of Australia’s Perth Mint said
on Bloomberg Television Friday. Americans took advantage of the price dip to buy stock in a
historically high yielding investment. In April, the US Mint sold 153,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins, a three year high, according to its website. The recent slump in gold has been paired with disturbing
economic data forecasting significant slowing in some of the
world’s largest economies – the US,China, andRussia. The gold drops are ""signaling concerns about global growth,""
said Mohamed El-Erian, the co-chief investment officer of PIMCO,
which oversees $2 trillion in assets,Reutersreported. ""Commodities have been sending the signal on growth for a
while, and now even louder,""El-Erian added. Gold has certainly been the ‘loudest’ of the flailing indexes,
after it plunged 14% in the first two April sessions, hitting a
30-year low as slowed growth data from the US and China trickled
in. Prices also dropped as the Cypriot bailout payment plan toyed
with the idea of selling 75% of their reserves to help finance the
bailout, which spooked investors other cash-strapped European
states, like Spain and Portugal, might do the same. The economic slowdown was confirmed by the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday when it trimmed back its forecast on
economic growth in 2013, down to 3.3% from the earlier 3.5%
projection. Citigroup predicted, and was correct, that 2013 would be the
first year when commodity prices at the end of the year were lower
than at the beginning. Citigroup predicted the end of the ‘super-cycle’ – when rising
prices commodities supersede demand. As growth slows, governments are scrambling to find a way to
stay afloat. Most governments are doing this via cash stimulus-
simply printing more money to avoid deflation, the Bank of Japan
the premier example. The recent retreats in gold, oil, and other precious metals and
energy stocks, are evidence to many of a weak - and maybe slightly
unstable - economy. Because metals and energy are so closely tied
to industrial growth, a decline in their demand can provide an
accurate reading of an global economic performance.  As inflation falls, this in turn reduces the value of gold as a
fortification against rising prices. If investors forecast an
inflation dip, gold will also lose its value. ""Because the global economy is on the downside of a global
credit bubble, it seems unreasonable to expect abnormal
inflation,""said Richard Bernstein, the head of an investment
advisory firm in New York,Reutersreported. Gold, a major investment for both individuals and institutions,
provides a viable alternative to currency that their government can
just print more of. It also provides and investment alternative to
stocks. George Soros cut his holdings in SPDR Gold Trust by 55% last
quarter. He predicted the prices would tumble, and wasn't sure how
quickly they’d recover. The title of JPMogran’s gold futures report is‘The slide in
global inflation may not be over.’ Morgan Stanley has cut its 2013 gold forecast by 16%, down to
$1,487, as investors continue their selling frenzy. The sell-off “has all the hallmarks of panic-driven, stale long
liquidation, stop-loss and capitulation selling in the face of a
concerted short sale” Peter Richardson, a Morgan Stanley analyst,
wrote in a report. According to JPMorgan’s report, it’s not a time to invest, or
reinvest in gold. Merrill Lynch recently warned that gold could fall to $1,200
before stabilizing, citing ""fears of disinflation combined with
news of potential central bank gold selling,” in their Tuesday
report. ""Even at these levels, gold is still not attractive. The odds
favor the bull market being over,""said Jim McDonald, chief

position to gold, Reuters reported. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/business/gold-bounces-back-108/

Mongolia and elsewhere who use covert offshore companies and bank
accounts. Many of the world’s top’s banks – including UBS, Clariden
and Deutsche Bank – have aggressively worked to provide their
customers with secrecy-cloaked companies in…offshore
hideaways.”And they say they won’t turn over the files to government agencies.
Among the titbits they released so far are items such as “Deutsche
Bank Helped Customers Maintain Hundreds of Offshore Entities” and
“Post-Soviet Billionaires Invade UK ... ” They saydozens of selected journalistshave gone
through “millions of leaked records and thousands of names to
produce ICIJ’s investigation into offshore secrecy. A cache of 2.5
million files has cracked open the secrets of more than 120,000
offshore companies and trusts, exposing the hidden dealings of
politicians, con men and the mega-rich the world over. The secret
records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists lay bare the names behind covert companies and private
trusts…”  They omit to mention how ICIJ “obtained” such a
cache.Their selected scandals so far has hit French President Hollande,
Greek billionaires or Russian oligarchs. No scandal has hit the US
White House or Washington in any serious way. ICIJ’s
SüddeutscheZeitung  partner writes that they will expose arms
dealers, oligarchs, financial fraudsters and “hundreds of Germans…”
For owning an offshore account?The ICIJ groupclaims, “The hoard of documents represents
the biggest stockpile of inside information about the offshore
system ever obtained by a media organization... more than 160 times
larger than the leak of U.S. State Department documents by
Wikileaks in 2010.”For anyone with knowledge of how tightly controlled mainstream
global media is, the names of the newspapers the ICIJ chose to
analyze the documents include BBC and The Guardian in the U.K., The
Washington Post, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Le
Monde in France, Süddeutsche Zeitung in Germany, The Washington
Post, among others. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to
use his leadership of the G8 to help crack down on tax evasion and
money laundering. While the mainstream world press is focusing on the leaks, it’s
relevant to ask just who is this ICIJ leaker?According to their website, the ICIJ was founded in 1997 as a
project of the Center for Public Integrity“to extend the
Center’s style of watchdog journalism.” Among financial donors
to ICIJ are Open Society Foundations, which have been involved in
many countries targeted by the US State Department for regime
change or “color revolutions” including Georgia, Ukraine, Burma
(Myanmar), Libya. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of
Hewlett Packard founder and former Assistant Defense Secretary
David Packard, among others.But the more interesting organization is the one which created
ICIJ: the Center for Public Integrity, which shares the same office
floor with ICIJ. Here we find a creation of the most powerful
families of Wall Street and US political establishment. The Center
for Public Integrity was created in 1989 to“enhance
democracyby revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal
of trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the
tools of investigative journalism.”  Sounds noble
enough.Notably, however, listed funders in 2012 of the Center include the
Ford Foundation, documented in the Cold War to work intimately with
the CIA; George Soros’ Open Society Foundations; John D. &
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation; billionaire Wall Street banker
Sandy Bernstein’s Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC; GE
Foundation; Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller Family
Fund.Now what do America’s crème de la crème of powerful families and
bankers find so compelling about financing an organization of
journalists who now hold documents allegedly containing material
that could be used to blackmail governments and politicians and
businessmen around the globe? Are their offshore holdings to be
exposed along with those of Russians or French or Germans?The relevant question is what agency would have the capacity to
hack international computer data banks and secret encrypted banking
offshore records to give to ICIJ? The methodology of the ICIJ suggests another agenda at play. A
global witch-hunt against private fortunes—legal or illegal—has
begun. No longer is it a former employee of UBS or another Swiss
bank who steals data files of a few secret German clients to give
German tax authorities as an “act of conscience.” Now all offshore
accounts in the world can presumably be exposed as ICIJ
decides.James S. Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey & Company,estimatesthat wealthy individuals have $21
trillion to $32 trillion in private financial wealth tucked away in
offshore havens.The question is what agency or agencies of which governments have
the espionage facilities to pull off such a massive global hacking
of all offshore bank accounts?William A. Hamilton was involved in the Reagan years with a project
that the National Security Agency initiated to interdict the sale
of embargoed technology to the Soviet Union. In a recent exchange
with the author regarding the “source” for the ICIJ files on global
offshore accounts, Hamilton noted, “NSA is one and perhaps the only
obvious candidate.” He added that in the 1980s the NSA “obtained
a copy of [Hamilton’s software] PROMIS from the US Department of
Justice and arranged for copies to be installed on computers in the
banking sector (wire transfer clearing houses…the World Bank…major
commercial and investment banks worldwide) to facilitate NSA's
real-time electronic surveillance.”  Clearly in the
intervening three decades the NSA international banking covert
espionage capabilities must have been upgraded.There is a role for genuine honest investigative journalism, but
the Secrecy for Sale project of the ICIJ smells like a massive US
Government-sponsored blackmail or worse against the rest of the
world’s wealth. As Rockefeller family protégé Henry Kissinger
reportedly said during the 1970’s, “If you control the money, you
control the entire World…”F. William Engdahl can be reached through his website at

"15 Apr, 2013",Is the dragon asleep? China’s growth disappoints analysts and markets,"China’s economic growth has lost momentum, its GDP expanded 7.7% in the first quarter, missing the 7.9% benchmark of the previous quarter, a sobering reality that global recovery is slowing. China has been coined by America as an economic ‘sleeping
giant’: a power that will suddenly awake at any moment and
supersede the US as the world’s biggest economy. But the numbers are telling a different story. 
According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics in
Beijing, the GDP missed its forecast, an indicator that even China
isn’t immune to global recession. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen on the GDP news and is
down 10% from an early February high. It fell 1.1% on Monday down
to 2,181.94 at market close, the lowest level since December
24. “The disappointing data shows the recovery is much weaker and
bumpier than expected, dragged down by soft domestic demand,”Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, told
Bloomberg. In a speech in Frankfurt last week, billionaire investor George
Soros warned that Germany is heading for a recession of its own
making, which Soros predicts will hit in September. The IMF has trimmed its forecast for US growth, predicting it
will only expand 1.7% instead of the forecasted 2%, according to a
draft of the World Economic Outlook obtained by Bloomberg. The Tiger Index (Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic
Recovery) a sort of ‘pulse rating’ of the global financial
condition,has deemed the
economy""unable to achieve
lift-off and facing the risk of stalling"", according Professor Eswar Prasad, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution. Sell, sell, sell. That is what the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 raw materials indicates Monday's market trend, as the
index has dropped 1.34% on the New York exchange. Silver dipped
more than 11% to $23.93 an ounce in New York, also nearing record
lows. Gold fell below 9.35%, a 30 year lower, below $1,400 an
ounce. “The demise of gold is still at an early stage,”Georgette Boele, a commodities strategist at ABN Amro Group NV told
Bloomberg. Gold first tumbled on the rumored sale of Cypriot reserves as
part of their bailout package. The island-in-crisis planned to sell
excess gold reserves to raise $525 million, which triggered panic
that other indebted euro countries would copycat. WTI crude has fallen to a nine month low , dropping for a second
day to $88.56 on Asian markets and opening under $90/barrel on the
New York exchange. The fall came after the World Bank cut its
economic forecast for China's growth from 8.4% down to 8.3%. With a
US surplus of crude and declining demand, analysts haven’t ruled
out prices below $85 in the coming month. The US currently consumes
21% of the world’s crude oil, and China, 11%.  Iceland and China are expected to sign a trade agreement on
Monday that will boost exports from the tiny isolated island to the
world’s second largest economy. Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir is on a five-day
tour of China, on the lookout to expand its export market after the
banking bubble burst of 2008 left the Nordic economy crippled. A Chinese-Icelandic
partnership is something to watch closely, as Iceland’s proximity
to the melting Arctic is opening up new potential trade routes, and
possibly natural resource exploration -gas, oil, diamonds, gold,
and iron- all resources any up-and-coming superpower should have
its eyes on. President Putin has acknowledged the lagging global crisis, but
at the same time, has suggested that Russia is an anomaly to the
surrounding stunted growth. “The global crisis is acquiring an increasingly dangerous
shape, which inevitably affects us as well,""he said at a
meeting with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Monday. Last year’s
economic performance, by Putin’s account,""was good in
general."" “In contrast to our friends and partners in Europe
andother regions of the world, the Russian
economy demonstrates viability and potential for further
development,""said Putin. Putin reported a wage drop, but stated the figures were above
projected levels, and remains optimistic, boasting Russia’s
extractive industries are due to increase production. Dmitry Medvedev will give a similar follow-up report on April

"6 Apr, 2013",Boao Forum: Chinese convention rivals Davos,"When people hear ‘economic forum’ the first thing they probably think about is Davos and snowy Alps. But that is set to change as China’s Boao hosts the largest and most representative economic summit in Asia. The rapid rise of the so-called ‘Asian tigers’ has shifted the
focus eastwards, when it comes to world economic development.
Initiated by China in 2001, the Boao Forum focuses not only on
Asian economic issues, but also address global political and
economic problems. The 12th Boao Forum in 2013 has already proven to be a truly
global, not just Asian event, once again bringing the world's
attention to the emerging nations' ever growing economic clout. Heads of state, business leaders and Nobel Prize winners,
altogether 1,477 representatives from 43 countries and regions have
all gathered in China to discuss pressing global issues. “This is the largest [economic] forum in Asia,”Ksenia
Yudaeva, Russia's representative for G20 summit preparations, told
RT.“Here you can see that Asia is the new center of world’s
economic growth.” This year the forum is attracting some big names, like
Microsoft's Bill Gates, investor George Soros and head of the IMF
Christine Lagarde. “The vision of that forum is really comparable to Davos in
representation of speakers of Europe, the US and Asian countries. I
would call it an Asian Davos,”said Yudaeva, who also occupies
position of chief of the Presidential Experts' Directorate in
Russia. While Europe and the US are battling economic recession, China’s
trade volume is growing steadily. For many countries China has
already become the number one trade partner, a place previously
occupied by the US. So there is little wonder that world leaders
and business gurus from countries affected by the crisis are
flocking to China’s tropical Hainan Island for some advice and,
hopefully, remedy. Unlike a BRICS summit, which is“largely a government to
government thing,”the Boao Forum serves different purposes,
because it“deepens contact between the civil society, business
and academics”professor of political studies at the University
of Manitoba, Rhadika Desai, told RT. “One really important thing about this is that they are going
to move away from hub-and-spoke relationship that the developing
countries once had with the Western world and the advanced
industrial countries – and began to create more contacts,
investment and trade amongst themselves,”said Desai, who has
written extensively on the rise of emerging economies. The global economic crisis made the Eastern countries realize
that“the best way to deal with crisis is to widen your domestic
market… to engage it a lot more and make it the driver of growth.
This is very important for laying the foundation for sustainable
long-term autonomous [economic] growth,”she stressed. “The old export-led [economic] growth model, which was being
followed and prescribed in the pre-crisis era, is basically
defunct. It could work as long as the US was able and willing to
observe the goods of the Western world, but as we know, it observed
it at the cost of giving excessive crediting to the rest of the
world,”Desai concluded. The BRICS countries have recently signed an agreement to trade
in their own national currencies, not the US dollar. That move is
expected to eventually ditch the American currency. Rumors about
China’s yuan becoming one of the world’s reserve currencies have
been discussed for quite some time already. Washington has for years been accusing Beijing of manipulating
the exchange rate of Chinese national currency to gain some trade
advantages. But China rejects all allegations, demonstrating
resilience in diplomacy and independence in economic
decision-making. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/news/boao-forum-asia-davos-429/
"20 Feb, 2013",Not so precious anymore: Gold losing its shine as global economy spreads its wings,"The price of gold is tumbling and has reached $1609 an ounce which is 10% less than its October high of $1798.10. According to some analysts, the main reason for the fall is
growing economic stability in the world. An improving global
economy reduces the appeal of gold as the safe harbor it is usually
considered as by buyers during harsh times. While the perspective
doesn’t look exactly cheerful right now, with Europe’s recession
deepening in 4Q 2012 as its economy shrank 0.6%, it still seems as
if things are starting to look up. Particularly, the US economy is
raising its head as the Federal Reserve may end its third round of
stimulus measures.  “We’re probably very close to seeing panic lows in the price
of gold,” says Ronald Stoeferle, an analyst at Incrementum
Advisors AG., a Swiss-based financial services firm, in an
interview with The Globe and Mail.  “Generally Central Banks buy gold as a defense against
hyperinflation. However, at the beginning of 2013 there was no
sharp increase in inflation, which did not meet investors'
expectations. As a result, investors and Central Banks started
cutting their positions in gold, which led to the price falling.
However, if inflation in Europe, the United States and China grows,
gold prices might start climbing again in 2Q 2013,” Andrey
Shenk, an economic analyst from Moscow based Investcafe, told
RT.  Another fact that triggered the fall of the precious metal’s
price was the liquidation of a large part of the gold held by major
speculators, including billionaire George Soros who cut his holding
in one of the major gold investment funds by nearly $100 million in
the fourth quarter of 2012.  Gold demand has also been weak in two major markets of the
world, China and India. In China all business was put on hold
during the Chinese New Year holidays last week. In India where gold
has traditional cultural uses less is being sold due to high import
taxes introduced by the government in an effort to improve the
country’s trade balance.  As of now,the world's biggest buyer of goldis Russia as its
Central Bank acquired 570 metric tons during the last decade, an
amount almost triple the weight of the American Statue of
Liberty.  “Russia's numbers are no surprise, as the country is a big
gold producer. As an export-oriented country it needs large gold
and foreign currency reserves to balance the books, and it is more
efficient to buy gold on the domestic market. Thus, during the last
decade Russia has been buying around 60-70% of the gold it produces
for its gold reserves,” Shenk explained to RT.  The metal was perceived as an economic buffer and also proven a
sound investment and opportunity for the Russian state to make
money, with gold prices crawling upwards over the past 12 years,
gaining 12% in 2012 alone, though the tables could be turning right
now. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more. ",https://www.rt.com/business/gold-down-economy-stability-138/
"11 Feb, 2013","Russia emerges as world's top gold buyer, adding 570 metric tons in last decade","Over the last decade Russia’s Central Bank acquired 570 metric tonnes of gold. The amount is almost triple the weight of the American Statue of Liberty and makes Russia the world’s biggest buyer of gold. The amount is a qurter more than runner-up China, Bloomberg reported on Monday.Countries like Russia and China use such stockpiles as an economic buffer against another wave of economic crisis or US dollar devaluation, as both remain weary of the US Federal Reserve’s stability and prefer to edge their bets on gold. It’s also proven a sound investment and opportunity for the Russian state to make money, with gold prices crawling upwards over the past 12 years, gaining 12% in 2012 alone.  On Monday gold traded at $1650 per ounce and analysts expect the price to keep growing in 2013 to reach $1825 by the end of the year. However French investment bank Natixis dampened the outlook by forecasting a drop in price to $1500 by 2014, Finmarket.ru reports. But the link between high gold prices and falling crude has plagued Russia in the past. In 1998, when Russia defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt, it took 28 barrels of crude to buy an ounce of gold, according to Bloomberg research. Two years later, when Vladimir Putin came to power, an ounce was worth 11.5 barrels. By 2005 the ratio had dropped to 6.5 and that is when President Putin ordered his Central Bank to buy. In just a month the proportion of gold in Russia’s total reserve rose from 2.2% to 3.5%.In 2000 Vladimir Putin inherited a country with 384 metric tons of gold and more than doubled its gold reserve in 12 years – according to official data from World Gold Council, in October 2012 gold made up 9.6% of Russia’s national forex reserve and stood at 936.7 metric tons.However it is still far from its historic high – in 1941 Russia held a record 2800 tons of the precious metal and thanks to these reserves successfully recovered after World War II.Russia’s gold rush still doesn’t mean it tops the list of global gold owners. The United States holds the leading position with 8133.5 tons of gold which make 75.4% of country’s total reserve. Germany runs second with 3391.3 tons and the IMF third with 2814 tons. China and Russia are sitting in sixth and eighth place respectively. China however is suspected of downplaying its actual volume of gold by 3-4 times, Zerohedge news website reports, and prepares to introduce Yuan as world’s reserve currency. Back in 2009 China set a goal to overtake the US in the rankings. When the Chinese Central bank is ready to officially declare its actual gold reserve volume, world markets will experience serious problems, Zerohedge.com believes. Major global investor and consulting adviser to the Obama administration, George Soros also appears to have a golden investment streak. In August 2012 it was reported, Mr. Soros offloaded over a million shares in financial companies and banks and purchased $130 million in gold. His move to sell stocks and beef up on gold, is being interpreted by some as a sign of changing investment strategy in the world market.

"8 Jan, 2013",Europe of discord: What will become with euro in 2013?,"As the European debt crisis shows no signs of ending experts are divided on whether the Eurozone is doomed or the project is viable, even if some of its member drop out of the euro. “The eurozone is headed for deeper, more intense, and much less retractable trouble in 2013. There is no foreseeable way for the region to recover as it exists today in its current form,” economic expert Margaret Bogenrief from ACM Partners told RT.With Greece’s exit from the Eurozone looming and a lack of agreement between EU leaders on crisis fighting measures, the region’s economy was on the verge of collapse several times last year. Root of the Greece In 2012 America’s Citigroup raised the chances of Greece leaving the euro in the next year to 90%.""Over the next few years, the euro area end-game is likely to be a mix of EMU exit (Greece), a significant amount of sovereign debt and bank debt restructuring (Portugal, Ireland and, eventually, perhaps Italy, Spain and Cyprus) with only limited fiscal burden-sharing,” Citigroup said in its July report.Since 2009 when Greece’s economy began falling apart under its huge debt burden the country has been dependent on international rescue loans with a total of €240 billion provided to Athens. As of now, €149 billion have been distributed to Greece from the Troika of international lenders.That hardly solves all of Greece’s problems, and experts seriously considered the scenario of Greece’s default and probable exit from the Eurozone. According to the ECB it would be manageable but very expensive, not only for the crisis-troubled country, but for the whole region.“It would be associated with a loss of growth and higher unemployment and it would be very expensive – in Greece, Europe as a whole and even in Germany,” ECB policymaker Joerg Asmussen said in August.His view is echoed by economic experts. ""Despite Greece receiving a commitment of 2 bailouts (totaling 240 bn euro from the EU, European Commission, and IMF), an implementation of strict austerity measures, and the Eurozone’s agreement to cut the country’s debts by a further 40bn euro, Greece’s debt-to-GDP level is still predicted, as a best case scenario in 2020, to hit 124%,"" Bogenrief told RT.She added: ""The EU has stretched itself to its near limit (in particular by having to request aid for outside sources, such as the IMF) merely keeping Greece (the 15th largest economy in the EU) within its economic borders"".By the end of the year Greece managed to gain back investor confidence. Standard & Poor's ratings agency upgraded Greece’s credit grade to a B-, the highest since June 2011, although the bonds are still at junk status. Athens successfully accomplished a bond buyback, and reduced its debt by €20 billion. Trying to hold control of the economy at the end of 2012 Greece adopted a 2013 budget that involves €9.4 billion of spending cuts, mainly in state wages, pensions and benefits, all of which have already been significantly reduced over the past two years. The decision resulted in strikes and protest across the country. Tough austerity measures have also led to a drastic surge of unemployment – in the third quarter of 2012 it reached a record 24.8%, up from 17.7% during the same period in 2011.Greece’s neighbor Cyprus also found itself on the verge of default, crippled by the losses on Greek bonds. S&P slashed Cyprus' credit rating by two notches to CCC+ last December. Cyprus's request for an EU bail-out, which could amount to €17.5 billion, will be considered by eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on 21 January. Cyprus’s President has already said the international aid could cost the country its financial sovereignty. Earlier in 2012 the island nation got a €2.5 billion loan from the Russian government. Then three major companies provided the government with a €175m loan to stay afloat.European creditors EU, IMF and ECB, said they consider a further reduction of Greece’s debt if the country manages to achieve a significant primary surplus by 2016. Earlier they agreed to cut Greece’s debt by €40 billion, reducing it to 124% of GDP by 2020 from around 190% in 2013. Hard times not over Europe saw its public debt reach 90% of the value of the union's economy at the end of the second quarter of 2012, according to the data provided by Eurostat. Meanwhile the total jobless rate in the eurozone reached a record high of 11.7%, meaning 19 million people in the bloc were out of work with Southern member countries among the worst affected.Experts warn that though the situation in Greece is under better control now, the crisis still poses risk to euro stability.“Unfortunately, the eurozone crisis is likely to remain with us for years to come, sustaining the likelihood of coercive debt restructurings and eurozone exits,” Nouriel Roubini, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business wrote in his article for Project Syndicate in December. “The fundamental crisis of the eurozone has not been resolved, and another year of muddling through could revive these risks in a more virulent form in 2014 and beyond,” Roubini said, citing ‘Grexit’ and probable massive loss of market access in Italy and Spain.So far the debt-stricken countries are determined to continue unpopular austerity reforms which have already resulted in mass protests across Southern Europe throughout 2012. The looming multi-billion bailout for Spain, Europe’s fourth largest economy, has become a major headache for the eurozone. Last September Spain announced its plan for drastic economic reform, and a tight 2013 budget which includes 58% spending cuts and 42% increase in taxes. As the Spanish crisis spread several regions asked for bailout, while Catalonia, the country’s richest region accounting for fifth of GDP turned down “participation in the liquidity fund,” the 18bn euro body set up by Madrid to finance troubled regions and called for independence. Saving the euro In 2012 eurozone countries managed to agree on two ambitious initiatives aimed at keeping the Eurozone afloat – the establishment of a European stabilization fund and a banking union. The two instruments will be operational in various spheres: the European stabilizing fund will offer help to weak economies pumping money from the strong ones. EU has also agreed to appoint the ECB the single regulator for the biggest banks in the euro zone as a step towards a ""banking union,"" or common euro area approach to dealing with failing banks.The only thing which European politicians do not want to do is to let debt-stricken countries carry out free floating. However, here they are pursuing their selfish interests, Chief of the Analytical Department of the IK Grandis Capital Denis Barabanov told the Voice of Russia.""The strong countries of the eurozone are getting big preferences and advantages as the members of the eurozone because on the one hand, they are killing rivalry in weaker countries and on the other hand, they always have a reliable and profitable commodity market, which enables them to sell highly competitive goods within the framework of their union,"" Barabanov said.With all the efforts, even optimistic experts don’t expect the Europe’s economy to recover in the near future.  In its new paper “New Recession in the Eurozone” S&P rating agency suggests the eurozone GDP will shrink by 0.8% in 2012. Growth in 2013 is expected to be zero compared to the earlier forecast of up 0.3%, according to the study.Splitting the eurozone is still considered to be an option by some experts. Billionaire George Soros proposed Germany, Europe’s so far best performing economy, should leave to save the Eurozone, among other options. ""The problem would disappear into thin air,"" as the value of the euro declines and yields on the bonds of debtor countries adjust, CNBC quoted Soros as saying. On the other hand, euro-sceptic and financial consultant Stephan Werhahn, grandson of a statesman seen as the architect of the EU, believes the euro should be limited to a handful of similar northern European countries, the Daily Mail reports. ""Europe will fail' if debt-stricken countries are forced to stick with the euro,"" Werhahn said.However, Italy, Greece and Spain are very unlikely to leave the Eurozone, according to Maksim Zaytsev, senior analyst at Nord Capital Group. “They have made significant progress over the recent months in reducing their budget deficit,” Zaytsev told RT. “Now their budget gaps are lower than 9% – a critical level when countries face problems with debt refunding.”The ECB has also contributed to easing the situation in Europe, he added. “ECB launched a bond-buying program which also supported debt markets,” Zaytsev said. “This program allows the ECB to buy bonds without limits while setting aside some funds to avert a risk of inflation.”  The 700bn euro European Stability mechanism is also very important as it de facto issues euro bonds supported by all.

This year ETF (Gold exchange-traded funds) investors bought 247 tons of gold – more than the annual production of the United States, US Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. Paulson & Co. has a $3.66 billion bet through the giant SPDR Gold Trust. The billionaire raised his stake by 26% in the second quarter and his holding of about 66 tons exceeds the official reserves of countries like Brazil and Bulgaria. Soros Fund Management increased its holding by 49% to $221.7 million in the 3d quarter. That’s after George Soros called gold “the ultimate bubble” and largely dumped his stake in the ETF before gold rose to a nominal high of $1,920.30 per ounce in September. The price of gold has risen for 11 consecutive years. Since the beginning of 2012 it added 11%. The price is expected to grow 20% and reach $1925 by the end of the year, according Bloomberg experts. Analysts believe rallies will continue in 2013 amid uncertainty about the so-called fiscal cliff in the US, as well as the threat of inflation, which is growing due to increased monetary stimulus.""We see gold as insurance against the stupid politicians. Now is a good time to strengthen portfolios of real assets such as gold,"" the CIF of Fiduciary Trust Michael Mullaney told Bloomberg.However, billionaire investor Jim Rogers says the news about investors shifting to gold does not mean good news. “This [the news about investors shifting to gold] covers actions taken 3-5 months ago during the 3rd quarter of 2012. Who knows what is happening now? They could be selling. There is bad news about gold these days,” he told RT.The global demand for the metal in the third quarter fell 11% year on year, according to the World Gold Council.That’s despite Central banks increasing reserves in January – September by 351.8 tons. The Bank of Russia said on Tuesday it increased its reserves by 0.3%, to 936.2 tons in October. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"24 Sep, 2012",USAID looks for ways around Russian ban (Op-Ed),"Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave USAID until October 1 to shut its doors in Moscow. This is an excellent decision by the Russian Government. And Washington’s immediate and virulent reaction only confirms that Russia is right on target. The New York Times next morning on the front page cited American officials who “quickly pledged to maneuver around the Kremlin.” Even before the public announcement, on Tuesday 18 September, US Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and USAID leadership met with their Russian partners. Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of the Golos Association – one of the top recipients of USAID funding – confirmed after the meeting that the agency is “not going to leave Russia completely” and they are “brainstorming” about how to reorganize. In the meantime, Ambassador McFaul announced that “it will take at least a year” for USAID to exit Russia, according to Bloomberg News.Brainstorming on how circumvent the Russian government’s decision – instead of how to pack up faster – is only one more demonstration of Washington’s utter disrespect for another country’s sovereignty. Indeed, there are a number of ways in which USAID can maneuver around its predicament.Funding can be channeled directly from USAID headquarters in Washington to its Russian beneficiaries – no need to go through a Moscow office.USAID funding can be redirected through a great number of other US institutions, beginning with the National Endowment for Democracy and its four mandated institutes; private funds such as MacArthur, Soros’s Open Society Institute, or Freedom House; universities’ Russia programs, etc.To hide the American connection, USAID can channel funding through their partners in Ukraine, Poland or Georgia – for their very active operations in the Caucuses; in this case the money entering Russia will be Ukrainian, Polish or, God forbid, Saakashvili’s.In October last year, USAID signed an agreement with Cisco Systems on joint 50/50 funding of Cisco Networking Academies for Public Service Program. Cisco and other major US corporations may continue running USAID programs.A year ago Michael McFaul announced an initiative to create a new US$50 million fund, essentially an endowment for a private foundation established under Russian law for Russian civil society groups.Washington may use any combination of these and other possibilities. One way to put an end to USAID activities in Russia is not only to close their Moscow office, but to insist on shutting down all USAID programs and funding for Russia. This is American taxpayers’ money – give it back to the American people, use it to help them pay mortgages instead of throwing families out of their homes.Obviously, USAID cannot be allowed to stay in Moscow beyond the set date. This delay will only serve to build up additional infrastructure – people and organizations – to run operations remotely.The main lament of the Western press has been about how hard USAID closure will hit the sick, disabled, mothers, newborns and other children that the agency helps. Well, let’s take a look at USAID leadership to see how well they are suited for healthcare services.Director of USAID/Russia Charles North, according to its official biography is “a 2004 graduate of the National War College, with an MS Degree in National Security Strategy.” Earlier North served as Senior Deputy Director of USAID's Afghanistan and Pakistan Task Force, and helped launch a presidential initiative to support Mexico and Central America in battling organized crime and drug trafficking.In Washington, Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia until last year was Douglas Menarchik: a 26-year career US Air Force officer, Vietnam veteran with 211 combat missions, assistant for terrorism policy at the Pentagon, where he developed the Defense Department's Strategic Plan for Combating Terrorism, military advisor to the vice-president of the United States with a portfolio including terrorism and low intensity conflict. Earlier Menarchik was instructor at the Air Force Special Operations School, teaching combating terrorism and counter insurgency.But that’s not all. If you check Charles North’s bio on USAID site, you will see a new “updated” version that excludes his National War College stint. However, a cached copy of his true biography is still available – and this snapshot shows the page as it appeared on September 14, 2012. Someone was cleaning house a few days before the public announcement.Enough tales about healthcare dispensed by US military and national security cadre. USAID – out. Russia must take care of its own civil society, ill and disabled by itself instead of outsourcing it to Washington. Russia’s shutting USAID operations is also an excellent example for any other country where USAID operatives still work on “winning hearts and minds” of the local population.

"13 Jul, 2012",West's battle for Russian ‘hearts and minds’: NGOs on steroids (Op-Ed),"The Russian Duma has just passed amendments to the Russian NGO law. Russian NGOs receiving foreign funding will now have to register at the Ministry of Justice as an “NGO carrying out functions as a foreign agent”, make public their sources of funding by marking it on the materials they distribute, and report semi-annually to the Ministry of Justice on their activities.This law, a great majority of Russians believe, is long overdue. In the past 25 years, billions of dollars have been pouring into Russia from the US State Department and its subsidiary agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID – nearly $3 billion alone), as well as from so-called “private foundations” like the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, and George Soros’s Open Society Institute. All of these institutions, judging by their activities and leadership’s biographies, have important ties to the US State Department, the intelligence community, Cold War and the “color revolutions”.The goal of all this money was not to express Washington’s generous love of Russia, its culture or its people. In addition to building a loyal infrastructure, it aimed at “winning hearts and minds” – and along the way oil, gas, and military capacity. It has all been about “opening” – “open society”, “open economy”, “open Russia”, “open government” – open for brainwashing, economic plunder, for hijacking Russia’s domestic and foreign policies. Conquest by war is always an option for the US, as we have seen in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and now in Syria. But “victory without war” is cheaper and more effective, as the collapse of Soviet Union has tragically shown. What did Western funding do to the Russian civil society while pursuing military objectives by “peaceful means”? Might it have accidentally contributed to building democracy in Russia? The word “democracy” here is understood in its original sense, as government of the people for the people, not in Washington’s interpretation as a loyal regime subservient to US interest. In fact, the multibillions of Western funding have profoundly distorted Russian civil society. A marginal pro-American group of NGOs that was pumped up with US dollars like a bodybuilder with steroids -it has gained much muscle and shine. Those few Russians willing to serve foreign interests were provided nice offices, comfortable salaries, printing presses, training, publicity, and political and organizing technology which gave them far more capacity, visibility, and influence that they could possibly have had on their own. Money and spin are the only means to promote unpopular ideas, alien to national interests. On the other side is the silent majority of people who is squeezed out of the public space. In Western, and also in Russian media, civil society turns out to be represented by Ludmila Alekseyeva (The Helsinki Group), Boris Nemtsov and Gary Kasparov, rather than by a worker from the Urals, teacher from Novosibirsk or a farmer from Krasnodar Region.Moreover, Russian NGOs not addicted to Western funding are put under serious pressure from Western funders and their local outlets to join the club. Once the Russian organization shows its effectiveness, its leadership receives a call from US Embassy, and an invitation to visit. Money offers follow shortly. If the Russian NGO dares to refuse the bait, one or several mirror organizations are created that, with massive funding and publicity, hijack the subject, fill it out with its agenda and occupy the field. For projects in education, for example, suddenly it will be all Anglo-Saxon models and values. For projects fighting abuse by the police, this fight will be selective and serving to compile incriminatory evidence on loyal officials designed to create hostility to the government in general, rather than truly fighting these intolerable practices. In the field of business associations, one Russian NGO was denounced by a major US-allied corporation for “excessively defending the rights of domestic producers”. No, Western funding does not contribute to strengthening Russian democracy. It only extends the battle field for pro-American forces against patriotic forces. Like steroids, Western funding is injected in the weaker spots of the targeted civil society. Like steroids, it is addictive. Like steroids, it corrupts the mind and body of the political organism. It transforms the target nation into a sick and dependent collaborating entity deprived of independent will, mind, and heart. Russia and other countries subject to Western funding infusions must take charge of their domestic problems. Building a patriotic civil society cannot be outsourced. Democratic processes and national security cannot be outsourced – all the more so to openly hostile governments. These NGO amendments, by correcting an evident gap in our laws, take a major step in leveling the playing field. But this step needs to be followed by further measures that strengthen our national civil societies.

"9 Jul, 2012",Washington’s new tricks on the road to global dominance (Op-Ed),"The latest round of the war against an independent Syria unfolded in Paris last week at the gathering of the “Friends of Syria”. Russia and China very rightly did not attend this “amoral” – in the diplomatic language of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs – meeting. At the meeting western champions of the war insisted on their interpretation of the one-week old Geneva agreements: “transition government based on mutual consent” means “Bashar al-Assad must go”, affirmed French President Hollande.This recent round of pressure highlights two new tactics employed by Washington: word games and an end-run around the United Nations itself.First, the new formula “transition government”. The authoritative Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “regime” as “government” and “change” as “transition.” Thus, for those who reject “regime change,” a euphemism was created that has much better chances to go through.Interestingly enough, this term was promoted by an expert of Russian origin, Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. On June 28, 2012 Trenin published a suggestion in his piece “Syria: A Russian Perspective”: “Russia might be willing to cooperate with the U.S. and other countries if the goal moves towards “transition” rather than “regime change” – what has been dubbed the “Yemen model.”So who is Mr. Trenin? This retired Soviet colonel was a Senior Research Fellow at the NATO Defense College in Rome just before he was recruited in 1993 to join the Carnegie Moscow Center, created the same year by none other than Michael McFaul, the current US Ambassador in Moscow. After nearly 20 years in the pay of the Americans Trenin was rewarded with his current post as director by his former boss, Rose Gottemoeller, who left Moscow in 2008 to join the State Department where she is now Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security. Big shoes to fill for Mr.Trenin, but in Washington they know how to pick their cadre.The board of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington features – this world is truly small – Kofi Annan himself. Among the Endowments “Funders and Supporters” are George Soros’s Open Society Institute, the US National Intelligence Council, the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Defense Department, and a collection of other private and public enthusiasts.Of course the “transition government” and “Yemen model” are nothing other than “regime change.” Honestly: we, Russians, brought up on Tolstoy and Chekhov, should be able to miss Washington’s elementary-school semantic traps.Secondly, unable to push anti-Syrian resolutions through the UN Security Council due to Russia and China’s staunch resistance, Washington is building up a group of more than hundred nations more pliable to US pressure. Such “coalitions of the willing” have been put together before, but this time the number of countries makes it look like a parallel anti-UN construct acting as if it is replacing the UN General Assembly itself.Such a gathering, despite total absence of legitimacy, is not just a talking platform. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told “Le Parisien” that the Paris meeting would push for a Chapter VII United Nations resolution to enforce the transition plan. A Chapter VII resolution can authorize the use of military force ""to maintain or restore international peace and security.""In the short term, the United States may attempt to institutionalize this ad hoc grouping into a mechanism to implement a “final solution” to President Al-Assad. In the long term, Washington may try to solidify such structure into an anti-U.N. body of sycophants, ready and willing to approve any U.S. initiative.Now, from tactics to strategy. Looking at the type of leaders that are seizing power in the Arab world with American assistance, a normal person is perplexed: why does the United States, with assistance of their local satellites, keep on removing moderate secular governments and bringing to power, in one country after another, increasingly radical extremists – that same type of people who committed 9/11, the greatest tragedy in U.S. post-WWII history?Indeed, this question is not solvable by listening to Washington’s official line of arguments. But take a look at the policies of the US and its European partners during the in the 1930s. Then, America and its ever so reasonable and civilized European allies provided the financial, industrial and political support encouraging the highly energized, violent extremist Nazi and fascist movements in Europe. With a purpose: to direct its violence against Russia. According to the plan, Germany and Russia were to exhaust themselves so that the US would emerge dominant.Similarly, the earlier use of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and again today the encouragement of various Muslim extremists including elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are part of the plan to create a regional movement which could be thrown against Iran, Russia and China. Such a furnace of war and chaos in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia will permanently disable all three of America’s strategic rivals and allow Washington to rise to uncontested world domination. We should be able to decipher not only US language, but also US strategy. In the 1930s, the Soviet Union was at the front line of the fight against Fascism in Europe. Today, Russia owes it to its history and to the fallen in the anti-fascist struggle to recognize and before it is too late avert American designs. We must prevent Russian and other people from being drawn into a bloodbath of mutual extermination in the voracious interest of Washington’s drive for global hegemony.

"2 Jul, 2012",Russian rights activists oppose ‘foreign agents’ label,"If Russia passes a new law regulating the practice of non-government organizations receiving foreign grants, the Moscow Helsinki Group will refuse to be registered as ""a foreign agent,"" the head of the Group told Interfax on Monday. ""They may close us down if they want,” Lyudmila Alexeyeva said. The Moscow Helsinki head said she would consult lawyers in order to avoid the requirements of the law if it is passed.""As a founder and chairman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, I declare that the Moscow Helsinki Group will not get registered as a foreign agent under any circumstances,"" she said. Foreign donors, including the European Commission, USAID and the MacArthur Foundation, are among those groups that contribute to the Moscow Helsinki Group.According to United Russia State Duma deputy Aleksander Sidyakin, one of the amendment's initiators, the suggested changes would require that all NGOs registered within Russia but receiving money or property from foreign sources – state and private alike – be considered “foreign agents” once they get involved in political activities.Amendments to the NGO law concerning the ""foreign agent"" status will be considered by the State Duma in a first reading at the end of this week, Speaker Sergei Naryshkin told reporters.Earlier, the leader of the For Human Rights watchdog, Lev Ponomarev, wrote in his blog that he was not going to allow the “derogatory brand of a foreign nation’s agent” to be assigned to his group and that he hoped for support from other Russian NGOs.Meanwhile, the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov has also expressed his opposition to the suggested amendments saying that if they are signed into law even the Russian Orthodox Church would fall into the category of a ""foreign agent."" Fedotov went to question the relevance of ""financial transparency"" if the NGO in question was engaging in legal activities.""If this is financial transparency, what is the difference between foreign funds and internal ones,"" Fedotov mused. ""If the organization is engaged in legal activities what is the difference if it is financed by Soros’s fund or Potanin’s fund?""""And if we are talking about illegal activities, if such organization teaches suicide bombings, I have a question – what is the difference if it is financed by foreign terrorist structures or domestic ones?” he added.The head of the State Duma Security Committee, Irina Yarovaya replied to Fedotov's concerns, saying in a media interview that the church is not a non-government organization and thus the amendments cannot be applied to it. She also added that much stricter rules apply for NGOs that work in the United States.The State Duma may be taking its cue on regulating NGOs operating in the Russian Federation from the United States. In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested a group of Russians for operating as agents “of a foreign government without notifying the US Attorney General.”Alexeyeva rejected the claim that her NGO works on behalf of “agents of foreign states.” “We protect our citizens when their rights are breached,” she continued. “We do not work for foreign states.”Alexeyeva said she made a similar statement to Chairman of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov.Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"23 Feb, 2012",Argentine advice for Greece: ‘Default Now!’,"Here in Argentina, when we watch the terrible things that are happening today in Greece, we can only exclaim, “Hey!! That’s exactly what happened in Argentina in 2001 and 2002…!” A decade ago, Argentina too went through a systemic Sovereign Public Debt collapse resulting in social turmoil, worker hardship, rioting and street fights with the police.  Some months before Argentina exploded, then-President Fernando de la Rúa – forced to resign at the height of the 2001 crisis – had called back as finance minister the notorious pro-banker, Trilateral Commission member and Rockefeller/Soros/Rhodes protégée Domingo Cavallo. Cavallo was the gruesome architect of Argentina’s political and economic capitulation to the US and UK when he was President Carlos Menem’s foreign minister and economy minister in the ’90s. Menem and Cavallo are primarily responsible for Argentina’s signing of a formal Treaty of Capitulation with the UK/US after the 1982 Falklands War, opening up our economy to unrestricted privatization, deregulation and grossly excessive US Dollar-indebtedness, almost tripling our sovereign debt in a few short years (see my February 11, 2012 article British Laughter in the Falklands).  The Plan? Prepare Argentina for planned weakening, bankster take-over and collapse, so that a new weakening-takeover-collapse cycle could begin.   In 2001, Cavallo was back to finish his work…During that very hot summer in December 2001, true to its Latin temperament, Argentina even had four (yes, 4!) presidents in just one week.  One of them, Adolfo Rodriguez Sáa, who only lasted three days, at least did one thing right, even if he did it the wrong way: he declared Argentina’s default on its sovereign debt. All hell broke loose! The international bankers and IMF did everything they could to break Argentina’s back; global media pundits predicted all kinds of impending catastrophes. Debt default meant Argentina would have to weather the pain and agony alone, being cast out by the “international financial community”. But no matter how bad it got, it would always be better to do that without the bankers, without the IMF’s, European Central Bank’s, US Fed’s and US Treasury’s “help”.  Better to sort out your mess on your own, than to have parasitic banker vultures carving out their pound of flesh from your nation’s decaying social and economic body.And how bad did it get in 2002? A 40 per cent drop in GDP; 30 per cent unemployment; 50 per cent of the population fell below the poverty line; dramatic, almost overnight, devaluation against the US Dollar from 1 peso per dollar to 4 pesos per dollar (then it tapered down to 3 pesos per dollar); if you had a US dollar Bank account, the government forced you to change it into pesos at the rate of 1.40 pesos per dollar.What did Argentina’s government do wrong?  In the months leading to collapse it bowed to all the bankers and IMF-mandated measures and “recipes”, which were actually the very cause of collapse: Argentina was loaned far more than it could pay back….  And the banker knew it!  This was described in our December 19, 2011 article, Argentina: Tango Lessons.  Successive governments since then have continued to be functional to banker interests by rolling over debt 30 to 40 years, aggregating huge interest and in 2006 paying the full debt to the IMF – almost US$10 billion in full, cash and in US dollars (sole entity given most-favoured creditor status). Today, Greece is confronted with a similarly tough decision.  Either it keeps its sovereignty, or it capitulates to the “Vulture Troika” – the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund – who work for the Bankers, not the People.Not surprisingly, today we find that Greece too has a Trilateral Commission Rockefeller/Rothschild man at the helm: Lucas Papademos who is doing the same things Argentina did in 2001/2.    Argentina not only suffered Cavallo, but President De la Rúa himself was co-founder of the local Global Power Masters lobby, CARI – Argentine International Relations Council – local branch of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, networking with the Trilateral Commission / Bilderberg mafia.Greece today should do what Argentina did a decade ago: better to endure pain and hardship, and sort out the mess made by your politicians in connivance with international bankers on your own, wielding whatever shred of sovereignty you still have than allowing the Banker Vultures sitting in Frankfurt, New York and London decide your future. Or do you think it’s just bad luck, bad judgment and coincidence that countries – Greece, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Iceland, Ireland, Russia, Malaysia, Ukraine, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, France, even the US and UK – always borrow too much from the bankers and then “discover” that they cannot pay it back and that, symmetrically, the same bankers – CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche, Commerz, BNP, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorganChase, BBVA lend too much to countries and then “discover” they cannot collect?No!  That is the very yellow-brick road that leads to the Emerald City of  “debt restructuring”, “debt refinancing”, and “sovereign debt bond mega-swaps” that snowball sovereign debt, spreading it over 20, 40 or more years into the future. That guarantees unimaginably colossal interest profits for the Mega-Bankers and for all those nice politicians, media players, traders and brokers, without whom that would not be possible.This is a Model.  It must keep rolling and rolling and rolling… As this Monster Machine steams forwards, it completely tramples on, overruns, destroys, flattens and obliterates people, jobs, workers, health services, pensions, education, national security and just about everything human on its path.  Run by parasitic usurer technocrats, it does not care what it destroys because it has no ethics; no Christian, Muslim or Buddhist morals.  It only worships a greedy golden idol of money, money and more money.  This is 21st-century Money Power Slavery.  Three generations of Argentines saw hopes dashed and dreams thwarted by this Monster Machine, suffering the hardship, woes and humiliations that come when countries give up sovereignty. So, Greece: Just default on your “sovereign debt”!  Just revert to the drachma!  Just say “No, thanks!” to the German bankers and the Troika Vultures.   Please, Greece: just say “No!” to your Trilateral Commission president!   You will be setting a strong precedent for your European neighbours.  Like Spain, which is hurting so badly right now for similar reasons.  Like Italy, with its Trilateral Commission Prime Minister Mario Monti (also Trilateral’s European Chairman!).  Greece, the Cradle of Democracy, can teach the world a lesson in True Democracy by kicking these parasites out of the country, which will hopefully trigger kicking them out of Europe and one day, kicking them out of the global economy. Because what Greece and Argentina and Italy and Spain suffer today is not True Democracy, but rather a distorted bastard imitation that systematically yields control to the Global Power Masters at the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg and Mega-Banking Overworld.  They run the whole “democracy show”, whereby all countries end up having “the best democracy that money can buy”… which is no democracy at all…  The Money Power juggernaut is steaming full speed towards us all.  If Greece falls, who’ll be next? Spain? Italy? Portugal? Argentina (yet again!!!)? So what if Greece’s reverting to the drachma marks the beginning of the end for the euro?  Let Italy revert to the lira, Spain to the peseta, Portugal to the escudo…!  A National Currency is a key National Sovereignty factor.All governments should understand that you either govern for the people and against the bankers; or you govern for the bankers and against the people.

"15 Aug, 2011",Dining on the Euro’s near death experience,"Take a currency, one widely used as a reserve currency, including by Russia, and expose it to the blowtorch of market examination of its fundamentals.  It isn’t pretty, and the Euro may be gone soon, if it the debt issue isn’t comprehensively addressed. On the Menu – memories of fellow leaders pastTomorrow’s meeting between Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy will go a long way to determining the future of the Euro.The simple question on the menu is whether they can put together the politics to save the Euro.The politics isn’t easy.Almost every European leader from Papandreou in Greece, to the leaders in Ireland and Portugal who have introduced austerity, before heading to the electoral dustbin barely avoiding being tarred and feathered by their not so thankful electorates, and Spain where the election has been called, through to Berlusconi in Italy where the austerity is about to unfold, has shown where the politics is profoundly difficult.But the finances are equally so.After the bailout of Greece (twice) Ireland and Portugal the existing EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility), which was setup with a €440 billion – now needs to encompass the possibility of coming to the aid of Spain, Italy, almost certainly Cyprus (which seems to have gone under the radar, but has a banking sector far bigger than its size would indicate and is surprisingly closely tied to Russia) and maybe other – needs far more.Italy and Spain alone have an estimated €2.2 Trillion in outstanding debt compared to €630 billion for the nations which have already received bailouts.Settling past billsThe initial EFSF is built up through loans from existing Eurozone nations, plus a dollop from the IMF.The nations contributing to it included those receiving bailouts, with nearly 1/3 coming from nations which have either received bailouts, or like Italy and Spain, are in the firing line.That leaves any potential expansion in the hands of the larger or more solvent players, making France and Germany the twin pillars in terms of providing for its enlargement to €2 Trillion, with the need for their contributions to an enlarged EFSF already being factored in by markets, which explains in part some of the tremors in CDS swaps across the Eurozone in recent weeks.They are starting to question even the AAA rated nations of the Eurozone and the implications of what is potentially a massive additional debt servicing need by them, in order to ensure an adequate bailout for the whole Eurozone.To put that in context for theses nations it tends to represent an additional 14-20% of their standing debt, or generally adding about 8% of debt to GDP to their load.Then there are additional concerns with any and every potential bond purchase part of the EFSF, with questions over coupon values, durations, interest rates, and net present values, not to mention how they get accounted for by the nations receiving funds, and how the EFSF marks these to market.Dealing with haughty waitersThe other key factor in the malaise is the structure of the EFSF and its management.It currently revolves around sovereign debt issues if the Eurozone nations individually, and is managed by the ECB.The ECB has been buying bonds of the bailed out nations, plus those, belatedly, of Spain and Italy last week, while at the same time imposing a hard core dose of austerity every time upon the nations, as the price for stepping into the market.Arguments rage back and forth, but there is certainly a case for thinking that in some cases the austerity involved is not just making the life harder in these nations, but largely ensuring they will not see any real economic growth for some time, and as a result further eroding their capacity to service their existing debt.Against a backdrop of the ECB widely being seen as a key factor, through tightening rates too early and too far, in turning an nascent economic recovery into a near certain recession across much of the Eurozone, that is generating plenty of tension from aggrieved politicians having to tout austerity to those who vote for them at the behest of appointed officials.Silvio Berlusconi’s comments about ‘bleeding hearts’ and looking like an ‘occupied government,’ in the wake of getting the Italian parliament to agree to austerity measures on Friday encapsulates a mood which resonates strongly in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.Palatable and unpalatableThe meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel is expected to see the French leader push for the Eurozone to issue bonds backed by all 17 member nations. This would effectively entail the Eurozone developing the fiscal side critics have always maintained it lacks to go with its monetary side.Supporting the contention is the fact that the need to contribute to the EFSF and its enlargement is actually corroding market confidence in the stronger nations, as seen in the market treatment of French banks and French debt in the last week.That brings us back to another round of ugly politics.Germans aren’t terribly enthused about the prospect of bailing out their southern neighbours, and there is a constitutional challenge in Germany to the existing bailout. German resistance to any form of sharing responsibility for sovereign debts of other nations is profound, with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble stating again on the weekend that ""There is no collectivisation of debt or unlimited support.""Germans are also aware that any thought of freeing the ECB from its need to ‘sterilize’ its bond purchases and head off to flood money markets while buying distressed Euro sovereign debt could be highly inflationary, and potentially destabilizing for a nation which has prided itself on rock solid finances – given that it would be required to provide most of the firepower enabling it to happen. The collection of centre right parties which comprise the majority in the Bundestag haven’t been backward in denouncing any hint of easing up for their European neighbours, giving Chancellor Merkel precious little political leeway. Dessert anyone?But writing in the Financial Times on August 14, George Soros sums up the vital role of Germany, and the need for Europe to be able to convince Germany to change its approach if the Eurozone is to survive.“Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany, and because eurobonds will put Germany’s credit standing at risk, any compromise must put Germany in the driver’s seat. Sadly, Germany has unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy, and it wants Europe to follow its example. But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe: no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits. Germany must agree to rules by which others can also abide.”The other side of the equation is that flooding the markets with money, would potentially generate growth in the Eurozone which would lighten the debt servicing issue for those currently looking at exporting people due to the lack of opportunities at home. Currently the ECB doesn’t have the scope for the scale of purchases needed, while ensuring these are sterilized.So that leaves the Eurozone wondering if Sarkozy and Merkel can come to agreement on allowing the ECB to proceed with unsterilized debt purchases, agreeing to issue Eurobonds which would be heavily reliant on Germany, or if they can come up with a system or general idea which they can sell to politicians and publics across the EU that involves fiscal transfers, joint responsibility for existing debts, and will calm markets.For if they come out with nothing more than glib statements, or more of the same it is a recipe for Euro and market chaos.

"13 Jul, 2011",“Hundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis”,"The head of Russia's Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort. RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug-related deaths since the beginning of this year. At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people. How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning. That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed. A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses. The reason for most drug-related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption.RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world's third most heroin-consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq. Some people, such as Mr. Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty. What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government. According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence. For people not involved in gross drug-related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment.RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated. Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world. I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries. Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0.2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders. Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here. Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan's enormous drug production. As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country. This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter.Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000-kilometer border with Kazakhstan. RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe. Mostly it's the Netherlands, where most amphetamine-based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs.The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels.  Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it's nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year. Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs.RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs. Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third-grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical. No, of course not. We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers. After all, people are not born addicted to drugs. It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents. That's when they get to know drugs.If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments. If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment.RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No. We are not talking about forced treatment here. Any forced treatment is a violation of a person. Therefore it’s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves. In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21]. They’re punished, and then they’re released.Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction. However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances. Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment.As I’ve said, this is the so-called alternative responsibility. By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti-drugs fundamental conventions.RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure. Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN. Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in this commission. I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US-Russia Presidential Commission. Mr. Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission. Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere. Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse. Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year. I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr. Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor. All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana. And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized. RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you’ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California.VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign.RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN. I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion. Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech.Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we’ve been discussing at various international platforms. On May 10, I spoke at the G8’s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues. We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding. This concept hasn’t been developed yet.In this context, I want to note that the former Under-Secretary-General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008-2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world’s leading banks. This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production.RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far. It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set. They’ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year.But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000. Now, they are planning to return these 30,000. So, in fact, nothing has changed. I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections.Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least. This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference. It’s longer than World War II. But the situation in Afghanistan hasn’t improved, it has become even worse. And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year. In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times.So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse. It’s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country. So, it’s a kind of closed circle.In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy. The operation was called ‘mashtarak’ which, if translated from Persian, means ‘together’. The operation was presented as a brilliant military success. Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped.That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary. We’ve started talking about this need at long last. It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010. The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement. The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production.I’ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union. Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan. Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan.The EU strategy matches very well a Russia-drafted plan called “Raduga-2” to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan. In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well. So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action. RT: Thank you very much for your interview.VI: Thank you very much. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"14 Apr, 2011",Leading party says Soros prepares “Libyan scenario” for Ukraine,"Ukraine’s leading political party has said that the international financier George Soros has been preparing a “Lybian scenario” for the country. The head of the Party of Regions parliamentary faction Aleksandr Yefremov said in a televised comment on Wednesday that he had information that George Soros had allocated funds for the overthrow of the Ukrainian political authorities.  “I even have information that Soros has allocated certain funds in order to prepare a certain group of young boys here in Ukraine who could launch any existing projects based on the North Africa examples,” Yefremov said. He also added that he hoped that the Ukrainian people will be wise enough not to follow such provocations. The information about George Soros’s involvement in Ukrainian politics was openly voiced by Yulia Timoshenko in 2008. Timoshenko, then the country’s prime minister, said that she was attempting to minimize the effect of the global financial crisis by following George Soros’s advice. This raised suspicions that through such advice George Soros could influence the rate of the Ukrainian national currency in his own speculative interests. Several officials from president Yushchenko’s administration said they wanted to launch a probe into Soros’ Ukrainian activities, but it did not happen. It was only in 2010 that the Ukrainian State Security Service started to check the activities of the Vozrozdeniye foundation, officially sponsored by Soros, and its ties with other Ukrainian NGOs, but this probe gave no feasible results. The Soros Foundation reacted to Yefremov’s statement almost immediately and refuted all accusations. The foundation said in a special statement that all funds allocated for Ukrainian programs are being spent on the development of the open and democratic society and also for helping Ukrainian citizens, who suffered from the effects of the international financial crisis. The statement also said that the accusations of funding some antigovernment activities should be backed by proof and that the policy of the foundation was maximum transparency that left no room for such criticism.

"11 Apr, 2011",Dawn of a new economic era? Soros convenes experts in Bretton Woods,"With emerging economies taking a leading role, a new era could be dawning in the world of global economics. That was one of the main topics on the table at the Bretton Woods conference in the US, hosted by billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The economic theories expounded upon at the conference are ideas that could change the world; the sight of billionaire George Soros, together with PhDs and Nobel Prize winners against backdrop of historical Bretton Woods certainly suggests there is real hope that they will.It was there that the allied nations came together during World War II in crisis searching for stability. They formed the International Monetary Fund and what today is known as the World Bank, and established the US dollar as the global reserve currency.In New Hampshire, decades later in the wake of the latest financial crisis, a group of influential economists and former policy makers have come together to rethink that framework in response to a different world. ""We have got to have a serious plan to reconstruct the international institutions, for the times we are in not the times that are gone,"" says British former prime minister Gordon Brown. By-gone times, says Brown, are the centuries of American and European dominance. With the BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China fueling more global growth, they need a bigger seat at the table.Critics say “in with the new,” should mean “out with the old” orthodoxy of Bretton Woods…and the IMF for one. ""I think the IMF has mainly played a destructive role by promoting financial liberalization in many parts of the world that contributed to the financial meltdown,"" says Professor Gerald Epstein from the Political Economy Research Institute. And handling that meltdown in the United States, with billions going to bail out banks that are still too big to fail, is just one reason some of these critics are questioning the US dollar as the global reserve currency.""If you have crony capitalism and you lose confidence in US institutions, which has happened since 2008, the quality of the dollar and of New York as the financial center can deteriorate very markedly,"" says Robert Johnson, executive director from the Institute for New Economic Thinking.“The problem that has been in a world of flexible exchange rates is that the dollar as the reserve currency gets a special benefit by being the reserve currency. Some of the imbalances don’t get corrected, and basically the US can get away with a lot of things other countries can’t,” Sassan Ghahramani, President and CEO of the New York-based SGH Macro Advisors, told RT. Watch the interview in full.And deterioration in the political will for tough banking reform has some concerned we may be heading for another crisis.""Depends on what one calls a crisis but I would have to say yes – the concentration of power in finance is greater today than it was before this crisis,"" says a former JP Morgan executive. But with mostly western academics talking shop, it is hard to say if the world will come away from Bretton Woods with any new roadmap. According to the man who still has Obama’s ear, his former top economic aid, no one is going to run to Washington and pass legislation next week.  “These kinds of ideas in sphere after sphere have had very important effects,"" said Larry Summers, president emeritus of Harvard University. However, these effects are hard for some to see at this point.“Where is the political will for reshaping the world economy? Who has a proposal that's actually workable? There is plenty of conversation, particularly around the role of the dollar, but no consensus at all on how to replace that,"" says Professor Simon Johnson, MIT Sloan School of Management.It seems there is just consensus on the need for change, and a hope that sage wisdom will not just stay tucked in hills of Bretton Woods.

"10 Apr, 2011",George Soros looks to establish new global finance system,"A new global economic policy is on the table at a meeting in the American town of Bretton Woods. Economists, finance experts and scholars from across the world are gathered at the conference, held by  billionaire George Soros. The chosen venue has great historic significance – this was the setting of the famous Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, which set the monetary system for the world as we now know it.This is where the International Monetary Fund and what is now the World Bank were established, with the US dollar becoming the reserve currency for the world at this same conference.Back in 1944 it was the United Nations that got together the allied countries towards the end of World War II. However, today it is a very different story.This time it is billionaire George Soros bringing together two hundred intellectuals, with the belief that the current economic thinking and the current world monetary policy systems are no longer working.Since the financial collapse shook the globe and reverberated all across the world, there hasn’t been anything to replace the old system, something which might reflect the new world, where the US is not the one singular power that dictates economic policy.The idea among the thinkers in Bretton Woods is that there needs to be a system which reflects the fact that we live in a multi-polar world, a system which brings developing nations into the conversation. Many of those nations with booming economies have become rivals to developed nations such as the United States.“So, you come to 2010, and for the first time virtually for nearly 200 years America and Europe – that’s the United States of America and the 27 members of the European Union, for the first time are being outproduced, outmanufactured and outexported, and also, interestingly, outinvested by the rest of the world,” former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the conference.One of the key problems economists are now facing is the necessity to develop new, more efficient, ways of dealing with enormous financial deficits, particularly America’s skyrocketing debt. The United States is paving the way with more than one trillion dollars of deficit each fiscal year, adding up to more than 14 trillion dollars in debt – a problem which the US political leadership does seem to be eager to deal with. Robert Johnson, the executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, George Soros' think-tank, which is leading the conference, in his opening speech questioned the effectiveness of current financial governance and called for measures to restore trust in the system.“At this time, I do not think people are trusting governments after financial bailouts. I do not think they trust experts by and large… That’s the nature of the problem, that’s why INET was formed,” he told RT.However, Johnson says it is not so easy to come up with a recipe to regain the trust of people who feel betrayed by the billion-dollar bailouts around the world.“I’m particularly concerned about the United States, which is at the center of the world system. The middle class in the United States is feeling compressed. They are experiencing what you might call a social death, while two to three per cent are doing very, very well,” he continued. “Almost all of the gains from 1979 to the present, perhaps more than 100 per cent, have gone to the top one per cent, and that’s just not sustainable, and that is not inspiring of trust.”Commenting on the current situation with the dollar as the world's reserve currency, Johnson said that the prevailing view among delegates at the conference is that the dollar is diminishing in significance for various reasons:“The dollar is diminishing in significance, somewhat for natural reasons, because the United States is the smaller proportion of the world economy, as the emerging countries, like Russia, Brazil, India and China, grow,” he said.At the same time, Johnson continued, the dollar may be suffering from the fact that leaders in the United States have not paid enough attention to strengthening the underlying economic conditions, such as infrastructure, education, scientific research and maintenance of demand.“If you have a damaged and diminished population, damaged infrastructure and… paltry or non-existent investment, you are not going to have a strong economy, and the dollar will be a reflection of that,” Robert Johnson concluded. Gerald Epstein, Professor and Chair of Economics at the University of Massachussetts at Amherst, says emerging countries and financial regulators have much heavier responsibilities in the face of the global financial crisis.“We need global cooperation to get us out of that current crisis, but also to help us to make a transition to a new type of economy where power is more widely dispersed around the world,” he said, “an economy that can deal with climate change and make the green transition that we need.” Roman Frydman, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that the BRICS countries are accounting for an increasingly larger part of world consumption.“US consumption, by some estimates, is expected to go down to as little as 20 percent,” he said. “And Europe will be another 20 percent. And the rest of the world will be about 60 percent. That’s a major, major transformation. And all these countries will play a much bigger role…  in the next couple decades.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"23 Oct, 2010",Gold retains lustre,"The gold price has surged over the course of this year to beyond $1320 an ounce, with investor interest growing as concerns about currencies mount. Gold futures, warrants, gold exchange traded funds, gold-mining shares – there are many ways invest in gold.  But none offer the sheer sense of possession that having a bar in your hands does. Otkryitie analyst, Vladimir Savov says this can allow investors to strip out thinking about company management and hedge books, and simply focus on price. “As stock analysts we tend to focus a lot on companies that produce gold, but for a retail investor when it comes to the share there are a lot more factor to keep in mind, when you think only about gold, you think only about the gold price.” In the wake of the global financial crisis, and with concerns about currencies mounting amidst talk of quantitative easing, investors worldwide have been increasingly look for gold exposure. But if they want exposure in Russia, they need to make sure it stays in the bank as an investment – it attracts 18% VAT once it gets taken out of the vault and becomes a present.  Olga Gryazeva, Head of office, at Sberbank, says gold coins make popular presents. “Russians mostly buy these gold coins as presents, probably because they look nice, however some of them are investment coins and they are not exposed to VAT.” Investment analysts say up to 10% of any portfolio should be in gold, and Vladimir Savov believes that despite a recent retracement, the outlook is definitely. “We do think that we will see higher price in the coming months. Because there is still uncertainty, people look for safe haven, the dollar could be kept at lower levels, and that is good for commodities and gold in particular.” Long term gold bull George Soros recently described the precious metal as the “ultimate bubble,” as the metal is only really used in jewelry and J.M Keynes described it as a ‘barbarous relic’ – but as the oldest store of wealth it still retains a surety that is matched nowhere else – just don’t take it out of the bank if you are buying physical in Russia.

"6 Jul, 2010",“US is building secret bases in Afghanistan for war against Russia” – journalist,"Investigative journalist Daniel Estulin, who has made it his mission to uncover the secrets of the Bilderberg Group, has shared some of his revelations with RT. The Bilderberg Group is one of the most secretive and exclusive clubs that attracts some of the world's most powerful people. Its meetings are invitation only and take place under tight security, away from the prying eyes of the public and the press. Critics of the organization, including Estulin, claim they are deciding international policy in a way that is far removed from democracy. “In Russia you have democracy so it is much easier to infiltrate certain organizations as in the 1990s in an operation called Barbarossa-2. They used the NGOs, the American Aid, the International Monetary Fund, the George Soros Organization to try and actually infiltrate and destroy Russian society from within. Today, the US government is building 13 secret bases in Afghanistan for the forward push to an eventual war against Russia,”Estulin told RT.

"9 Sep, 2009",“The wealthiest in America start to move their money out of the US”,"The U.S. dollar-based post WWII phantasmagorical world of never having to pay your debts is coming to a close, states financial journalist Max Kaizer to RT. RT: You predict America is on the slippery slope to economic collapse. What do you think of America’s national debt levels? Max Kaiser: The American debt levels are outrageous, and the way America gets away with it is by maintaining the world reserve currency as a big part of the American hegemony, or the American empire. When America writes checks or creates bonds to other countries, when those bonds are due, America just creates more bonds. It’s what some call an extraordinary privilege.  And this is why countries like Russia, China and Iran are looking to diverse [sic] themselves, and divorce themselves, from the US dollar. They’re doing more deals amongst themselves, more bilateral deals in their local currencies, their regional currencies. Ultimately, America is a debt-a-holic. RT: What will the consequences of America’s national debt be? MK: I think it’s in the works right now, some kind of a gold bullion backed currency, and the implications for the US are not great, because they have this huge debt, so they will be forced to trade off their debt not by just inflating themselves out of the problem by creating more paper. If the rest of the world becomes more competitive, and the rest of the world starts adopting real sound currencies, the US would also be forced to be competitive to some degree, greater than they currently are. And in a real, fair, competitive race, the US has the weakest currency. If the global economic and business game is a game of poker, the US is holding a terrible hand. RT: What do you think about the Federal Reserve getting more powers from the Obama administration when many blame Fed for the crisis? MK: To use the alcoholic metaphor, it’s like giving an alcoholic more to drink. Hank Paulson and his successor Timothy Geithner are part of the financial oligarchy, a part of the banking oligarchy, their interests are not the same as the interests of American citizens; they have their own interests. They are part of a global banking cartel, the same group of bankers all over the world, who seek to keep interest rates as low as possible, to make it as easy for them to borrow as possible. Because when they make a bad bet, their respective governments bail them out with tax payer money. It’s really a war, there’s a global war going on between investors and speculators. Anyone who’s trying to invest money for a decent return, or work for a decent wage is being squeezed out or pushed out by speculators who have access to cheap money through political connections. RT: Do you believe the American bailout is a form of protectionism? MK: It’s not free market capitalism, it’s an industrial policy; it is a policy of the government wanting to get into every nook and cranny of the business sector, because the people who are in politics and in business want the cheapest possible access to money. They do not want to compete, and the easiest way not to compete is to do business with the government, who has the ability to raise taxes, to confiscate wealth, to wage wars. So, it’s not a coincidence that the primary GDP-boosting activities of America are war, which services the war councils that are on the board of directors of these banks and in Washington, and cheap consumerism, consuming foreign-made goods, slave-made goods in other countries. And again, with the US, it is great if you have a world reserve currency and everyone needs to buy US dollars to conduct their business. This is why countries like Russia, China, Iran and Brazil are trying to divorce themselves away from the US because it is completely toxic currency. It supports an empire that is too lazy to compete, that makes money through cheap consumption and war. The rest of the world is saying: “We want to move away from that model. We want to do something more vibrant, more capitalistic and more dynamic” RT: What is going to happen to this shadow banking system if it keeps on going unchecked? MK: What will happen? There is going to be a currency re-valuation across the globe. The dollar would probably be cut in half versus made of the trading currencies. Gold in particular will have to be, as it was in the 30s, valued upward. Gold and precious metals and any currency that brings in to the basket of commodities or precious metals as the basis of the currency will in concert I believe move 50-60% in one day or one week or may move over 100% in a week. This means that all the currencies will be revalued against gold. And the currency which will lose the most would be the US dollar. So for people like in America, as it happened in other countries – like Iceland recently, or other bail-out countries from the IMF, or in Russia, or in the UK in the 70s – suddenly people wake up and the currency is devalued by 50%. Everything at the store costs double or triple or quadruple and there is nothing they can do about it. Because it’s not like these things happening according to a carefully coordinated plan by the banking establishment around the world that is setting this all up to go. It is going to be practically effortless on their part. I was impressed how Europe embraced the Euro. The logistics of converting all these currencies to the Euro was a pretty amazing job. So think about this new currency grade happening very quickly in all the currencies had a new relative value versus commodities. Of course the US won’t be happy about that but most of the major wealth in the US will be outside of the US by then. RT: You say that people are pulling money out of America. Do you have any data to spot this? MK: The data as you see is in the price of gold bullion for one thing, but all this talk about deflation and GDP is contracting and the economics are slowing down. You still have the price of gold doing very well. You also see the currencies outside the US start to break way from the US dollar. And they are doing pretty well, currencies like New Zealand and Australia start to come back in a huge way. They start to outperform the US right now. The US is standing back a bit, but there are some countries which are doing much better. The Russian Stock market is doing fantastically well. They’ve got resources, good infrastructure, great relationships with China, Iran, Brazil and some other countries. They are positioning themselves as hot assets.The US dollar-based post WWII, IMF, World Bank – a phantasmagorical world of never having to pay your debts is coming to a close. And ones it happens – you want to be on the right side of that trade. RT: Are you prepared to stick out your neck and say by this date will be doomsday for America as you call it? MK: In the US the number that I would look at is the unemployment number, it is continuing to creep up, the wage number is continuing to go down on an hourly basis and even if you want to play with the numbers on employment and unemployment and there’s a lot of ways that these statistics are cooked and arranged, the basic hourly wage number is continuing to deteriorate, so at some point there will be a critical mass of unemployed people in America who will then I think spontaneously, as it happens in other countries, will suddenly have to decide that this is it, that we can’t take it anymore. The honeymoon of Barack Obama seems to be entering a new phase where people are less excited by his program of change because they do not see any change in the banking system and the bankers are still very much pilfering and very much stealing and they want more power. So its tough to say exactly when that spark will hit that ignites the Hindenburg of social unrest in the US but I do not think that at this point you can reverse it, there’s nothing that can be done to reverse this inevitable collision and I think that also one of the amazing stories of 9/11 is how, when the 9/11 disaster hit, is really the beginning when the wealthiest in America start to move their money out of the US. That was what they learnt that the US isn’t really safe for my money anymore and they started to move their money out of US aggressively since 9/11 a lot of the complications and the reason why Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates down to 1 percent after 9/11 was in a large part to assist the wealthiest of America in moving all their capital out of America. RT: Tell us more about the KarmaBanque that you've created. MK: KarmaBanque is like what if Gandhi and George Soros had a love child, basically. What I did was I figured out which companies, if a large boycott were enacted, would have the greatest impact on their share price, which companies’ market capitalization is most weighted toward a consumer boycott that would cause major damage. So a company like Exxon is not particularly vulnerable to consumer boycott, ’cause they’re diversified in many ways, their stock doesn’t trade in the high multiple of retail sales. But a company like Coca-Cola is very vulnerable to boycott. The second turbo-charged aspect to the KarmaBanque methodology, is that if people decide that they’re going to boycott a product like a Coca-Cola, it will have an effect on their revenues and profits. In America, they’re used to the idea of if I like the company, I’ll buy the stock. So this is just the opposite: I don’t like the company, I’m going to boycott the stock to the point where hedge funds start selling short that stock. RT: Some people call you a financial terrorist. How do you respond to that? MK: That would be incorrect. What I am suggesting cannot be considered financial terrorism. It can be considered economics. Because what I’m saying is that a lot of these companies have unrealized risk that’s not reflected in their own balance sheet which is descent risk. I’m making that risk visible, and by making this risk visible and quantifying it should be reflected in the stocks price. Hedge funds and other big institutions like pension funds looking for ways to increase returns to help those people who benefit from their accounts in these large institutes will benefit from this approach.

"24 Jun, 2009",How Western media backs the “green revolution” in Iran,"It was an election that was snatched from the Iranian people – or at least that's the impression being given by Western media outlets. But are they telling the full story? The BBC and the Voice of America radio station have been harshly criticized by Iranian officials who accuse the broadcasters of fueling violence after the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The European Union has rejected Iran’s accusations that the Western media helped engineer post-election unrest as protests in Tehran continue. And US President Barack Obama has also said that Washington is not interfering in Iran's affairs. While strongly condemning the actions of Tehran in curbing the protests, Obama said the United States respects the sovereignty of the country. But Iranians screaming about fraud and demanding a fair election – that’s what most people are seeing on their TV screens. Journalist Jalal Ghazi believes Ahmadinejad won the elections because“the difference is 11 million and you just cannot expect 11 million votes to be forged.” So why does the American media seem to overlook that fact? As the protests continue, some experts still believe there is interference from outside of Iran. A columnist and a former assistant secretary of the US Treasury in the Reagan administration, Paul Craig Roberts, says it's all part of a major destabilization plan ordered by the US. “The CIA has been conducting a destabilization plan within Iran for the last two years; it is well known and has been widely reported in American and British press. We are seeing the fruits of an orchestrated protest that is taking place in Tehran,”said Roberts. “The American media serves as a propaganda ministry for the government,”he added. Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen told RT that the real story behind the media in Iran is that of instigating a “green revolution.” “George Bush funneled $400 million to George Soros’ Open Society Institute and National Endowment for Democracy (NED) institutions to influence this opposition movement against the Iranian government,”Madsen claims.“Every time you hear about revolutions it is George Soros and the Open Society Institute.”  Going further, Madsen argued that“Yesterday, CNN really had trouble with priming itself away from the coverage of demonstration in Tehran to cover a terrible metro train accident in Washington. What is the motivation for all this intense coverage by CNN, MSNBC and Fox News? It seems like there is a coordinated and concerted effort to stir things up using Western media.” Experts are questioning whether or not this may be another US attempt to foment a color revolution in the Middle East, as it has done in past years in Eastern Europe. “There is a tendency now to take advantage of what is an internal problem with the present Iranian government,”Wayne Madsen said.“We see some of the same hallmarks today in Tehran which we saw in Ukraine and Georgia.” Read alsoThe West does not conceal its intention to hold another color revolution in Iran  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"16 Jun, 2009",Billionaire Madoff tied to intelligence agencies,"No conspiracy charge by feds against Madoff is covering up links to domestic and foreign intelligence. The failure of federal prosecutors to bring conspiracy charges against Bernard Madoff, the mega-billion dollar Ponzi scammer who pleaded guilty March 12 to eleven counts of fraud and other crimes in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, is providing cover to those who pulled the strings on Madoff's illegal operation.  WMR spoke to a former close aide to Madoff who related how he handled a number of transactions personally for Madoff. The source said that Madoff was running a special type of ""pump and dump"" scheme. The source said Madoff would""pump money out of the system and dump it out to another place.""When asked what that ""other place"" was, the source replied,""Israel."" The source believes that no conspiracy charges were brought by the federal government against Madoff because it is the government and not necessarily Madoff that is trying to protect his ""network and superiors."" Madoff's Chief Financial Officer was Frank DiPasquale, who is being represented by Marc Mukasey of Bracewell Giuliani. Mukasey's father is former Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey. The U.S. judge handling the Madoff case, Denny Chin, is, according to informed legal sources in Manhattan, over his head in corruption. WMR has learned how some of Madoff's international operations were conducted. At 3:30 pm every day Madoff Investment Securities employees would call banks in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, and tell them to ""roll the accounts."" That was insider language for ""lend the money."" In some cases, money was moved to the Belize Bank, which was described by a Madoff insider as a ""back side"" for secretive banking operations in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland. Madoff would also dispatch messengers to 55 Water Street in New York's financial district to pick up securities bearer bonds that could fit into an ""Army duffle bag."" Those types of transactions dramatically decreased for Madoff after 9/11. The weekend following the Fourth of July, Madoff would sponsor a three-day bash for Madoff employees and ""special guests"" at Montauk on the eastern tip of Long Island. One of Madoff's special guests was Norman F. Levy, a billionaire who Madoff considered as a father figure. After his death, Levy's old firm continued to maintain an office at 885 Third Avenue in Manhattan, the same location as Madoff's firm. A Madoff insider speculated that Madoff may have been using Levy's company as a conduit for his business activities. The annual Montauk conclave featured a dinner for Madoff's ""special guests"" on the Saturday evening at the Montauk Yacht Club. Madoff's ""special guests"" were kept segregated from the regular Madoff employees. The special guests were often found in a special place called the ""money fund room."" In addition to Madoff's immediate family members, including his brother Peter, he also tended to surround himself with key individuals who were veteran officers of the U.S. military. Madoff's London operation was handled out of a one-room small office located at 43 Newell Street. Every time Madoff visited the office, the London staff was extremely nervous. According to a Madoff insider, the Madoff London office was nothing more than a ""front"" operation. There may have also been some synergy between Madoff's London operations and American International Group (AIG), which reportedly is missing $500 billion from a similar small office pass-through operation in London. Madoff's number one foreign destination was not England but France, where he maintained a luxurious estate in Provence. Madoff routinely got his cash from the Bank of New York (BONY) and Chase. One favorite Bernie Madoff term was an ""inch of fifties,"" which equates to $5,000. The day before Madoff was arrested, he sent a ""package"" to Citibank's private banking facility at 850 Lexington Avenue. Usually when Madoff Securities sent out a ""package,"" a set of documents in an 8 1/2 x 11 inch envelope authorizing electronic funds transfers, there was always a signed receipt from Citibank. One exception was ""packages"" personally sent by Madoff to Citibank. On December 10, Madoff sent a ""package"" to Citibank with no receipt from the private banking service. That evening Madoff attended the company's annual Christmas party, which had always been held on December 17. Madoff was reportedly not acting normal and his wife Ruth was trying to play the gregarious role normally handled by Madoff in previous parties. WMR's inside source believes that Madoff knew then that he was facing arrest the next day. WMR has also learned that Madoff Securities was for sale in the late 1990s. One of the names mentioned in the potential sale is Ezra Merkin, also under investigation by the federal government's probe of Wall Street. WMR has learned that Madoff almost sold his firm for $1 billion. The potential purchaser, who was not identified, flipped a coin between buying Madoff or Charles Schwab. The purchaser opted for a potential purchase of Schwab. Madoff often had a tense relationship with his family associates. In the mid-1990s, WMR was told of a particularly nasty exchange between Bernie and his brother Peter. Bernie allegedly told his brother,""When you see your name on the door, you can tell me what to do. Until then you have one percent of the stock so you can keep your fucking mouth shut."" When Peter's son Roger died of cancer at the age of 30, a cancer fund was established in Roger's name. Our source said that the fund for Bernie Madoff's late nephew was also defrauded. The source said,""Bernie would never do that to his nephew,""adding,""Bernie was operating a ""pump and dump"" scheme for a domestic and foreign intelligence agency.""Asked to name the domestic agency, the source replied,""CIA.""Asked about the foreign agency, the source claimed it was""the Russia-Israeli mob operating with Mossad.""It is also reported that a number of key Madoff employees died suddenly from various causes, including what was described as ""fast-acting cancer."" The cancer victims included Madoff's 55-year old in-house lawyer and his ""mid-fifties"" computer software engineer. The woman who created Madoff's over-the-counter stock trading system was struck and killed by a bus while walking to Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. One long-time Madoff employee told WMR that Bernie Madoff's father, Ralph Madoff, who worked as a New York plumber, once told the employee,""Never, never invest in Wall Street cause it's run by crooks and SOBs.""Ralph Madoff told the employee to take his money and ""buy books."" In Bernie Madoff's case, the apple fell extremely far from the tree. As a postscript, someone who worked with Madoff told WMR that he does not expect his old boss to live until his sentencing in June. The ex-employee believes that Madoff will not physically survive prison for very long. Given Madoff's extensive and murky intelligence links, there is every reason to believe the ex-employee is making the correct prediction. More on Madoff operation emerges from insiders – WMR has been informed by former Madoff Investment Securities sources that jailed Ponzi scammer Bernard Madoff's wife Ruth revealed as early as September 2008 that her husband was ""under great stress."" However, the source also revealed that Mr. Madoff ""thrived under great stress."" FBI investigators reportedly asked Madoff employees, after Madoff's arrest on December 11, 2008, whether Madoff had been ""acting strange"" before the arrest. Employees were also asked to provide the FBI with a psychological profile of Madoff. A Madoff Investment Securities insider told WMR,""Bernie's mission was to keep the company he created alive with infusions from strangers. They turned out to suffer collateral damage.""The source added,""Bernie could not give customers bad news."" Madoff insiders also described how the Ponzi scammer formed his company in 1961. Madoff began his firm with a mere $5,000 in capital. Madoff was not able to gain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because of the prohibitive cost of $250,000. Bypassing the NYSE, Madoff developed over-the-counter (OTC) trades and ""back doored"" trading into the NYSE. Madoff first used card punch machines in the OTC process, progressed to magnetic tape computers, and then employed newer, state-of-the-art technology. WMR also learned that the computer systems engineer for Madoff who developed Madoff Investment Securities computerized trading system used proprietary software and, more oddly, proprietary hardware. In 1999, Madoff initiated the development of a top secret new trading system called Primex, which attracted the interest of NASDAQ, where Bernard Madoff served as chairman and his brother Peter had previously served as a board member. The computer engineer died a few years ago in her mid-fifties of what was described by a colleague as a ""fast-acting"" cancer. WMR learned that Madoff was somewhat incensed about the high cost of gaining a seat on the NYSE. Actor Rick Jason, who co-starred with Vic Morrow in the TV series ""Combat,"" actually had a seat on the NYSE that was bought for him by Jason's father. That made Madoff all the more determined to bypass the expensive NYSE seat requirement to carry out trades. Jason reportedly shot himself to death on October 16, 2000. When Madoff was considering selling his firm to an unnamed suitor in the late 1990s, WMR was told by a firm insider that one reason Madoff was hesitant to sell was that even during that time frame he was concerned that if his company's books came under scrutiny from a sale that the company would ""crash."" WMR also learned that a close associate of one of Madoff's top corporate officers was involved in trying to obtain a U.S. State Department contract for Halliburton, the firm once headed by former Vice President Dick Cheney. The individual in question reportedly was working with Halliburton's office in Baghdad, Iraq. A Madoff firm source also revealed to WMR that American International Group's (AIG) London office, which reportedly lost some $500 billion, was engaged in an ""economic warfare"" scheme against countries of the former Soviet Union. The operations coincided with the funding by George Soros of various campaigns to oust governments in Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and even Russia itself. WMR also learned additional details of events that transpired the day before Madoff was arrested, December 10, 2008. Madoff unusually switched his firm's annual Christmas Party from its normal December 17 date to December 10. Not only was that seen as unusual by Madoff employees but so, too, was the fact that Madoff's two sons, Andrew, who ran a spin-off called Madoff Energy, and Mark, were not present at the party. Earlier in the day, both had reportedly spoken to FBI agents about their father's Ponzi scheme activities.

"6 May, 2009",Is Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili only pretending to be nuts?,"Georgia’s first provocation against Russia came on the eve of the Olympic Games; the latest on the eve of NATO games. Now, Russians are anticipating what gift to expect from Tbilisi on New Years Eve. Since the moment Mikhail Saakashvili became Georgia’s president in January 2004, he has been singularly obsessed, like some sort of modern-day Napoleon Bonaparte, with one grandiose idea: expanding his Caucasian fiefdom irrespective of the cost at home and abroad. Just months after being sworn into office, Saakashvili’s campaign of lebensraum enjoyed early success when his troops seized control of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic, a small coastal region. After splashing around on the beach in Ajaria following the bloodless takeover, Saakashvili told the assembled crowd,“This paves the way for Georgia’s prosperity… It will be the beginning of Georgia’s territorial integrity.”  Historians, however, and more than one psychiatrist, could cite a long list of other wannabe world conquerors who were seduced by delusions of grandeur after gobbling up a little foreign real estate before going on to menace their peaceful neighbors. Unfortunately for Russia, this proved to be the clinical case with Mr. Saakashvili. In August 2004, and still in a triumphant mood after his Ajaria beach-storming, the Georgian president fired a wild shot across Russia’s bow by threatening the 7,000 Russian tourists who annually vacation in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. “I earlier ordered,”said the Georgian Nappy,“that we should immediately open fire on, and sink, every ship [cruise ships included] that enters Abkhazia.” Can anybody recall the last time a world leader, no matter how ideologically agitated or mentally unhinged, ordered his troops to deliberately target boats carrying innocent tourists? In some places of the world, this is called piracy. I fail to recall even Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saying anything so incredible, and he has said some really incredible things. Why, even the Mexicans tolerate chubby Americans wading around in their hotel pools and nude beaches, and the Mexicans lost a lot of real estate in the past to Uncle Sam. Yes, Mr. Saakashvili, the English-speaking Columbia grad who rode the wave of the Rose Revolution on a surfboard paid for courtesy of the American philanthropist and political meddler, George Soros, specifically told Russian tourists to “pay attention” to his words. Well, I’m not sure if Russian tourists paid much heed to the alarming caveat, it’s hard to keep Russian tourists away from most places these days, but the Russian authorities certainly did. “Russian citizens have the right to choose where they want to go on holiday,”the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “Any attempts to threaten the lives of Russian citizens will receive the necessary rebuff.” At this point, Moscow’s unofficial medical diagnosis of the Georgian president’s general state of mind, to roughly translate the Russian saying, was one horse shy of a full troika.   As previously mentioned, Saakashvili’s foreign policy was built on the wobbly foundation of achieving two goals: gaining control of South Osseta and Abkhazia, two territories that have historically remained de facto autonomous regions, with their own unique histories, cultures and languages, despite being absorbed into the Russian empire, and later, the Soviet Union. History finally came to a boiling head in 1991-92 during the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict. After spilling a river of blood that witnessed thousands of refugees fleeing the region from all sides, a Moscow-brokered ceasefire was imposed. The deal saw Russian peacekeepers stationed on the active fault line between the two hostile camps. The fragile peace was shattered during the night of August 7-8, 2008, on the very eve of the Olympic Games in Beijing, when Georgia launched a large-scale attack on Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, killing hundreds of citizens, as well as 12 Russian peacekeepers. Georgian forces were eventually repelled, and over the course of the 5-day war, the Russian offensive advanced deep inside of Georgian territory. The entire world was on the edge of its seat, not knowing to what extent Russia would “punish” Tbilisi. But as wild as things were getting on the ground in Georgia, the really crazy war was happening on television screens across the world, with an assortment of talking heads blaming Russia for the conflict. But thankfully, the world also got to see a side of the Georgian president that many had not seen before. After all, there are some personality traits that are a bit difficult to censor. In the heat of the battle around Gori, one of the Georgian towns seized by Russian troops, Mr. Saakashvili was filmed stepping from a vehicle, where it appeared he was going to give an interview with some reporters. Suddenly,apparently overcome with fearat the sight and sound of an imaginary Russian aircraft overhead, Saakashvili made a rather comical dash for cover around a building, with his gun-toting security team – and news cameras – in hot pursuit. They wrestled the president to the ground amidst loud screams and shouts, bundled him back into the vehicle, and sped off. Okay, perhaps we could give Mr. Saakashvili the benefit of the doubt on this one. I mean, after all, war is no picnic, of course, and who wouldn’t get a little freaked out at the thought of an enemy fighter jet aiming its big guns at you in the middle of an interview? But this next one is a bit more difficult to explain as the act of a person in full control of his mental faculties. After a ceasefire was announced between Georgian and Russian troops, BBC, which was preparing to run an interview with the president (who probably got more television coverage in his 5-day Ossetian war than Winston Churchill got in his four-year European war), caught Saakashvili unawares as he wasnervously munching away on a perfectly good necktie, eyes shifting side to side, while chatting on the telephone. But even with the ugly dog days of war in the rearview mirror, Saakashvili continues to behave extremely irrational whenever Russia is concerned. On Tuesday, for example, 500 members of a tank battalion stationed at Georgia’s Mukhrovani base, which lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of the capital, mutinied by announcing that they would refuse to participate in operations to break up political protests being held by the opposition. After arresting the soldiers, and putting out rewards for the leaders who escaped, the Georgian Interior Ministry said it had uncovered a Russian-financed plan to topple Saakashvili’s already tenuous hold on power. So now Russia is accused of commandeering Georgia’s own army! What next? Apparently, even Saakashvili understood how absurd was the allegation and the Georgian authorities quickly changed the story, saying that the mutiny was aimed at disrupting NATO exercises. Incidentally, the Georgian opposition, of which there is a growing number, believes Saakashvili staged the failed military coup“to discredit the opposition,”said Irakly Batiashvili, a former Georgian state security minister and now an opposition leader, as reported by Interfax. Stop the presses! This just in hot off the wires: Saakashvili on Wednesday reportedly told a meeting with his Joints Chief of Staff that Georgian counterintelligence agents arrested a spy at the Georgian diplomatic mission to NATO in Brussels on charges of passing“information on the stationing of Georgian troops to the enemy during the August war last year.”The presumed ""super-spy"" was allegedly paid just 3,000 euros for passing the top secret information to Russia. Is it possible that such information would be given away at such a discount? Furthermore, if Russia never heard of Google Maps, it certainly has its own highly developed satellite technology. During last year’s Valdai conference, which brings together western journalists and top-ranking Russian politicians, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev asked a very pertinent question that needs repeating now: “Does NATO need such a leader?” Robert Bridge, RT  RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"8 Apr, 2009",Investors position themselves for longer term gains in stocks,"Memory of the rebound in Russian stocks in the late 1990s is helping some investors position themselves for what they see as a likely rise later this year, despite the recent gains being seen as a bear market rally. 2009 has become a new beginning for the Russian stock markets.  After several years of increasing interest by global investors, the market collapse of late 2008 currently sees it almost devoid of foreign investors and based almost solely on Russian funds.  But longer term players have seen this before – after the collapse of 1998.  And like then, when it grew 3 fold in a year after the crisis, interest in rebounding quickly, according to Andrey Sapunov Chief Investment Consultant, at Finam. “Our individual client base grew 50% last year and in only January of this year it increased by 25%. The volumes of trade during the crisis were under 22 billion roubles, now it’s 60 billion roubles due to individual and institutional investors.” Russia’s Micex has grown by nearly half from its January low, led by Polyus gold, with energy companies increasingly returning to favour. Private investors like Alexander who have seen it before are getting in early – despite the risk. “Now there is a chance to earn money – I saw it 10 years ago. In 4 years some of my friends made over 1000%. That time I was late to enter the market. But I would not lose my chance. But risk still exists so I use only my savings and don't sell anything to get the liquidity for investments.” Enthusiasm isn’t diminished by sentiment that the recent stockmarket gains have only been a bear market rally.  Despite commentators such as George Soros predicting that equities are still likely to head lower, an increasing number of Russian investors are viewing the prospect as a buying opportunity.

"16 Mar, 2009",'US uses Europe as a bridge-head to attack Eurasia',"The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics. RT spoke to Graziani in Rome. RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures. It affects all levels of society. In Italy we are seeing more support towards right wing anti-immigration policies. How can Italy and how can we all outlive the world financial crisis? Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and Japan. This crisis has affected the whole world market. As for Italy, the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010. Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium enterprises, there’s no high concentration of industry, and therefore Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the crisis. Anyway, the crisis will be very deep. We’ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a continental geo-economic context. It means that we should look for recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as Russia, China and India are going to have their part. The crisis cannot be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in Brussels by the European Union only.  RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but still, it was among those taken hostage by it. The truth has been concealed. What is the real origin of the dispute? T.G.: The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as EU expansion into Eastern European countries. These two coinciding enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close neighbourhood. This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall. From that moment the United States had decided to manage the whole planet. They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it’s known that Central Asia has huge resources of gas and oil. The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine. From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its natural location, or from Moscow. If we analyze the so-called ‘Orange Revolution’, we’ll realize that behind these achievements of the so-called civil society of Ukraine were interests coming from across the Atlantic, from Washington. We mustn’t also forget about the influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian republics. When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo-political context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it’s evident that when it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other. Obviously gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine's leaders lack sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests. Instead of looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas designated for European nations. This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press, including the Italian press. In the gas dispute, the majority of Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used geo-policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal economic transactions concerning gas. RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default. Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year. T.G.: I believe it’s possible to find an economic agreement. Moscow and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts. I’d like to stress again that it’s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and import. It’s a geopolitical issue. It’s evident, if Ukraine chooses to set up a Western camp with Washington’s leadership, that’ll affect not only gas, but also other economic issues as well. Hence, I believe, it’ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes from Kiev, because it depends on Washington’s interests. RT: While we’re focusing on Washington let's talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here? T.G.: Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but they aren’t politically conscious. Thus, in the case of the enlargement of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main argument was environmental. And the main motive was hidden as, in reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they’d have the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in Serbia, which also depends on Washington. In future it’ll be possible to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia. The Yugoslavian nation, Serbia in this case, wasn’t chosen by chance, but because it has some cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow. RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia-EU relations, many EU states are already looking for alternative suppliers. Does Russia need to worry? T.G.: No, I don’t think Russia should worry about it. I think every country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning energy supplies and be self-sufficient. In a wider geo-political context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe, between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests: exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources and, obviously, cultural relations. I believe cultural relations between the European Union and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened. After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture. If we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the 1930s we’ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect language with many borrowed English words. It is a result of cultural colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until today. It’s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in the countries of the former Soviet block. RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia-EU relations? T.G.: Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the European Union is a potential partner of I’d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula. Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy. But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well. Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position. Besides, Italy’s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level. And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration. I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London. RT: You’re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world anymore. T.G.: I’m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge-head to attack the whole Eurasian ground. It makes me critical, but, of course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account. And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over. At present, in the 21st century, on a geo-political level we have a multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some states in South America, which are also creating their own geo-political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too. In particular, major liberties which these South-American countries enjoy can allow the European Union to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain. RT: You travel all over Europe’s hotspots and breakaway regions. You were monitoring the election in Transdniester. There is an island off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that’s just declared independence, they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Is there one universal formula on how to deal with separatism? T.G.: These issues are absolutely different. In Sardinia there is a political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now. As for Transdniester, it’s necessary to view its situation from the geo-strategic point of view. The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel the weight of the United States and NATO. Transdniester is one of the so called frozen conflicts. I think Transdniester’s independence would be interesting, because in this case it’ll become an area the United States won’t be able to enter. It’ll be a territory of liberty from the Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its sovereignty. I don’t analyze this republic judging it by its actual government. I only analyze its geo-strategic and geo-political situation. Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its small territory there are no NATO bases.

"17 Dec, 2008",Wednesday’s press review,"This Wednesday Russian newspapers describe yesterday’s diplomatic miracle in New York, look into the U.S.-British disagreement over Afghanistan, quote Lech Walesa on the current Polish government and analyze the Western angle in the politics of Georgia an ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETAwrites that Condoleezza Rice’s smile together with her verbally expressed gratitude to Russia for co-authoring the latest UN Security Council resolution on the Middle East was received as an unprecedented diplomatic miracle after months of tough rhetoric addressed to Moscow which had caused analysts to start talking of a new Cold War. The paper says the resolution became an example of how strong the song becomes if the singing is done together by Russia and the U.S. There could have been many more songs like this one, concludes the paper, if Washington had paid heed to Moscow’s opinion that international politics is not about emotions but common sense and calculation. VREMYA NOVOSTEIsays about the same event that the only cause for surprise about the last-in-the-year UN Security Council resolution on the Middle East, which in other senses was a usual UN document dismissed by its critics as ‘toothless,’ was the fact that it was jointly authored by the U.S. and Russia, and that Condoleezza Rice behaved in an unusual way. The paper says, after her words of gratitude towards Russia ‘we even started feeling slightly sorry that the current Secretary of State is leaving her office in January.’ The document itself, says the paper, is, in fact, quite useful for the peace process in the Middle East: it confirms the unanimous opinion of the four international mediators and is a good stepping stone for further work in this format; it also supports the idea of arranging the next meeting of the two sides of the conflict together with the mediators in 2009 in Moscow.IZVESTIApublishes an exclusive interview with the famous ‘Man of Iron,’ the former president of Poland Lech Walesa who says in response to the question about the recent Polish government-sponsored accusations that he allegedly worked for the People’s Republic of Poland’s security services when he was the leader of the independent trade union ‘Solidarity’: ‘The people who are in power in nowadays Poland are populists and demagogues, they cannot achieve any success in anything they are doing, so instead of strengthening the economy they want to publicly harm someone else.’MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETStakes the reader on a detailed tour of the background of Nino Burdjanadze, one of the current leaders of the Georgian opposition and a possible replacement of Mikhail Saakashvili as president. The paper traces her origins as a daughter of an old Communist Party functionary and personal friend of Eduard Shevardnadze who after the collapse of the Soviet Union evolved into the ‘bread and wheat king of Georgia’ by monopolizing the bread industry during the Georgian war of the early 1990s. The paper quotes a Georgian politician who says: ‘The most dangerous people for Georgia at the moment are not the nationalists but the children of the first secretaries of provincial and city Communist Party members of the Soviet Union who have passed through the hands of George Soros.’Nino Burdjanadze is one of them, says the paper, and she has shown a lot of political shrewdness in the past few years, first learning from Shevardnadze then turning her back on her teacher, then staunchly defending Saakashvili in 2007 only to leave politics for a while and return as his strongest critic after his aggression against South Ossetia. Today, however, says the paper, in spite of Burdjanadze’s tough rhetoric addressed to the current president, the response from the government media is not tough in any way. Maybe, says the paper, Saakashvili who is ‘running around and beating his wings like a beheaded chicken trying to prove that he is still alive,’ in fact is preparing himself and his supporters for a smooth transfer of power to Burdjanadze who has all the markings of the next president of Georgia pre-selected by Washington, awaiting orders to make the final move.KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDAwrites that the next Russia-U.S. chess game in the Caucasus is going to be played out in Azerbaijan. The paper says that Baku, bathing, like Moscow, in oil income, isn’t as heavily involved with the world’s stock markets, so its perspectives for the financial crisis are somewhat brighter. However the country has found itself inside a knot of political and economic interests of three major powers: its neighbours Russia and Iran, and the United States.The paper says the latest shifts in geopolitical meaning of whole regions of the world have made Azerbaijan’s claim to being a European nation quite reasonable. It quotes a well-known author of spy fiction, Chingiz Abdullaev, as saying that his nation’s constant balancing act between the West and the East is a dangerous but necessary policy. He says: ‘We have to act like a choosy bride. Azerbaijan is not only the key to the Caspian but to the whole of Southern Caucasus, and to the East as well – to Iran and Iraq. Who owns Baku, owns the region.’ Evgeny Belenkiy, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"27 Jan, 2008",Is Russia's economy recession-proof?,"As world markets face an economic downturn, delegates at the World Economic Forum have been looking at what the future has in store. Russia, backed by its rich energy resources, is searching for a new role in the global economy along with other emerging m A frequent joke at Davos World Economic Forum this year – it is difficult to find an optimist here. Certainly that was the case at the beginning of the 2008 Davos meeting. All thanks to the financial crisis and growing fears of a recession in the US and elsewhere. Those who gathered here hoped for the best but feared the worst. “What is happening is obviously there has been a psychological impact because of the American crisis,”Frits Seegers, the Chief Executive of Barclays Bank, said. George Soros, world famous investor, went as far as calling it the most serious financial crisis in the last 60 years! While at the previous forums the champions were the heads of the leading Western companies – this time it was businesses from the oil-rich Middle East and emerging powers such as China, India and Russia, who displayed self-assurance and good humour. Concerns about the U.S. economy going in to recession have dominated business this week, and contributed to a volatile few days on the global stock markets. But the US secretary of State Condoleezza Rice tried to reassure everyone that the US economy is strong enough to recover. Business leaders and politicians and the jury's still out believe Russia would be affected if the U.S. goes under. Chairman and CEO of VTB Bank, Andrey Kostin, says the effect on Russia would be minimal. “I don’t think either Russia's industrial or financial sectors will be very much affected – with the exception maybe of the stock price of Russian companies,”Kostin said. Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain says that Russia is insulated from a slowdown in the U.S. “Because of the energy sector and the importance of energy, oil and gas, to the Russian economy. So, I think Russia will do relatively better in terms of economic growth,”he added. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Aleksey Kudrin is more cautious. He says Russia hasn’t realized all the consequences of the current crisis yet. However Russia's Finance minister – who recently paid off its debts to foreign creditors – suggested that the country already has enough financial reserves to help cushion the impact of the world crisis.

"13 Nov, 2007",The Media Mirror – Today's Russian press review,"The twists and turns of Georgian politics and south-east Asia's reliance on Russian trade – both are mentioned extensively. VREMYA NOVOSTEIwrites that the United Opposition of Georgia has announced the name of its presidential candidate. Levan Gachechiladze, one of the leaders of the recent protests, was a predictable option. But the announcement came earlier than planned, says the paper. The opposition promised to name the candidate only after the state of emergency was lifted. The announcement by the Labour Party of its own separate candidate, Shalva Natelashvili, came as a surprise and triggered an early launch of the election campaign. So, there goes the united opposition? Not necessarily, writes the paper and quotes a Georgian political scientist, Georgy Hughesvili: at the last moment before the election all “extra” candidates may abort their campaigns and support a single candidate with the best chance to win. TRUDwrites that envoys from the leading world nations and international organisations have arrived in Tbilisi to ask unpleasant questions about November 7. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Brize delivered a message from Condoleezza Rice, demanding the state of emergency be lifted and the restoration of normal television broadcasting. The U.S., writes the paper, seems to want the government and opposition to share the blame for the recent events. IZVESTIAgives biographical data of every opposition candidate and quotes a Soros Fund executive saying, Saakashvili’s chances are 50:50. The Internet poll taken by the newspaper shows that in Russia 38% believe Saakashvili will stay. 37% think the opposition would win but it will pursue the same policies. 16% say anyone is better than the incumbent. 9% believe relations with Russia would improve, because they cannot be any worse than they are today. VREMYA NOVOSTEIquotes the Russian Ambassador in Bangkok, Evgeny Afanasyev, who says the Kingdom of Thailand is Russia’s number one trade partner in South-east Asia. The envoy says it would be great if the share of military and technical co-operation would become more prominent in the $US 2 BLN trade turnover. The interview was taken during the exhibition Defence and Security 2007 where Russian arms and military equipment drew the usual large amount of attention. The paper says participating in the annual exhibition is one of the steps Russia is taking to enter the Thai and South-east Asian arms market which has been traditionally American for decades.

"8 Nov, 2007",Dollar hits all-time low as China turns to euro,"The U.S. dollar has tumbled to an all-time low against the euro after Chinese officials proposed slashing the dollar component of their reserves. The Chinese Central Bank believes the dollar is losing its status as the world currency, and is now looking at divesting its greenback assets. Dollars currently make up to 70% of China’s $US 1.4 TLN worth of foreign exchange assets. Vladimir Osakovsky, economist at Aton Capital, says China is lagging behind Russia when it comes to reserves and is doing what Russia did a couple of years ago and for the same reason. “China has a much stronger exposure to the dollar,” Mr Osakovsky said. The chief economist at Deutsche Bank, Yaroslav Lissovolik, says Russia should now be switching the 50% of its reserves still in dollars to other currencies. “If the Russian Central Bank doesn’t want to bear capital losses, as was the case with some of the Asian Central Banks, you will see continuing diversification away from the dollar to more appreciating currencies – euro, sterling, possibly some Asian currencies,”he said. The mood on Wall Street remains is grim, with some of the biggest firms from Merrill Lynch to General Motors posting record losses. Billionaire investor George Soros has predicted “a very serious economic correction” for the entire U.S. economy. And with a Fed rate cut shortly expected to sink the greenback further, Russia’s Central Bank is unlikely to sit on its hands for long.

"11 Mar, 2007",One year since Milosevic's death,"It has been one year since the death of Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia. He was tried for war crimes in The Hague, but died of a heart attack while in custody. Milosevic had been in power for eleven years during the 1990s. The period is seen as one of the most violent times in the history of the Balkans. Over eight years the region saw a succession of violent conflicts. Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Kosovo went through spasms of bloodletting, which left tens of thousands killed. Many Serbs now blame Milosevic for both instigating the wars and failing to stop them.In 2000 he was voted out of the office in the election and nine months later was arrested by the Yugoslav authorities. Later he was handed over to the Hague tribunal charged with war crimes and genocide. That's where he died on March 11 2006 some 50 hours prior to the trial's verdict. A heart attack was the official cause, while his supporters say that he was poisoned.Milosevic's role is being strongly debated now in Serbia, with less people supporting him every day. Seven years on without him, Serbia has become a different state. And while the majority is criticizing Milosevic for the problems the country is now facing, like the Kosovo dispute and Serbia's struggle for the EU accession, some continue seeing him as the great leader. His socialist party is still winning seats in the parliament in every election.During Slobodan Milosevic's rule, his brother Borislav was the Yugoslav ambassador to Russia.In an exclusive interview which he gave Russia Today, Borislav Milosevic said the time was right to dismiss the International Criminal Tribunal against the former Yugoslavia.“They [in the Hague] proved nothing. Former Russian Prime minister Evgeny Primakov said the Hague tribunal on former Yugoslavia is insolvent. The tribunal accused Slobodan of genocide. But the UN international court, that was founded in 1946, declined (maybe disproved?) all the accusations of genocide. Back in 2000, the current Russian foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Hague tribunal was politicized from the very beginning. That it tries to blame only one nation for all crimes, the Serbs. That it adapts international law to the wishes of its founders. And it's being financed not only by the UN, but also from private sources, for example, by George Soros. The tribunal accused the Serbian people, the Serbian academy of sciences, and even the Serbian Orthodox church of intending to create ”Greater Serbia“. It's time to dismiss the tribunal. But it survives thanks to the efforts of some countries. Because it works for them, as an instrument,”stressed Borislav Milosevic.
