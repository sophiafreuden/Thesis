secretary high above the chamber of the House of Lords They were the final court of appeal, all of them members of parliament, albeit by appointment rather than election Before Tony Blair set up a separate Supreme Court (who else would be responsible for the distinctly un common law modernisation of a US style Supreme Court ), † the delicate balance between legislature, executive courts and Crown was something to behold A Heath Robinson Affair no doubt But it worked The seismic re writing of an un written constitution by 11 unelected unremovable justices over the prorogation of parliament effectively abolishes the Royal Prerogative exercised by British Prime Ministers for centuries It begins the unravelling of the notion that the PM and the Government represent the Queen in Parliament and on matters in which parliament itself does not preclude them, can exercise executive authority From now on, many, maybe most things, will be ultimately decided not in parliament by elected MPs but in courts by unelected judges Judicial Review just went nuclear This may be a good thing, it may be a bad thing, but it cannot be denied, that no parliament ever agreed to this un elective surgery Thus the constitution of the country has been radically re shaped without a vote being cast Adding insult to injury, the state itself will pay the costs of the case through legal aid The irony is that Boris Johnson s ill fated prorogation of parliament for around an extra week than would be normal at this time of the year and this stage of a parliament served him no purpose whatsoever and this would have been the case even if he had won the case If, as the Court decided, Johnson had set out to stymie (a Scottish Golfing term meaning to frustrate) well he plainly didn t succeed No sooner than he announced it the Benn Burt Bill passed through both Houses of Parliament in record quick time which trussed him up like a turkey, forcing him to abandon his No Deal Brexit negotiating strategy with the EU and to beg them for another three month extension of British membership for starters It is true that the prime minister set out to frustrate the ability of the parliament to stymie him But it is also true that the parliament itself has set out to frustrate the decision of the British people to leave the EU And not for a week but for three long years Although both sides made clear in the Brexit referendum that the people s decision would be final, then jointly triggered Article 50 which set the clock ticking towards exit, then jointly stood for election in 2017 in Theresa May s foolhardily unnecessary election promising to respect the result of the referendum, the narrow outcome of that election put Brexit in trouble from the beginning of this parliament It is a parliament overwhelmingly Remain at heart which gradually recovered its confidence to frustrate the electorate Its confidence was richly boosted by the support of the richest people in the land (indeed the world everyone from George Soros to the American banks have had their tuppence worth ), the deep state, the EU itself, the financial sector (virtually unanimously), international capital (as opposed to the much smaller national bourgeoisie ) and most of the printed media and all of the broadcast media A cacophony of clamour to stop Brexit by hook or by crook has steadily grown and the court case is merely a part of this No one can now predict where this goes The prime minister s efforts to force a new election to change the parliamentary arithmetic seems doomed to fail Thanks to the fixed term parliaments act two thirds of MPs have to vote for an early election The opposition cry simultaneously Tories Out and Tories In by virtue of their refusal to allow an election Ably assisted by the Speaker of the House the rebels are now in charge of the parliament and can, for now, do as they will They may force Johnson or a replacement non partisan prime minster to seek an extension which by the terms of the Benn Burt Bill can be at the pleasure of the EU as to its duration Or they may drunk on success seek to revoke Article 50 altogether and remove the clock thus effectively returning the whole matter to the status quo ante But the people of England have not spoken yet Wales voted for Brexit, Scotland did not But England voted overwhelmingly for Brexit The political class are counting on ennui wearing down the Brexit 17 4 million by the passage of time and literally years of scaremongering Project Fear My own experience in the Midlands and the North (I spend my weekends in one or the other) suggests that this whole series of betrayals has hardened resolve rather than weakened it My own feeling is that the electorate will exact a terrible vengeance on the politicians when the time finally comes to face them And that if they fail even then, Britain and British democracy will never be the same again And I don t mean that in a good way A terrible beauty may be born ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/469574-boris-johnson-supreme-court-brexit/

"5 Jul, 2019",Gangster mayors and oligarch‚Äôs dirty money: Will former criminals hold on to power in Ukraine?,"As Ukraine braces for an early parliamentary vote, its political elites are desperately looking for ways to forge alliances that would be of benefit in the new political environment Some deals, however, look shadier than others While Ukraine s major political parties led by former President Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are preparing to face off, as well as the newly formed party of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a parliamentary election, some political figures with a long criminal history also want a piece of the pie One of the leaders of the newlyformed Opposition Bloc who made it to the top of its election list, Gennady Trukhanov, appears to have a particularly gruesome criminal history behind him Since 2014, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odessa Ukraine s largest port and the third most populous city He is a political veteran who has been building his career in Ukraine s upper echelons of power for about a decade and a half Yet, his fine appearance hides the fact that he was once a member of a notorious gang which was allegedly involved in smuggling arms and drugs According to a 2018 BBCreport, the gang, which came into being in the 1990s, was linked to some particularly gruesome murders Trukhanov, who is involved in martial arts and has been thepresidentof the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation of Muay Thai since 2003, trained members of the gang in hand to hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons, ùthe BBC said, citing data from Italian police A reportcompiledby Italian law enforcement in the late 1990s names Trukhanov as one of the leaders of the gang who had extensive contacts with Ukrainian law enforcement He was also said to enjoy close ties with another gang leader a notorious crime lord called Aleksandr Angert, aka Sasha Angel Angert was sentenced to 15 years in prison for premeditated murder in 1980, but was released 10 years later as he was allegedly suffering from stomach cancer, which, however, apparently did not stop him from taking a leading role in another gang along with Trukhanov Later, Angert, one of Odessa s most influential crime lords, moved to London, where he has lived ever since and allegedly moved from crime to business, dissolving his gangs However, he reportedlyretainedhis close ties with his now business partner Trukhanov The criminal turned mayor, meanwhile, apparently did not wipe the slate clean after moving away from gang activities A 2016reportby the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), citing the Panama Papers, revealed that the mayor owns an entire business empire in Ukraine controlled through offshore firms registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is actively involved in embezzlement and money laundering Another Opposition Bloc leader who found his way to the top of the election list is Gennady Kernes, the longstanding mayor of Kharkov For about two decades, he has ruled over the nation s second most populous city (almost 1 5 million people), also a large industrial and science center He managed to retain his post through a range of political cataclysms, from the 2004 orangerevolution that brought Yushchenko to power, to the 2014 Maidan coup He has, however, a few skeletons in the closet According to an extensivereportpublished by an investigative media project called Criminal Ukraine , the now respectable mayor started his career in the 1990s as a fraudster, whose gang ran several shady schemes Eventually, they decided to expand ùtheir business ùand move from fraud to blackmail and extortion Kernes gang was even suspected of murder at one point, but those charges were apparently not proven Eventually, Kernes (nicknamed Gepa) was arrested, but only sentenced to three years in prison, and was set free two years later due to active repentance ùFollowing his release, the future mayor turned to privatization and managed to obtain quite a number of assets in Kharkov, including factories and real estate, through shady schemes, eventually emerging as a wealthy businessman ù Later, he allegedly used his influence to exert pressure on his political rivals and to gag journalists who dared to mention his criminal past in their reports Kharkov Region is located right next to the tumultuous Eastern Ukrainian regions, parts of which refused to recognize Kiev s authority following the 2014 Maidan coup and declared themselves the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics (DPR and LPR) As Kiev still struggles to regain control over the rebellious Donbass republics, having people like Kernes and Trukhanov at the helm of the regional governments will hardly give it much legitimacy in the eyes of the people there Other Ukrainian media reports suggest that Kernes enjoys close ties to controversial Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who is suspected by some of being the real puppet master behind Zelensky s recent landslide victory in the presidential election KernesvisitedKolomoisky in Israel ahead of the presidential runoff, according to one such report The billionaire dismissed the idea of any hidden agenda ùbehind the trip, telling the media that Kernes went to Israel for medical reasons ùand met him by coincidence Kolomoisky, an oligarch who made a fortune during the privatization frenzy in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, might yet turn out to be the one pulling the strings in the newly formed political bloc A sort of Ukrainian George Soros, Kolomoisky gained a reputation of being a shadowy figure seeking to influence politics Unlike Soros, he does not seem to have any particular ideological preference Instead, he apparently tries to place his millions on the winning horse Over the last decade and a half, he has supported the orangerevolution , former President Viktor Yushchenko, and then Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko He attained particular infamy in the wake of the Maidan coup, when he created his own paramilitary force bysponsoringanti Russia battalions Kolomoisky initially financed the notorious ultranationalist Azov Battalion for months in 2014 He is now reportedly one of the major backers of the Opposition Bloc He does not really hide this fact either In May, headmittedhe was consulting ùthe party created by Trukhanov and Kernes, which he called an All Ukrainian project ùHe also held talks with a leader of another party that eventually joined the bloc We have common issues The commercial and political ones, ùhe told Ukrainian Pravda back then, adding that some unsuccessful projects need a reboot ùThe billionaire specifically mentioned aligning ùforces and creating a broader ùagenda as a recipe for moving forward Kernes then rushed todownplaythe oligarch s influence on his party by saying that he neither financed nor consulted ùthe party, while calling his contacts with Kolomoisky a private matter ù As Zelensky s presidential victory clearly shows that Ukrainians have grown tired of the old political ways, tainted by corrupt elites linked to organized crime, he has apparently embraced the idea of rebranding and renewal at least on the surface Whether the dark past will still loom over the bright future they claim to offer remains to be seen ù

Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda they don t get to continue setting it like the election never happened In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the reduction or lifting of sanctions on Russia by Western powers He may not take any action delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with the IMF and other foreign partners It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review ù multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious de communization ù which banned Soviet symbols in the country Ironically, this push for de communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy The NGOs ùinsist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another red line among their national identity demands Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian? Well, Zelensky will also be in big trouble if he tries to restore them, the civilsociety groups ùsay READ MORE: Reality bites: Ukraine s President Zelensky puts showbiz pals in positions of real power The most vague red line of all comes near the end of the list, when the new president is warned against ignoring dialogue with civilsociety ù a command so vague that almost anything ùZelensky does going forward could be interpreted as ignoring their wishes, France 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg wrote on Twitter BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher tweeted that the groups themselves may have crossed a red line †the red line of what civilsociety groups can legitimately demand of a freshly elected government I feel like almost anything he does could be interpreted as crossing one or other of those lines, they re so wide ranging It reads like a manifesto there s an election in 2 months Make a party see if anyone agrees with you that s democracy Zelensky was elected to office with 73 percent of the vote and let s not forget, he won that election having campaigned against many of the policies these civilsociety groups are aggressively demanding be kept in place He has been in office only a matter of days, and these Western backed groups are threatening to instigate political unrest should he take any action that they don t find acceptable to their political agenda So who, exactly, poses the real threat to democracy?

"22 May, 2019",Is Soros-linked Avaaz group a credible source on fake news? Mainstream media seems to think so,"Mainstream news outlets have eagerly reported on a study by the Avaaz campaign group, claiming far right disinformation groups have been spreading fake news in the lead up to EU elections î but is the group all that it seems? The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing people powered politics to decision making everywhere ùand it s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far right and anti EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right wing and anti establishment groups and parties î and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial Be like Captain Von Trapp reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23 26!pic twitter com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls î but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon org (which has been partly funded by left wing Hungarian American billionaire George Soros) î and its co founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context? Independent journalists have had suspicions about Avaaz s own activity for years, noting its strong pro establishment and globalist leanings, which have even translated into outward support for US regime change wars around the world When the group is notpushingfor no fly zones in LibyaandSyria, oragitatingfor regime change in Venezuela and Iran, it is actively supporting centrist, neoliberal political figures across the EU and US Patel told the EUobserver last year that the majority ùof people across Europe stand with ùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and has also activelysupportedFrench President Emmanuel Macron with online videos and petitions While Avaaz is seemingly very concerned with the plight of citizens in places like Venezuela and Iran (it was also activelyinvolvedin promoting Iran s Green Revolution in 2009), it appears to be less concerned with the lives of ordinary Europeans The group has targeted the anti Macron Yellow Vest movement in France and †framed the protesters easy targets for spreading fake news ù î and to put the icing on the cake, blamed the swift spread of this alleged fake news on Russia, another of Avaaz s favorite targets Indeed, unsurprisingly, media reporting on so called election meddling ahead of EU elections has taken on an anti Russia hue, with many suggesting that disinformation groups are simply copying Russian tactics from the 2016 US election, when the Democratic Party claimed Russian disinformation campaigns were a major factor in Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump î a claim for which there remains exactly zero evidence One of these reports on the alleged copycat tactics quotes Ben Nimmo, a former NATO press officer, cited with regularity by mainstream journalists as though he is an impartial source Like clockwork, Nimmo popped up ahead of the EU elections to claim that domestic actors ùacross Europe are now simply doing what the Russians had already been doing ù î because it s easier to blame Russia for social discord in Europe than failed leadership and unpopular policies Once again, it appears that many of the groups claiming to help people recognize fake news online are some of the biggest and sneakiest purveyors of disinformation themselves î and they are frequently promoted by mainstream news outlets î if they are selling the correct narrative, that is Mainstream media continue to quote the founders of cybersecurity firm New Knowledge as credible experts on Russian disinformation tactics, even after the firm wasexposedby the New York Times for having run its own disinformation campaign during a 2017 Alabama senate race The New Knowledge crowd set up fake Russian social media accounts to support one candidate and then worked to publicly brand him as Moscow s pick By not even mentioning Avaaz s own sketchy links, and very clear political leanings, Western news reports citing its studies as completely credible and independent are simply engaging in their own kind of disinformation ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/460010-avaaz-eu-elections-disinformation/

The answer is probably somewhat Unlike its uber liberal neighbor Sweden, Denmark has reacted to the influx of refugees and migrants with increasing hostility The coalition government made up of the center right Venstre and further right Danish People s Party has passed laws requiring refugees to hand over jewelry and valuables to finance their stay, banned the burqa in public, and planned to ship rejected asylum seekers to an uninhabited island in the Baltic sea If you are unwanted in Danish society, you should not be a nuisance to ordinary Danes, ù Immigration Minister Inger St√∏jberg stated when announcing the island plan They are undesirable in Denmark and they must feel it! ù St√∏jberg has been a key author of her government s anti immigration policies In March 2018, she marked the passing of her 50th anti immigration measure by celebrating with a cake decorated with fruit, the Danish flag, and the number 50 #DanishMinister for#Integration(!)

"8 May, 2019",Trump Strangelove: Or how America learned to worry and hate Empire,"President Donald Trump seems to be making Americans hate the empire again, by embracing war or maybe only pretending to do so against Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea and who knows where else One thing to keep in mind about Trump is that his critics tend to instinctively oppose anything he is for, regardless of what they may have thought in the past Take this video, for example, comparing the eerily similar rhetoric behind George W Bush s push for war against Iraq and the Trump administration s current drumbeat for war with Iran, featuring Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Trump is pushing us toward the brink of war with Iran î and it all sounds alarmingly familiar pic twitter com/iLv7Rd8bXL The twist? It was produced by MoveOn org, a Democrat activist group set up in 1998 to oppose the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and bankrolled by George Soros These are the same Democrats, mind, who did nothing to oppose Clinton s 1999 war on Yugoslavia, Obama s 2011 intervention in Libya, or the actual Iraq War for that matter But now they warn against war with Iran because Orange Man Bad! Recall, however, that Trump himself has repeatedly denounced the Iraq War and indeed, used that to bludgeon Jeb Bush during the 2015 Republican primaries, obliterating the candidate the establishment and media thought would be the front runner Then, in 2016, Trump delivered a blisteringforeign policy speechdenouncing nation building and wars of conquest around the globe in favor of America first ù Oh, the establishment in Washington wailed and gnashed their teeth, but took comfort in the knowledge that Trump could never, ever possibly be elected Every single media outlet told them so, after all And then it happened anyway Netanyahu and Trump are gearing up for Bolton s mustache with Iran, and we re all screwed pic twitter com/PIpbvm5828 When the unthinkable happened later that year, the establishment launched every possible effort to resist ùand sabotage Trump s agenda, primarily by the means of the Russiagate conspiracy theory The very Swamp ùin Washington that Trump vowed to drain went to war against anyone who might actually do it from General Michael Flynn onward while steering clear of neocon cadres like Pompeo, Bolton,Kurt VolkerorElliott Abramsthat ended up working for Trump Have you seen any of them accosted at a restaurant, or accused of a scandal in the Washington Post? Of course not This is one possible explanation for why Trump ended up embracing the neocons: they are the only ones actually willing to work in his administration Another possibility, however, is that Trump is aware the very best way to make the establishment hate a position is for him to embrace it Justin Raimondo of Antiwar com, who has watched US foreign policy closely for the past 25 years, is convinced that Trump has embraced the neocons in order toset them upfor a defeat, letting Pompeo and Bolton along with others freely indulge their fantasies of regime change in Caracas or a counter revolution in Tehran, as a way to prove his point that the American Empire he condemned in 2016 is untenable We can see the knife go in as this whole scenario plays out, ùRaimondowrote in February, as Trump embraced regime change in Venezuela Perhaps that sounds a bit too Game of Thrones , but look at what has actually happened since: each attempt by US backed interim president Juan Guaido to take power has failed more spectacularly than the previous one Also note that one of the loudest voices for regime change in Venezuela and a harder line on Cuba, Senator Marco Rubio (R Florida) repaid Trump by voting against his declaration of emergency on the US Mexico border, invoked to overcome Democrat opposition to the border wall I do question Bolton and his motives, and I do NOT want any more wars I struggle with the fact that Trump has Bolton, a well known NeoCon, in this position https: // tdotco /d3g0dIcSOB Recall how the very same media outlets that hounded Trump with the now debunked Russiagate conspiracysang praisesto the beauty of our weapons ùwhen the president fired off some missiles into Syria, to ensure he stays the Assad must go ùcourse While the State Department rhetoric on that has not changed, Trump did order US troops out of Syria and that actually happened,more or less, suggesting that Washington has tacitly given up on regime change in Damascus Of course, this could all be Q level speculation about 4 D chess ùIt is entirely possible that Trump has simply been seduced by the neocon siren call of perpetual war and the American Empire, despite consistently expressed beliefs to the contrary over a long period of time If there is one thing that s been absolutely certain about the Trump presidency so far, it s that the only way to know for sure is to see what happens Nebojsa Malic, for RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/458688-trump-neocons-iran-venezuela/

The exchange came after Fedchenko had shared a video which purported to show Zelensky s campaign team promoting an interview in which controversial Russian MP Natalia Poklonskaya praised the now president elect Poklonskaya is a toxic figure in Ukraine, given that she s a former Ukrainian citizen who, very openly, defected to Russia when Moscow reabsorbed Crimea in 2014 The clip was doctored and the Zelensky logo was afabrication Those of us who watch Ukraine closely know that US officials, think tankers and activists care not a jot for the country, instead viewing it as a handy geopolitical tool to contain and agitate Russia However, they usually manage to massage that truth with well meaning rhetoric about values and the like But, occasionally, the mask slips And this is a good example The fact that the American embassy chose to publicly amplify Fedchenko as an expert on the principles of good journalism speaks volumes And, frankly, very few people, even erstwhile cheerleaders of the 2013/14 Maidan, are buying the baloney anymore ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/458483-us-embassy-kiev-stopfake-propaganda/

"9 Apr, 2019","Netanyahu has snake-charmed Israel for a decade, but have voters had enough of ‚ÄòKing Bibi‚Äô?","If he wins Tuesday s election, Benjamin Netanyahu is set to become Israel s longest serving prime minister But as his tricks have grown hoarier and his persona more outsize than Trump himself, he risks becoming a self caricature Final polls on Friday showed that his right wing coalition was favored to reach the magic number of the 61 seats that would give them a majority in the Knesset, even if the prime minister s own Likud party was not likely to be the biggest individual faction Nonetheless, Netanyahu has, predictably, been in his customary scuttling underdog mode On Monday, he called an emergency ùcabinet meeting to declare that victory in the parliamentary election was not assured So far no bombshells, like the homemade quality video released on election day four years ago, in which he looked his voters † in the eye, and warned them that left wing opponents were bussing in Arabs ù to vote for them and that there was still time The ace up his sleeve was the announcement that he was considering annexing the Jewish settled parts of the West Bank an idea that was long considered beyond the pale, and a sure death knell for the comatose peace process The vague wording left it unclear if he is serious or just pandering to the Zionist parties that he will need for his majority But, by and large, the bitter and vigorous campaign has not been fought on Palestinian issues, or on policy at all, but rather on which man Israel trusts to lead it through an always volatile future In stating his case, Netanyahu, whose election trail skills are perhaps his strongest suit, has been as ubiquitous and domineering as ever In fact, knowing his biblical self belief, after two stints at the top, totaling 13 years, the 69 year old would argue that he is more qualified now than at any time before And perhaps this is the twin problem Bibi is both the status quo, but also Bibi is more Bibi than ever Israel has reached Peak Bibi So all engulfing has his personality been that his opposite number, Benny Gantz, spent time at rallies playing up his similarities to Netanyahu, thanking him for his historic role, before adding a little sheepishly that enough is enough ùGantz, a former IDF chief of staff (one of three on the opposition ticket) was picked both to match up with the incumbent Mr Security note all of Netanyahu s nicknames but also to provide a wholesome contrast to the sleaze that has attached to the man in power and to his celebrity family 59 year old Gantz, a relative newcomer on the political scene says he is not defined by the prime minister, but can you imagine Netanyahu half joking Hey, my name is also Bibi ùto lure his potential voters? This has resulted in a campaign that lacks fire and congruence Gantz has released a video boasting about bombing Gaza back into the Stone Age ùin his previous role, but also says that he is the last chance for peace in the region All this might yet be enough Before understanding why Netanyahu can be toppled, it is important to see why he achieved such iconic status in his homeland in the first place something that his detractors abroad frequently fail to engage with Although he was being blamed for inflaming tensions as far back as the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a far right Zionist in 1995, his time came later As the Oslo Accords failed (despite all the international goodwill invested), as the Second Intifada from 2000 brought suicide bombers to Israeli cities and as the return of Gaza in 2005 resulted in the rise of Hamas, many Israelis, rightly or wrongly, lost any hope that a permanent peace can ever be concluded with the Palestinians Netanyahu perfectly embodies this mood of new unashamed realism Despite what appeared to be an intractable geopolitical predicament, Israel s economy has also grown prodigiously under him Netanyahu also possesses an instinctive grasp of the existential concerns of Israelis When he talks about the threat posed to the very essence of the Jewish State by a rising Arab population, or singularly blames PLO, Hamas or Hezbollah for every conflict that involves Israel, he represents the unvarnishedopinionsof the majority Netanyahu is a true populist not the West s marginalized provocateur figure but in the classical sense, a solidly supported politician who articulates the natural desires of his (exclusively Jewish) people for security, wealth and a proud identity Although not his most frequent comparison, he is perhaps most similar to Hungary s Viktor Orban, a man with whom he incidentally enjoys a particularly close relationship (and both of them loathe George Soros) But Netanyahu is not without flaws and this is where the Trump parallels work best The Israeli politician knew how to grab every headline years before Twitter was even a word, while simultaneously positioning himself as the nemesis of the mainstream media, whom he has repeatedly likened to North Korea Similarly, scandals dogged Netanyahu from the nineties from admitting a love affair to accepting illegal gifts to abusing his power so as to receive positive media coverage His son Yair has also repeatedly made the news for being more strident than his own father despite boasting but a fraction of his dad s achievements and for being mired in his own unseemly prostitution and nepotism episodes; his third wife Sara is unloved All this was compartmentalized and accepted by his supporters as part of the package But, whether emboldened by his track record, the emergence of other politicians in his mold on the world scene, or literally being egged on by Donald Trump s steadfast support of Israel in stark contrast to Barack Obama Netanyahu has somehow grown wilder and more combative His choice phrases in recent TV appearances have been fake news ùand witch hunt ùMuch of his campaign was based on speculating about the consequences of Gantz repeatedly called a weak leftist ù being a security risk because his phone had been hacked by Iran Another line of attack implied that Bibi s opponent was mentally unstable, with one video showing Gantz popping out of a cuckoo clock Israel s big cities are plastered with Stalinesque posters of Netanyahu, often posing with other world leaders, particularly the US president himself While becoming a world figure who crosses political divides is to be celebrated the Israeli PM is an almost monthly guest in Moscow the entire thing reeks of that familiar mix of ego and the need for validation, as well as an emerging personality cult While Donald Trump behaves like he does because he cannot be any other way, it is important to remember that Netanyahu was educated at Harvard and MIT, where he graduated top of his class, having by that point already been an elite unit commando Why a man with such a first class mind and military record needs to play the low rent rabble rouser is less obvious it might be effective, but it is not particularly dignified, stakes always have to be raised to keep passions stirred Even for Trump fans, four years of The Donald is refreshing, eight years could be transformative, but imagine thirteen years of being in thrall to such a big personality, and electing him for another four The baggage weighs heavier, the scion s man of the people act more wearying Many perhaps most Israelis really have had their fill of the one man show So, all in all, rather than morphing into a father of the nation senior statesman, a David Ben Gurion or at least a Shimon Peres, Netanyahu stands on the verge of his eighth decade a more divisive figure than ever Though, of course, if King Bibi is still on his throne on his anniversary, he will tell you that he was right, and you were wrong to doubt him Igor Ogorodnev ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/455941-netanyahu-election-trump-gantz-israel/

We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps: //soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation ss: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news So, the bloc of the centre right parties in the European Parliament, the European People s Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? ps: Look, because Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the European Union as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that s why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs And our position is a very strong anti migration position, which is not shared by many And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements So that s why this is the core of the conflict ss: That s where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you re saying it s much larger of a spectrum, not just centre right, because we get an impression that it s a center right bloc Ok, so that makes sense ps: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament And if you, let s say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you And we have to be honest, European People s Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be ss: So, this suspension happened, took place The head of your Prime Minister s office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP What s going on right now? ps: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People s Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let s put it this way And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP ss: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn t take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote ps: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself ss: So that means, that if it wasn t voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? ps: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow ss: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend ps: Yeah We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing ss: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? ps: No no no We shouldn t confuse the party issue with, let s say, institutional questions The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the European Union, like a cash machine, you know, and don t take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair ss: So you re saying the payouts are not under threat? ps: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well So it s a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long lasting debate or legal procedure ss: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti migrant policy that your country s leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we ve all seen Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? ps: No, no definitely not Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that s going to be the case in the future as well And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don t want that to happen So it s a debate with him, an open debate He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him And my question is, why shouldn t a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary ss: Okay, so let s see how the forces could be re arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro EU, and now it s kind of siding with Italy against Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? ps: Look, I don t think it s fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the European Union ss: Integration, let s put it this way ps: Yeah, yeah, right There s a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward And there are definitely at least two different camps One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels We think it s a dead end street We think this is a bad concept We think that this will not strengthen European Union What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro European position, as we think that the way towards a strong European Union leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong So the debate is rather about that, and that s why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong European Union, but we think that ss: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it s not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you re all part of European Union, you want to be part of European Union, but, like you said, there s definitely two camps One is super pro integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro stronger state and a formal Brussels, let s put it this way So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you ve suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? ps: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we ll see how we go forward But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro migration body And this is something that we don t like ss: So you re leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU s border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation This is a serious accusation ps: These are facts, basically ss: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? ps: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border Let s look at the Internet, at what they have said You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it s not a border protection unit They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together But protecting the entire border to the South of the European Union with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn t know what he or she speaks about We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended ss: Ok, so I m going to play a little bit of devil s advocate, and I m going to tell you what the opposite side is saying The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they re saying it s ludicrous, and it s a conspiracy theory, and they re actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you re not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it s under threat? I just want to hear that ps: Whether the borders are under threat? ss: Do you feel like you re not in control of your own border? ps: We are in control That s why we have built the fence That s why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis A number of them So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border But, you know, it s really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together We think it s a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states ss: So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered ps: Absolutely ss: That s your country as well ps: But this cannot be our country It s physically excluded ss: OK But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary ps: But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary either Greece or Greece and Croatia Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, was that we registered them, and the Greek didn t But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one ss: Another thing Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? ps: Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament Then we don t know the composition of that We don t know the composition of the European Commission So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the European Union, what we see is a huge set of double standards Why? Take the example of Poland The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made They completed all of them from A to Z And what European Commission has done was saying Äúoh, it s not enough, we continue the procedure Äù instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations ss: So I want to talk a little about Hungary s stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that s something that your country speaks very strongly about For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the European Union If that happens, if the pro immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? ps: No, absolutely not That s not in question ss: So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe s population was Muslim And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far fetched, no? He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different ps: Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti anything So we are not anti Muslim We are not anti anything We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent You know, it s unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn t be the case Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo Christian heritage, with its Christian culture And in this regard, I think it s very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate ss: I know you don t like Frontex, but I m still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? ps: You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the European Union, mostly in the Southern and Southern Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe I was in Jordan recently The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom Lebanon the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there The last time the Turkish President has complained about the European Union not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU Turkey deal on migration As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats they ll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing I mean, on the level of European Union, we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the European Union is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe ss: Okay, I get your point Now to a different topic the Russian led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans What s the calculus behind it? What s the logic? ps: Look, now the situation started to change So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute IIB s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension So new and modern investments are happening in the country We are looking for financial background So IIB s involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us ss: But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank It s a normal, usual practice with this international institutions But the Western commentators are saying that actually it s a great base for Russia s intelligence services to operate from What do you say to that? ps: You know, I think I surprised these commentators, including the Hungarian opposition, when I ask them whether they know that five out of the nine owners of this bank are NATO member states Period ss: Thank you very much It s been great pleasure talking to you Good luck with everything ps: Thank you for the invitation again Good being here",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/454459-hungarian-fm-peter-szijjarto/

It seems that without some sort of security net in place, the majority of these people would not have risked such ahazardousjourney Moreover, there are huge budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored (yet are), for as any economist knows, money does not grow on trees This is Sweden Around 15 cars were set on fire in the city of G√§vle tonight 5 women sexually assaulted in Uppsala this weekend Also, there was 4 bombings in 24 hours This is not the Sweden I used to knowüò≠pic twitter com/f1Oqfr0YYT George Soros, the head of Open Society Foundations, believes he has that problem figured out To finance it, heexplainedcasually, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later Really? Well, judging by the Yellow Vest protests occurring on a weekly basis in the French capital, initially sparked by the imposition of a new fuel tax, we have some good indication as to how enthusiastic Europeans will be for such a plan In short, not very The questions don t end there How is it possible that George Soros has been able to sell his unproven and very expensive plan for open borders to the European people? We can take some guidance from the pithy expression Money talks In that case, nobody has done more talking in Europe than Soros Over the years, the billionaire has assembled some 226 reliableallies in the European Parliament to promote his vision of a brave new Europe This cozy arrangement allowed his Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of Open Society Foundations, tomeetwith members of the European Commission on 65 separate occasions last year alone It s probably safe to say that those closed door meetings had no small impact on the political landscape of Europe Enter Viktor Orban, the bane of Brussels, who is playing a role in European history that cannot be overestimated The leader of fiercely independent Hungary has taken a zero tolerance approach to illegal immigration,refusingto permit a single illegal immigrant to enter his country Meanwhile, other eastern European countries Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which, together with Hungary, form the anti immigration Visegrad Group have takensimilarsteps At the same time, across Europe right wing parties aresurgingin popularity In direct defiance of Brussels, Orban has ordered the construction of a barbed wire fence that runs along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia, a project that the mainstream media somehowconflateswith authoritarianism, as if the concept of national borders never existed before in history OrbansentBrussels a bill for half the cost of the fence, but it was never paid, of course That s too bad, because it could have been the smartest money the EU ever spent, since it would have spared Europeans the influx of mass illegal immigration The Hungarian leader has other ideas that Brussels will probably not be considering any time soon, like ways of addressing Europe s dire demographic problem This month, Orban announced a raft of new tax and loan incentives for families as part of government efforts to boost the birth rate without depending on immigration flows to accomplish that goal There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration, hesaidin his annual state of the nation speech We need Hungarian children The plan has some merit Mothers will be eligible for a 10 million forint ($36,000) subsidized loan, he explained One third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born, and the entire loan waived after a third child is born Now compare Orban s plan with that of the Hungarian born George Soros, who somehow believes that maintaining strong national borders will fragment the union Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union, he wrote in Foreign Policy [T]hey also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards Building on that crooked foundation, SorosadvisedEuropean lawmakers back in 2016 that the EU should spend 30 billion ($34 billion) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year We already know who will be forced to pick up the tab on that massive expenditure, and it s not George Soros One reason that Soros and his 226 reliable allies support the influx of migrants into Europe is they believe it will somehow offset the continent s demographic and labor shortage The latter part of that plan has already been proven a disaster An OECD reportfoundthat less than 40 percent of immigrants had completed an upper secondary school education or higher, while another studyshowedthat only eight percent of asylum seekers were hired by companies as skilled workers Despite clear signs that George Soros grand plans for the European Union are an utter failure, Brussels continues to heed his every word, while at the same time taking steps topunishOrban Just this week, Soroswarned, with no loss of irony, that if Europe doesn t wake up it will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991 The financier fretted over the rise of far right parties in Europe, which he believes will enjoy a competitive advantage in parliamentary elections in May Yes, that is a very big possibility Not once did he suggest, however, that just maybe his grand idea of open borders, made all the more tempting with cash enticements, might just have contributed to that radical disequilibrium of which he spoke If Europe is one day visited by the ghost of its fascist past, George Soros will only have himself to blame Influential people like Soros would have made a far greater impact had they advocated on behalf of peace in the Middle East and North Africa, speaking out on US led interventionist wars that have prompted millions of innocent people to flee their homes Innocent people from war torn countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria deserve the same rights to peace and happiness without having to travel thousands of miles away from home to find it which ironically leads them directly into the homelands of the people who invaded them in the first place! In conclusion, it is highly disturbing that Brussels is willing to give so much credence to a billionaire financier with questionable motives for opening Europe s floodgates to illegal immigration, while vilifying a democratically elected European head of state for attempting to exert some kind of order on a situation that is clearly way out of control",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/451479-europe-george-soros-orban/

"4 Feb, 2019","Happy Birthday, Facebook! A short history of the social network‚Äôs biggest gaffes","Facebook turns 15 today and to reflect on how the world has changed since Mark Zuckerberg first dreamt up what would become a scandal plagued global behemoth, RT looks back at some of its biggest controversies Zuckerberg s questionable †moves first came to light back in 2004 when he brutally cut his co founder Eduardo Saverin out of the picture in a shady move that saw him set up a new company in order to absorb the original, drastically diluting Saverin s shares The sneaky move was made just months after the social network launched and Zuckerberg soon faced lawsuits from Saverin and fellow Harvard students Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who claimed Zuckerberg stole their concept for the platform Zuckerberg settled and gave the brothers $20 million, plus Facebook shares The Winklevoss used a fraction of that payout to invest in Bitcoin and are now billionaires Facebook launched Beacon in 2007 as an advertising system which sent data from partner websites back to Facebook for targeted advertising These websites were able to publish information about Facebook users activities on their news feeds, leading to some sticky situations for users, such as people who were having affairs being exposed A class action suit followed and Beacon was eventually shut down in 2009 In October 2010, the Wall Street Journal revealed that 10 of Facebook s most popular apps like FarmVille had access to users identity numbers that allowed them to track them and their online habits, no matter what privacy settings the users had set The apps were also able to track app users friends, and some of these app companies then spread Facebook user data to other companies Zuckerberg frames his empire as a force for good in the world, and Facebook s Free Basics project offering free internet to people around the world was touted as a noble way to get the globe online when it was launched as Internet org in 2013 However, it wasn t long before it emerged that the free internet project was extremely limited as in, just to Facebook and a selection of the internet determined by the social network The company was accused of digital colonialism and sparked outrage in the countries it said it was helping The early push for the project wasn t helped by the fact that one of its key satellites blew up in a SpaceX shuttle launch disaster in 2016 Facebook recently rolled out its Express Wi Fi initiative in Ghana, and has quietly expanded Free Basics to Laos and Morocco In 2012 Facebook thought it would be a cool idea to carry out an experiment to see how it could affect its users emotions by manipulating their news feeds Nearly 700,000 users were unsuspecting guinea pigs and their timelines were changed to increase positive or negative content without their knowledge or explicit consent The results were published in a report entitled Experimental evidence of massive scale emotional contagion through social networks and was slammed by researchers and academics who said consent is a key part of such research and Facebook was breaching research ethics Facebook s Trending Topics news section was exposed as being biased in 2016 after former employees revealed how the company curated the feed with topics that weren t in fact trending, and alleged conservative media outlets were deliberately suppressed This contradicted Facebook s earlier claims that the curation was done by algorithms and showed human intervention and therefore editorial decisions at almost every stage ù of the process The section was shuttered in 2018, and Facebook introduced fake news fighting partnership with the Atlantic Council and media outlets to rank news items by their trustworthiness Facebook Live gave the company serious headaches when people started broadcasting themselves engaged in controversial acts after it was rolled out in early 2016 Murders, suicides, and acts of torture were shared on the site, drawing widespread condemnation and alarm The broadcasts included a 74 year old named Robert Godwin Sr being fatally shot at point blank range, and a man in Thailand who hung his 11 month old before killing himself in a gruesome live stream Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal was one of its biggest and arguably still rocks the company It emerged in 2018 that the political consulting firm possessed data on 87 million Facebook users, which was gathered through an app posing as a personality quiz The app then harvested participants data, along with information on their Facebook friends and this was shared with Cambridge Analytica, who in turn used the data to target political ads during elections in the US and elsewhere In March 2018 the United Nations highlighted Facebook s role in the slaughter of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar The social network is accused of allowing fake news to spread about the Rohingya, which contributed to the violence A New York Timesreporton Facebook s internal affairs revealed the mess taking place behind the scenes as Facebook weathered an array of recent scandals Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg didn t come off well in the report, with both accused of handing off responsibility to subordinates in times of crisis and ignoring massive warning signs in favor of pursuing growth The biggest doozy was the revelation that Facebook employees

a tome which insists Stalin had been secretly plotting an offensive against Hitler s Germany but first he wanted Hitler to destroy democracy in Europe, in the manner of an icebreaker, thereby clearing the way for world communism In other words, not the version you learned at school Except, surprise, surprise, this statement on Suvorov s book isn t true As †one scholarpointed out, while demanding a correction from Harding, it s more accurate to say the opposite is the case Indeed, †the scholarreferenced, Suvorov s argument was rapidly countered by much of the established Russian historical community, including Dmitry Volkogonov, with the support of Western historians We ve been here before with Harding He s repeatedly weaved fantastical stories about Russia, and other subjects, for years But, as the legendary ex Moscow hack Mark Amesobserves literally nothing Harding publishes, no matter how demonstrably false and reckless, will ever hurt his journalism career He s a Made Man Guardian hack Luke Harding was caught plagiarizing me,@yashalevine& others îand it had zero effect on his career advancement If his latest scoop ù on Manafort/Assange is debunked, there will be zero consequences Most of us still can t fully grasp thishttps: // tdotco /8AeD8GRXh0 And, while he s an especially blatant example, Harding is not alone in this Because on the Russia beat, it seems Western journalists can pretty much get away with any transgressions, without suffering career damage Instead, paradoxically, it often seems to even lead to professional progression Today, you hear a lot of hysteria concerning Russian disinformation in the West, but little or nothing, in mainstream media, on disinformation about Russia, something this writer has tried to cover in recent years And it s a lonely beat Indeed, as the Canadian academic Paul Robinson rightly notes, while there s a huge army of well funded institutions and individuals now devoted to uncovering and countering Russian disinformation, there seems to be little or no accountability for the false stories produced by Western sources (on Russia) And the examples are legion With even the most heinous fakes failing to amount to any sort of setback for their promoters Which suggests editors are more than happy to indulge the practice, because after all it s only Russia and everyone knows Russia is bad Here are a few selected lowlights Numerous other examples exist but more are hardly needed to show how there seems to be no penalty for getting Russia wrong in Western media And, on the contrary, it s hardly a conspiracy theory to suggest it s actively encouraged Which means, of course, disinformation about Russia is far more common, organized and influential than notional Russian disinformation Particularly on social networks, but prevalent too in supposedly respectable media READ MORE: The only Russian bots to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat linked experts Nevertheless, don t hold your breath waiting for the usual think tank info war chancers to issue reports, dripping with condemnation Because this isn t about delivering truth in the news, it s about keeping control of the narrative ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/448320-western-media-rewards-fake-news/

As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his Open Society Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East?

If you guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the European Union, is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

the contradictions of an empire run on the basis of slavery, tribute, and plunder were so great it was inevitable they would become insurmountable Under Rome s rule, millions lived in poverty and squalor, supporting an elite whose wealth and ostentation was so obscene it became increasingly untenable By now, hopefully, a measure of drift is being got Any economic system that operates on the basis of coercion, domination, and hyper exploitation gives rise to resistance This in turn leads to more force being deployed to maintain it, which only succeeds in catalyzing more resistance and, with it, destabilization It is this destabilization that produces the mass movement of people and peoples This, in sum, is what ended Rome, doing so in a dynamic the early stages of which are evident in our time with a growing migration crisis slowly and incrementally chipping away at the foundations of Western hegemony The 2015 refugee crisis that beset Europe, and which remains unresolved, is a case in point, as is the aforementioned migrant caravan, currently wending its way to the US border through Mexico from Central America Here we are obliged to take a quick detour and address the tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theory brigade whose increasing number reflects not growing awareness but rising lunacy The notion that the migrant caravan is a Soros funded stunt and/or Democratic Party ruse in the run up to the US midterm elections is nothing if not preposterous The suffering endured over generations by the peoples of Central America due to the militarism and economic domination of the US has and continues to be inordinate Therefore denying its victims agency is tantamount to denying them dignity Honduras, from where the migrant caravan originates, was the scene of a coup in 2009, which succeeded in toppling the democratically elected leftist government of Manuel Zelaya The coup was led by General Romeo VasquezVelasquez, graduate of the notoriousSchool of the Americas(renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation in 2001) at Fort Benning, Georgia Thousands of military and security personnel from Central and Latin America have been trained in torture, assassination, and repression there since WWII Accordingto US foreign policy specialist Professor Stephen Zunes, the Honduran coup, which took place under Obama s watch with Hillary Clinton in post as secretary of state, ushered in a period of horrific repression and [a] skyrocketing murder rate [resulting in] tens of thousands of refugees fleeing for safety ù Though Zunes is careful not to allege Washington s direct involvement in the coup, the conspicuous refusal to call for the restoration of the country s legitimate president in the aftermath tells us everything we need to know with regard to an agenda that has for centuries viewed the various nations of this benighted region as a wholly owned subsidiary So now we have a migrant caravan making its way north and in Washington, President Donald Trump, describing it as aninvasionwhile deploying 5,000 troops to the border Though every occupant of the White House since time immemorial has made a virtue of injustice, in Trump, the Roman philosopher Seneca s words spring singularly to life: For greed all nature is too little ù The greed for wealth, power, status, and fame that drives and determines Trump s every wheeze is symptomatic of the sick society and cultural values of which he is product It is those values responsible for the migrant caravan, and it is those values that will produce in time the downfall of the empire that occupies the space in our world that Rome occupied in its What cannot be denied, no matter the industrial scale national propaganda produced to the contrary, is that the masses of the poor and oppressed in the US have far more in common with the people on this migrant caravan than they could ever possibly have with their own ruling class Ensuring that they never latch onto this fact is all that lies between their continued parlous condition and liberation not to mention that of the continent and world entire ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442864-american-empire-migrant-caravan/

At this point, I would like to say that, as an American, it is difficult to fathom how the question of a strong border has become such a political football The United States has a very fair system for allowing people to become naturalized citizens, and asylum seekers are accorded all the protections mandated by the law The only requirement is that migrants follow the legal procedures for entry, and if that sounds like a radical or xenophobic idea, as many Liberals today seem to believe, then the majority of countries in the world would have to be classified as racist Somehow the US went from being an ethnically diverse country comprised of law abiding immigrants, to a nation that thinks it s alright to accept law breaking border jumpers as future citizens In times past, before the age of virtue signaling, social justice warriors and PC dementia was all the rage, a group of undocumented people storming the US border would have been dealt with in the appropriate manner, and without any questions asked Today, however, many Western governments have been infected by the globalist creed, Merkel style, that says it is the duty of Western democracies to let oppressed migrants into their countries en masse and unmolested Meanwhile, it is the migrants who areportrayedas heroes in the Western media, while the people who want to defend their borders are some sort of knuckle dragging xenophobes In the case of the European Union, countries that fight back against the concept of loose borders, like Hungary, for example, are treated like pariah states, even suffering severe disciplinary action The situation is so grave and arouses so many different emotions that the issue of borders actually has the power to break up the West into two camps the nationalists on one side and the globalists on the other When one looks a bit deeper at the situation, the Liberal desire to accept migrants with open arms is dripping with hypocrisy and not a little blood After all, if the Democrats (and Republicans) really wanted to address the problem of mass migration at the root they would be out on the streets demanding that their governments cease and desist from waging war on sovereign states That is the real reason why so many people are fleeing their homes for a new life military aggression It s a national embarrassment that a group of illegal immigrants can cross our border and receive free healthcare/benefits, while veterans that have served this country are put on a waiting list Even tiny Honduras is no stranger to such violence This is something the Democrats should understand given former president Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton s botched efforts toinfluencethe Honduras military coup of 2009 In fact, that event, which brought to power a far right strongman, Pepe Lobo Sosa, goes far at explaining the caravan now ascending upon the US border In short, if the West would simply stop pursuing war and chaos around the world, much of which is based on avarice and empire building, the question of stronger borders would no longer be an issue, and those innocent people now in the firing line of NATO armies could rest easily knowing they can build prosperous lives in their own countries @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442423-migrants-caravan-midterms-crisis/

Independent journalist Luc Rivet told RT that the vote accomplished little aside from victimizing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose popularity with Hungarians is only likely to increase While the vote s outcome was expected, what was truly shocking was the language used by MEPs and even senior EU officials while denouncing Orban during a debate in parliament on Tuesday European Commission vice president Frans Timmermanssaidthat Orban had chosen a coward s way out by claiming that the EU was targeting the whole of Hungary, rather than just its government MEPs also hurled insults at Orban, with Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, describing the Hungarian leader as a neo fascist Rivet said that these comments revealed an astonishing rift in the bloc s sense of unity The worst that Europe can produce we heard yesterday and today This bullying will go nowhere because Article 7 will never be applied Italy, Austria and Poland will refuse of course that this be applied, at council level, if not at parliament level Laughland also took aim at the report authored by Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini, which was used to determine that there is a clear risk that Hungary could be undermining the values of the European Union He called the report a grotesque exercise in disinformation, which is full of half truths and untruths, which really does great to discredit to the woman who drew it up Rivet echoed a similar sentiment, describing the report authored by Sargentini as a piece of work It s really incredibly aggressive in its content, and she didn t even go to Hungary to make this report She only relied upon sources like Mr George Soros and his friends So really it s incredible For Laughland, Sargentini s report illustrates two very distinct European worldviews When you compare it to the Hungarian government s response, you can see that you are dealing on the one hand with intelligence, with people who are intelligent and civilized, and on the other hand with someone who is stupid and malicious And in a way I think that s the most frightening aspect of it this conflict between intelligence and stupidity, or between civilized behavior and nastiness ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/438316-eu-hungary-article-seven-crazy/

Article 7 proceedings have never got as far as the MEP vote before Hungary, it is the next step that looks impassible The European Council, which represents the heads of all the 28 states, would have

Astonishment was the word Budapest s Central European University (CEU) used inresponseto the government s measures without any justification or antecedent first proposed last year and outlined in detail earlier this month The 44 students enrolled in the master s program at the George Soros backed university would be allowed to complete their courses, alongside the 10 person intake at the state funded ELTE, the only other Hungarian university to teach the discipline But from next year onwards, the ministry of education will not spend public funds on gender studies, nor award diplomas for completing a degree (though CEU students can continue to study for the English language US certified degree) READ MORE: Christian democracy to crush multiculturalism in EU vote next year Hungary s Orban The decision places Hungary radically at odds with the rest of the Western world From Croatia to Ireland, every other EU state has at least one functioning gender studies program, and in the US, the number has risen threefold in the last three decades, with courses offered at over 350 higher learning institutions But perhaps more astonishing than the closure itself is the honesty with which the government is justifying its decision Although officials statements mention low enrollment, financial expediency, and real world applicability of gender studies diplomas, they have made it explicit that this is an ideological decision first and foremost For the first time in decades, a democratic country has made an explicit pushback against the left wing drift of academia The subject of the discipline goes against everything the government thinks about human beings, Bence Retvari, the minister of human resources and one of the ideologues of the proposal,toldparliament last year Gender studies îsimilarly to Marxism Leninism îcan be called an ideology rather than a science, and therefore it is doubtful that it attains the scientific level expected for a university degree course It can be argued that rather than being like Marxism Leninism, gender studies are in fact Marxism Leninism, founded on feminist theory and intersected with the latest left wing sociology and political science Here is asampleof the areas of specialization from the CEU course website: Gender Dimensions of Post State Socialism; Feminist Knowledge Production; Activism, Social Movements and Policy; Gendering Theory It is, frankly, doubtful that it is possible to meaningfully engage with (or even critique) most of these topics without contentious pre existing ideological suppositions And having emerged from their own traumatic history of totalitarian socialism, Viktor Orban s nationalists do not want to see their homeland re infected with a new strain they see as wreaking havoc in Sweden or Germany This study does not help in raising our nation; moreover it destroys value oriented thinking that is still present in the Central European countries Our burning problem is the demographic issue, which will not be solved by studying sexual minorities and deepening feminist philosophy, Lorinc Nacsa of the ruling coalition Christian Democratswroteto ELTE after it unveiled its gender studies course last year Stripped of the initial shock value, this perspective is at least understandable For the current government, the growth of a self perpetuating cottage industry of gender studies faculties around the world is no more a justification of their legitimacy than the popularity of alchemy at medieval universities is proof that base metals can be turned into gold And this fits in perfectly with Orban s vision of his provocatively named illiberal democracy, for which he has been given mandate by an overwhelming victory in April s election But the line between a robust democracy that refuses to shepherd its electorate into a narrow corridor of acceptable social views, and outright authoritarianism is not an impermeable one, particularly in a new, and still relatively fragile, social order such as post Communist Hungary ELTE issued an extendedstatementin which it accused the government of violating the constitution, and pointed out that its studies have specific societal uses, such as understanding the impacts of an economic crisis on women, or the social effect that many Hungarian women going abroad for childcare jobs has had on the men left behind at home ELTE also said the government did not directly inform them of the proposed changes, and demanded a consultation that would hopefully result in a compromise Gabor Bencsik, the pro government editor in chief of the Hungarian Chronicle, alsocalledon the ruling coalition to re evaluate its arrogant decision, saying that gender studies courses are not in themselves against traditional values, and could be used to ask questions such as Is it possible to boost the birthrate? or How can men and women in families better relate to their children?

Then it means that we are going in the right direction The wind has changed for [Soros] and for all those who have profited from the deaths of hundreds of people Soros, at a sprightly 87 years old, did not waste the opportunity while in Italy to express his indignation towards Donald Trump, the US leader who was also smuggled into power, according to the Democrats and various Russophobes, by the Kremlin Once again, the underlying message here is that the Americans, like the Italians, are simply incapable of formulating any sort of an intelligent opinion for themselves After 12 years of war and stagnant economic growth under former presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, the US electorate should have been simply ecstatic over the possibility of Hillary Clinton, yet another pro war establishment figure, getting into the White House And if things somehow turned out otherwise indeed, as they most certainly did well, it must have been due to the Russians According to this delightful bit of absurdity, Russian trolls managed to swing themulti billion dollarUS presidential election in their favor due to a few hundred tweets and Facebook advertisements And yes, there are people who actually buy that story By refusing to admit that failure is an integral part of the democratic process, individuals like George Soros and Hillary Clinton will simply lie, cheat and hoodwink the system media, judicial and political until they get their way And that is precisely what is now happening in the United States Despite Russiagate disintegrating into an embarrassing he said, she said National Enquirer expose, complete with an adult film star, Trump continues to be embroiled in an investigation that has entered its second year The crazy can be expected to continue at least until congressional midterms in November If the Democrats are able to clinch victory, the world will most likely be treated to many months, maybe years, of impeachment proceedings against the most controversial political figure to grace the halls of Washington in a long time Say what you will about Trump, but the fact that the establishment will go to such incredible lengths to discredit him means they genuinely fear him Why is a completely different question There is an upside to all of this madness, at least as far as Russia is concerned By continually and predictably resorting to the Russia card whenever things don t go their way, which has been rather frequently of late, people like Soros and Clinton, the so called globalists, only serve to cheapen and invalidate their transparent agenda Ironically, Soros borrowed exactly the same argument against Russia that the Clinton campaign used: The Kremlin is trying to weaken the EU What impeccable logic! The fact is that, if Putin or anyone else was really interested in weakening the EU or the US (if such a thing were even possible), they would not trouble themselves by putting populist politicians in power, who would work to reverse the rot of unregulated immigration, and other such irritants In fact, they would just let Soros and his merry band of mischief makers continue doing exactly what they have been doing all along: destroy the EU from within with a disastrous agenda In closing, it bears mentioning that President Putin justsigned a lawmandating the implementation of counter sanctions against any state or person involved in hostile actions ùagainst Russia Whether that legislation works to tame the anti Russia hysteria now inflaming the planet with fake news remains to be seen @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428811-soros-italy-putin-eu/

"1 Jun, 2018",Brussels sees threat to democracy everywhere liberals don‚Äôt win ‚Äì Hungarian foreign minister,"The EU doesn t know how to deal with its member Hungary, where the strong prime minister, Orban, dares to defy Brussels vision for the future How will Hungary hold up under pressure and how will this dispute shape the EU? We talked to the foreign minister of the country, P√©ter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, it s really good to have you on our programme again Welcome back P√©ter Szijjart√≥:It s my honour Thanks for letting me be here ss: Lots to talk about There are tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over the rights of the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Ukraine And you have said that Ukraine stabbed Hungary in the back ù What is Hungary s reaction going to be? ps: Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the European Union to help the Ukrainians to get the visa free regime and to make the EU Ukraine Association agreement to come into force And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine ss: So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn t abide by Ukrainian laws Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? ps: Well, you know, we are part of the alliance So it s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro Atlantic integration path And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission ss: So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? ps: There s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the European Union about how we see this situation We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations We will see whether there s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that ss: Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs You ve said those are lies Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? ps: We had and we re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti migration policy We made it very clear that it s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary It s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together We don t want to let neither the European Union nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don t want to invite We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context ss: Are they groundless? ps: Yeah, absolutely I mean, just let me give you two examples All these accusations say that there s no media freedom in Hungary But if you look in the Internet, for example, if you look at the web pages you will see that anti government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country In some Western European countries it did happen Or when it comes to anti Semitism it s a constant accusation against us Although we re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti Semitism There s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well It s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets ss: in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely ps: and compared to that we re always under accusations ss: Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights Could it come to that? ps: There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland We opposed that because we absolutely think it s based on double standards When you take facts into consideration there s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court So these are all closed issues So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary ss: So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn t meet those demands whether it s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: We may not fund you in the next EU budget ù Here s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to † 6 percent of your budget First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr Orban said: We don t need German money anyways ù ps: Well, you know, Hungary s interest is the European Union to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong European Union We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the European Union We have an export to GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the European Union to be strong and to have a competitive economy On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy But this is not a one way road We don t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends These funds are to be given to us based on contracts Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit This is one lane of the road And the other lane of the road is the European funding So, this is not a one way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation We totally reject that false context, we re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free This is not true We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies ss: There s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland the East vs West because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point I don t think Brussels likes it † What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? ps: We re absolutely interested in the unity of the European Union We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the European Union because the European Union must show unity Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let s put it this way, well, it s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the European Union We are the two countries where a one party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country We have absolutely stable political systems Many times it s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels There s a big debate in the European Union whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because ss: yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration That s what France and Germany want Do you think it s a viable thing? ps: Our position is that European Union can only be strong if there are strong member states So we don t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong European Union would be realistic We think that only strong member states can form a strong European Union That s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the European Union, meaning that we don t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes But the answer shouldn t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes ss: Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the European Union as an alliance of sovereign states European Union is the union that crosses state boundaries It s, like, the core principle of the European Union European Union is based on the principles of liberalism Your country is a nation based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing Russia s same way On ideological level there are so many differences In a basis it s not even economics Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? ps: Well, actually, it s not everything ss: But core things ps: Yeah, but if you look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we re somewhere in the middle, so, there s nothing extraordinary in this regard We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course That s why what we re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit based society There are debates about that as well But all in all our interest is the strong European Union because within the strong European Union Hungary can be strong ss: There s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are sandbags ù that can be thrown away Could it come to that? ps: Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the Visegrad countries are members of the European Union and will be members of the European Union Even more than that This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the European Union Our growth rate is much higher than the European average Everybody speaks about the German French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness But if you look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the European Union because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the European Union being strong as well That s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us ss: The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions There s the center Brussels, France and Germany who want more integration and maybe a two speed Europe It s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now Something needs to change We don t really know what Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won t be as integrated as France and Germany? ps: If you mean that the European Union is faced with historic challenges, you re right Not only one We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with So that s why I think it s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the European Union because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states For instance, take the migration issue Hungary s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country ss: I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway What s the point of being so tough on it if you were going to secretly accept those people anyway? ps: These are two totally different things Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth These two things shouldn t be confused because these are two different issues ss: The mood in the European Union in general is changing Austria has the first anti immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it s pretty much center right as well Do you feel like saying we ve told you so, we ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying ù? ps: You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the European Union the main issue was migration That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti migration policies You ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who s definitely representing an anti migration policy In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti migration parties In Hungary we ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior And you ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn t serve the target of a better future of the European Union ss: So how come so many countries in the EU are anti immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that Just as many countries are against anti Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending † them all of them agree silently to extend them Why can t you be as firm on anti Russia sanctions? ps: Well, if you ask me whether there are double standards I would say yes ù We are a small country And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here If you come to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries If you see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents If you look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved If you look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised If you ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are There s a big debate in the European Union whether the sanctions were successful or not But definitely the unity of the European Union is very important ss: Even if it is at the expense of the anti Russian sanctions? ps: that s why the prolongation of the sanctions has already been decided upon But it s interesting to come here to see the big Western European companies making business with the Russian counterparts ss: You know, we re open to anyone who wants to come and make business with us Thank you very much for this interview, Foreign Minister Good luck with everything ps: Thank you I really do appreciate it RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/428412-hungary-eu-pressure-deal/

Why does it not say that we must recognise those counter cyclical problems, and will certainly do so if unemployment grows by X per cent? Instead of having merely three percent and 60 percent for borrowing and debt, why not have three, four or five percent of the level of unemployment or the fall in gross domestic product? ù The problem is not that the idea of a single currency for European countries is a bad one It s the way the whole thing was implemented Perhaps the architects of the Maastricht Treaty thought that with the demise of the Soviet Union they could restructure Europe s economies to be more banker friendly The center left meanwhile could be bought off with add on measures such as the Social Chapter †But what s the use of the Social Chapter if you don t have a job to go to in the first place?

Are election results in the EU only legitimate when the outcome suits Brussels?

So, 13 Russians allegedly planted ideas on popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where crazy ideas already abound There never was any evidence in the indictment that even suggested any Russian attempt to manipulate through hacking voting stations The alleged disinformation campaign amounted to calls for demonstrations or the printing of ads, which in many instances were hilarious Certainly, discerning and naturally skeptical Americans know the difference and have never thought that alternative ideas were a threat to the US democratic system, whether it s by Russians or even American billionaires who use their fortunes to try and alter the US political process Indeed, ongoing congressional investigations reveal something even more sinister in the US democratic process Namely, that the Clinton campaign paid for a so called Russian dossier to undermine the Trump campaign and it was done in actual collusion with high level officials of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation This is unprecedented in US politics and is tantamount to the action of a police state And it was perpetrated by Democrats who concocted the Russian collusion scheme to discredit the legitimacy of the Trump election If the US was inferring in the indictment that 13 Russian individuals sought to undermine the entire American democratic process, it is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black, since there are stark examples of past US efforts to interfere in elections and, indeed, overthrow democratically elected governments of other countries Many of those past instances continue to have a major adverse impact on US influence in foreign policy In 1953, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh The impact culminated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and has affected what there is of US Iranian relations to this day During the administration of President Richard Nixon, he and his then national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, were involved in the1973coup of democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende Once again, the CIA was involved in the Chilean military s ousting of Allende, which then committed atrocities on its own citizens In his 90s today, Kissinger continues to give President Trump foreign policy advice Fast forward to modern day efforts to affect the outcome of elections in other countries, former president Barack Obama s repeated efforts to interfere in the elections of other nations are more numerous than most past US presidents Ironically, the mainstream media played down those efforts Among those examples, during the 2015 election in Israel, the Obama administration illegally attempted to prevent the re election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to major personal and policy differences The administration covertly funneled State Departmentgrantsto opposition groups to the tune of some $350,000, including a group called the One Voice Movement One of Obama s field directors from his last presidential campaign actually oversaw the operation in an effort to topple the Netanyahu government As usual, no one was held accountable In 2014, the Obama administration was instrumental in supporting and helping to finance the violent overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych To further underscore Obama s involvement in the internal affairs of another country, the American Spectatorreportedthat the government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, had obtained government documents showing that the US government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected,

change in Libya Last, but not least, is the example of former President George W Bush s 2003 invasion of Iraq, which led to the violent overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein As in the case of the 1953 coup in Iran, the US experience in Iraq has had a lasting impact on American influence not only in that country but throughout the entire Middle East Ironically, US law prohibits the use of

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// tdotco /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director

policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems

"25 Oct, 2017",‚ÄòRT is accused & guilty of providing content that appeals to people‚Äô,"People wouldn t be watching RT if it was not providing high quality news content and a much needed alternative viewpoint amid a mainstream media monopoly, media experts have told RT, noting that baseless criticism only fuels the channel s popularity On Monday, the New York Times (NYT) accused YouTube of having a cozy ùrelationship with RT, and which the publication believes, has contributed to the rise of the RT s popularity on the world s most visited video sharing site Thearticleclaims that YouTube has played a crucial role ùin helping RT expand and significantly grow its audience base Unacceptable! RT pulled from YouTube prime ad list in US without notice They had to attribute it to some form of collaboration or weird dealings because they couldn t just accept that RT is doing well by providing people [with] content that people will watch, ùMatteo Bergamini, the founder of independent youth news platform Shout Out UK, told RT Independent journalist Derrick Droze agreed that the only thing the NYT succeeded in doing with its latest piece, is in fact, praising RT s quality content and efficient partnership with YouTube It is kind of silly to see the New York Times and US government take this position because essentially what they are accusing RT of doing is knowing how to work YouTube, and knowing how to work algorithms and how to work content that appeals to people, ùDroze told RT The way the article is written is so silly They re just talking about that RT created content and it reached a young audience of people who want authenticity and who want real news, and who want news outside the US government s version of events, ùthe journalist added In particular, the NYT article criticized the compliments RT attracted from Robert Kyncl, who was YouTube s vice president at the time when RT smashed through the billion views milestone In particular, Kyncl emphasized that RT offers authentic ùnews content instead of agendas or propaganda, ùwhich helps the outlet to bond with its viewers I think what users generally appreciate is authenticity It is very apparent from everything that is going on on Youtube So instead of having aspirational programming or agendas and propaganda, people really respond to authenticity, ùKyncl told RT s Kevin Owen in 2013 The media experts agree with Kyncl s assessment offered years ago RT is popular because it services people, because people find it interesting, not because of some kind of brainwashing or collusion, ùlegal and media analyst Lionel said In fact, YouTube hascontinuedto commend RT s content selection, production and audience retention throughout the years †RTrocketedto 5 billion views on YouTube in September, maintaining its undisputed leadership position among international news networks, and

outlets provided no concrete examples to back its claims Log out of Facebook Delete your Twitter Sleep with one eye open Russians are everywhere (Op Ed by Danielle Ryan)https: // tdotco /cDXBiqQs4B This kind of reporting by the WSJ and the NYT is tantamount to a witch hunt, ù Bergamini believes It s a witch hunt for anybody that has any relationship with anything to do with Russia or anything Russian it seems, ùBergamini said [To say] that RT because they were successful on YouTube is somehow embedded with YouTube and therefore Google is just madness [They] are choking out accusations without any real evidence whatsoever ù In a recent drive to somehow tarnish the public view of RT, a lobby group funded by George Soros, along with the EU and US governments, targeted 2,327 people who appeared as experts and guests on RT The report by the European Values think tank states that appearing on RT is counterproductive and makes the guest a useful idiot ùto a hostile foreign power ùExpressing one s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to complicity with the Russian propaganda machine ù But people are not idiots, ùand consciously chose to watch and appear on RT because the channel s content stands out from the mainstream media, argued Ray Finch, an MEP from the UK Independence Party (UKIP) The fact of the matter is: ordinary people know where to get their news They can choose anywhere they like It seems that RT is giving some form of news that people like, and so people are consuming it If they didn t like it, they are not forced to watch it, they can go and watch CNN or Al Jazeera or read the NYT online, ùFinch told RT CNN is known worldwide now as the Clinton News Network, the BBC is the voice of the remainers as far as Brexit is concerned, Russia Today is what it says on the tin, it is backed by Russia People take that into account The NYT and people like that are assuming people are idiots, ùFinch said Boris says Labour MPs speaking to RT is a scandal despite his dad appearing only last month Just last week, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed that it was a scandal ùfor Labour MPs to appear on RT However, every time RT makes western media headlines, the reaction to the popularity of the channel only seems to grow, Lionel noted If I didn t know better, I would swear RT is working on one of the most incredible stealth PR programs ever Every time the New York Times or the Washington Post or anybody else does some expos√© about RT, it makes people in this country even more interested and more fascinated with what RT does, ùLionel pointed out Since RT registered on YouTube in 2007, the network has been constantly expanding its online presence, bringing to its viewers the latest and most viral news in a wide range of video formats, while exploring new designs Last year, RT broke new ground in posting the first 360 degree HD video from aboard the International Space Station RT s most popular videos over the last year include Donald Trump s victory speech after winning the presidential election, an interview with the President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, and a documentary about a hitman who worked for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar RT s goal is, and has always been, to inform The hysteria surrounding such mundane activities as RT s social media advertising of its content î something done by

Are our guests useful idiots, ù in your opinion? Daniel McAdams:I was looking through the list of guests who are Russian dupes and I see Dick Cheney, I see Joe Lieberman, I see Lindsey Graham, I see Michael Morell So, the Russians agents are at very top of the US government Even the leading anti Russia figures are in fact Russian agents I think we must hide under our beds because it is terrifying But I would say more seriously, what this is [it s] an attempt to stifle any views that go outside the accepted US neocon foreign policy of intervention It is ironic that it is a Czech think tank doing this This well may have come out from the old StB the old Czechoslovakian intelligence service, which did its best to keep Czechs from hearing any kind of foreign policy information that deviated from their own government s communist line This sounds a lot like that RT:Do you think some guests might be deterred from appearing on RT? DM: I think that is the intent Let s look at this: the reason I made a point of it earlier on the guests they had this is not designed to inform individuals; this is not designed to inform it is designed to propagandize, it is designed to intimidate; it is designed to isolate I am certainly not here to defend RT I am not here to defend Russia What I am here to defend, though, is the marketplace of ideas RT provides a platform for individuals who do not buy into the neocon US foreign policy line to have a voice I have never been asked at RT what I am going to say beforehand Any time I ve gone on the mainstream media, or attempted to, I have a long, sometimes 20 or 30 minute, interview beforehand, and often I am told my comments are not needed So, what we need in a free society is a marketplace of ideas that you maybe disagree with, but you should have the right to hear How ironic that the United States government is funding an organization that is restricting the Americans ability to hear different views outside the US government view RT:You re a regular guest on RT How do you feel about being described in the report as a useful idiot ? Annie Machon:I think we should wear it as a badge of honor, because it shows that there is a group of people out there, who are not afraid to challenge the Western consensus perhaps we should have a club, who knows I would say, though, more seriously, that I have been appearing on mainstream media news outlets for the last 20 years around the planet, and my perspective, my stance has remained absolutely resolute and absolutely the same I have the same respective, same opinions on all sorts of different outlets And it is only when I appear on RT that apparently I am now deemed to be a useful idiot ù I would also say, as well, that RT is one of the very few TV channels that, when it invites me on to do an interview, they do not insist on a pre interview to censor and vet what I might be about to say Many other TV channels do, because they are scared and they want to make sure that they are in control of what their guests are saying Yet, I still appear on many other TV channels Perhaps what I am saying is not being Putin s useful idiot, ùperhaps it is just an alternative perspective that people need to hear RT:The report says our guests undermine Western democracy and pollute the information space Is that what you re up to when you re on the air with us? AM:Absolutely not I am trying to put forward my perspective, my opinions, based on 25 years of expertise within certain fields, and I feel I do that professionally Obviously other news outlets feel I do it professionally too, because I get re invited back to all of those, too So, it is just a case of freedom of expression Propaganda campaign by European Values :Paul Vallely, retired US army general RT:Your name is among those on the list How do you feel about being described in the report as a useful idiot ù? Paul Vallely:It seems like a propaganda campaign by European Values, ù whatever European values means today I was with Fox News for eight years I probably have done many thousands of shows and interviews on national security, military and so on, but I ve never been called a useful idiot ù I am sure they wouldn t bring me back on if I was an idiot It s ridiculous The worst of Times: Establishment paper keeps up attack on RT over London tube ads https: // tdotco /6YyUcU8uHV RT:Why is there so much Western governmental pressure on RT right now?

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of colorrevolution s ù around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first colorrevolution , ùa technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed There is just one problem None of it is true The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned ùfrom Communism and despoiled in the process Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed ù the creation of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election Meanwhile, a student movement called Otpor (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US trained activists, like Srda Popovic Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience Suitcases of cash ù smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5 Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum As a result, ƒêindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist ù expediency Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre or post electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the orangerevolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, colorrevolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences there is always the next revolution to plan and execute And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator ù(there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems Before the dust from the revolution clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters While the colorrevolution s are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago Nebojsa Malic for RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/
"11 Sep, 2017",Korean nuclear tension: Apocalypse... almost now,"The saber rattling and harsh rhetoric during the current nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula should remind mankind of something we have forgotten Atomic weapons are terrifying things, and talk of using them should be a taboo subject is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London A week or so ago, I found myself reading Agatha Christie s 80th, and penultimate, book, Passenger to Frankfurt, and its relevance to today struck me The book was published in 1970, with the subtitle an extravaganza, ùis an utter failure and was often characterized as an incomprehensible muddle ù; however, this muddle is not due to Christie s old age or senility: instead, its causes are clearly political Passenger to Frankfurt is Christie s most personal, intimately felt, and at the same time most political novel It expresses her personal confusion, her feeling of being totally at a loss with what was going on in the world in the late 1960s the drugs, the sexual revolution, student protests, murders, etc So it s no wonder that Passenger to Frankfurt is not a detective novel There is no murder, no logic, and deduction This feeling of the collapse of the elementary cognitive mapping, this overwhelming fear of chaos, is rendered precisely in Christie s introduction to the novel: Hold up a mirror to 1970 in England Look at that front page every day for a month, make notes, consider and classify Every day there is a killing A girl strangled An elderly woman attacked and robbed of her meager savings Young men or boys attacking or attacked Buildings and telephone kiosks smashed and gutted Drug smuggling Robbery and assault Children missing and children s murdered bodies found not far from their homes Can this be England? Is England really like this? Not yet, but it could be Fear is awakening, a fear of what may be And not only in our own country There are smaller paragraphs on other pages giving news from Europe, from Asia, from the Americas, in Worldwide News Hi jacking of planes Kidnapping Violence Riots Hate Anarchy All growing stronger All seeming to lead to worship of destruction, pleasure in cruelty What does it all mean? ù Is our era with † leaders ù †like Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? So what does all this mean? In the novel, Christie provides her answer a terrible worldwide conspiracy which has something to do with Richard Wagner and The Young Siegfried We learn that, toward the end of World War II, Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war He then escaped to Argentina where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel The Young Siegfried ùMeanwhile, in the book s present, drugs, promiscuity, and student protests are all secretly caused by Nazi agitators who want to bring about anarchy so that they can restore Nazi domination on a world scale This terrible worldwide conspiracy ùis, of course, ideological fantasy at its purest: a weird condensation of the fear of extreme right and extreme left The least we can say to Christie s credit is that she locates the heart of the conspiracy to the extreme right (neo Nazis) and not in any of the other usual suspects (Communism, Jews, Muslims, etc ) The idea neo Nazis were behind the 68 student protesters and sexual liberation struggle, with its obvious madness, nonetheless bears witness to the disintegration of a consistent cognitive mapping of our predicament Christie is compelled to take refuge in such a crazy paranoiac construct as the only way to introduce some order and meaning into the utter confusion and panic she found herself in But is her vision really too crazy to be taken seriously? Is our era with leaders ùlike Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? Our situation is messy in a way very similar to the one described by Christie: a rightist government enforcing workers rights (in Poland), a leftist government pursuing the strictest austerity politics (in Greece) Thus, it s no wonder that, to regain a minimal cognitive mapping, Christie resorts to WWII, the last good war, ùretranslating our mess into its coordinates One should nonetheless note how the very form of Christie s answer (one big secret agent behind it all) strangely mirrors the fascist idea of the Jewish conspiracy: how there is one big Nazi plot behind which lies the explanation to everything And, today, the extreme populist right proposes a similar explanation of the Muslim immigrant threat ùIn antisemitic imaginary, the Jew ùis the invisible master who secretly pulls the strings, which is why Muslim immigrants are NOT today s Jews: they are all too visible, not invisible They are clearly not integrated into our societies, and nobody claims they secretly pull strings if one sees in their invasion of Europe ùa secret plot, then Jews have to be behind it As was the case in a text that recently appeared in one of the main Slovenian Rightist weekly journals where we could read: George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time, ùresponsible for the invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU as a typical Talmudo Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of Western civilization, the nation state and white, European man ù His goal is to build a rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work hating cultural Marxists, ùwhich would then perform a deconstruction of the nation state, and transform the EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe ùFurthermore, Soros is inconsistent in his promotion of multiculturalism: He promotes it exclusively in Europe and the USA, while in the case of Israel, he, in a way which is for me totally justified, agrees with its monoculturalism, latent racism and building a wall In contrast to the EU and USA, he also does not demand from Israel to open its borders and accept refugees A hypocrisy appropriate to Talmudo Zionism ù[Quoted from Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç, George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time (in Slovene), Demokracija, August 25 2016, p 15 ] Is this disgusting fantasy which brings together antisemitism and Islamophobia so different from the one staged by Christie? Are they both not a desperate attempt to orient oneself in confused times? The extreme oscillations in the public perception of the Korean crisis are significant as such One week we are told we are on the brink of nuclear war, then there is a week of respite, then the war threat explodes again When I visited Seoul in August 2017, my friends there told me there is no significant threat of a war since the North Korean regime knows it cannot survive it, but now the South Korean authorities are preparing the population for a nuclear war In such a situation, where the apocalypse is on the horizon, one should bear in mind the standard logic of probability no longer applies, we need a different logic, described by Jean Pierre Dupuy: The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as destiny, for sure, but also as a contingent accident if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example, it could not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not occur, it is not inevitable It is thus the event s actualization the fact that it takes place which retroactively creates its necessity ù[ Jean Pierre Dupuy, Petite metaphysique des tsunami, Paris: Seuil 2005, p 19 ] Dupuy provides the example of the French presidential elections in May 1995; here is the January forecast of the main polling Institute: If on next May 8th, Mr (√âdouard) Balladur will be elected, one can say the presidential election was decided before it even took place ù The moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities When applied to the recent tension in Korea, this means: IF the war explodes, it will be necessary and inevitable; IF war will not explode, it was all a false alarm This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of nuclear (or ecological) catastrophe: not to realistically ùappraise the possibilities of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on the background of this acceptance, we should mobilize ourselves to perform the act which will change destiny itself and thereby insert a new possibility into the situation Instead of saying the future is still open, we still have the time to act and prevent the worst, ù one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable, and then work to undo what is already written in the stars ùas our destiny What is needed is no less than a new global anti nuclear movement, a global mobilization that would exert pressure on nuclear powers and act aggressively, organizing mass protests and boycotts, while denouncing our leaders as criminals and the like It should focus not only on North Korea but also on those super powers who assume the right to monopolize nuclear weapons The very public mention of the use of nuclear weapons should be treated as a criminal offense And more than that, a global change in our stance is needed, what Peter Sloterdijk calls the domestication of the wild animal culture ù Till now, each culture disciplined and educated its own members and guaranteed civic peace among them in the guise of state power, but the relationship between different cultures and states was permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each state of peace nothing more than a temporary armistice As Hegel conceptualized it, the entire ethic of a state culminates in the highest act of heroism, the readiness to sacrifice one s life for one s nation state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within a state Is today s North Korea with its ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons, and rockets to deliver them to distant targets, not the ultimate example of this logic of unconditional nation state sovereignty? However, the moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities A task rendered all the more difficult by the ongoing rise of sectarian religious and ethnic heroic ùviolence and readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one s specific cause The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/402959-korean-nuclear-christie-apocalypse-zizek/
"8 Sep, 2017","More than 140,000 Americans sign petition against George Soros, but will it make a difference?","A petition to the White House calling for Hungarian American billionaire George Soros to be declared a terrorist has garnered more than 140,000 signatures, far exceeding the 100,000 needed to require an official response from the administration is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin

has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Thepetition, which also calls on the government to seize all of Soros assets, argues the billionaire has willfully and on an ongoing basis attempted to destabilize and otherwise commit acts of sedition ùagainst the United States Also that he has developed unhealthy and undue influence over the entire Democrat Party and a large portion of the US Federal government ù Whatever about the terrorist ùpart, it is at least true that Soros maintains an unhealthy influence over the Democratic Party, as well as political systems around the world besides the United States Soros was Hillary Clinton s top donor in the 2016 election and has for decades used his vast wealth to influence politics, stir discontent and profit off chaos in countries under the guise of philanthropy and humanitarianism But Soros (and many of his beneficiaries) represent a disturbing hypocrisy Claiming to support and promote democracy the world over, Soros actions consistently undermine it Or, as one writer for The Observerput it: there is nothing philanthropic about drowning a democracy in money ù Drowning a democracy in money is exactly what Soros does î and it has very little to do with philanthropy, fairness or social conscience Soros funded Democrats routinely attack anyone who truly dares to challenge the system that allows a few billionaires to maintain far more control over democracies ù than the regular people who live and vote in them Look no further than the vicious attacks on Bernie Sanders î a candidate who at least had the integrity toshunthe Super PACS he believes are infecting American democracy Even after her loss to Donald Trump, Clinton is still taking aim at Sanders î a man who endorsed her despite revelations that she and a supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee secretly worked in cahoots to scuttle his massively popular campaign Soros has been eulogized by the left and reviled by the right As such, much of the criticism of him is found on right leaning websites and blogs, while the liberal mainstream steers clear î a distinct contrast with how they treat billionaires like the Koch brothers who funnel billions into the pockets of Republicans The Americans signing the petition are unhappy about Soros funding of movements like Black Lives Matter and hislinksto violent far left groups Some of the more conspiracy minded believe Soros himself orchestrated and funded both sides of the violent protests in Charlottesville last month Many of Soros critics take legitimate criticism too far, either by accusing him of being behind anything and everything that irks them or by using antisemitic slurs against him This allows Soros defenders to then paint anyone who takes issue with him as a crazy and antisemitic Soros himself falls into a similar trap, however, when he tries to pin all the world s ills and evils on Vladimir Putin The result is only to make himself look stupid But there s another interesting twist at play here While Americans of a certain political stripe have every right to be upset with Soros and his efforts to influence politics in the US, they are often strangely quiet when he does it overseas Neither are many of them particularly interested when their own government engages in the same exact behavior (often in league with Soros himself) to promote revolution ù and overthrow foreign governments In fact, when Washington engages in this kind of behavior, they are often more than willing to cheer it on Accusing Soros of funding fake news ù Nazis in Charlottesville is one thing, but when he helped the US government install real Nazis into power Ukraine in 2014, not many Americans on either the left or right were too bothered They certainly weren t signing petitions calling for their government to be labeled a terrorist state, anyway Strange indeed, how acts of sedition ùare something to take seriously only when you think they might affect you and your own political agenda But Soros, famed for his liberal politics, has no qualms using his $25 billion fortune to fund conservatives either Take, for example, the $100,000 hedonatedto top Senate warmonger John McCain s legacy ù foundation, which also accepted $1 million from Saudi Arabia A credible collection of democracy loving philanthropists, indeed A skeptic might cynically surmise that Soros is not really a bleeding heart liberal and altruist after all, but a billionaire willing to throw money at whoever he believes will preserve the system that made him rich The chances the White House will take this petition seriously are basically zero Liberals, conservatives, it doesn t matter; the lot of them are all knee deep in the same dung Soros and Trump may hate each other insofar as their political worldviews differ, but what matters to them more than anything is money Public fights

"14 Aug, 2017",‚ÄòBrink of civil war‚Äô? American divide reaches boiling point under Trump,"The divide in America existed long before Trump took office, but he s the one who will have to deal with the aftermath of the largest gathering of white nationalists in a decade, which resulted in clashes and a car attack called an act of terrorism ù In recent years, America has witnessed the rise of the#BlackLivesMattermovement, which started in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed black teen was shot by a white police officer Occupy Wall Street, which began in New York City in 2011, also transformed into a nationwide mass protest movement, with the aim of drawing attention to economic injustice and political corruption Trump s own inauguration was marked by nationwide protests, revealing deep divisions in the US on a range of issues, such as health care, gun control, immigration, and climate change This week in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Unite the Right rally saw white supremacists clashing with counter protesters, resulting in at least three deaths A woman was killed and dozens were injured in a car ramming attack at a counter protest Two police officers were also killed as a helicopter monitoring the protests crashed in the woods near Charlottesville There are deeply conflicting opinions regarding what is taking place with the protest movements and related violence in the country, and who is responsible for it RT looks at a variety of voices across the political spectrum A common idea among the political left is that the election of President Donald Trump and his Make America Great Again campaign have emboldened ùfar right groups in the US This is also seen as a general trend in the Western world, with right wing parties becoming more prominent than they have been in decades Author and historian Gerald Horne says there has been a mushrooming and skyrocketing of the number of white supremacist organizations and incidents spearheaded by white supremacists ùsince Donald Trump was elected When they look across the Atlantic, they see the credible effort by Marine Le Pen and the National Front in France to claim the presidency, they look to Germany and see the rise of the Alternative for Germany party which has ultra right tendencies to put it mildly, they look at Norway and see the rise of right wing populists throughout Scandinavia This is putting wind in the sails of right wing populists here in the US, who have one of their own, Donald J Trump, now occupying the Oval Office, ùHorne said Horne believes that the heart of the Trump electoral base still has hatred for black people, ùand that white nationalists in America are now flexing their muscles ù However, the position of the nationalist groups is clearly not as comfortable as it may sound, with radical left groups such as Antifa staging mass counter protests and clashing with far right protesters, whether they identify as neo Nazi or alt right The right wing camp believes the clashes are not spontaneous, and that they often stem from well organized provocations Earlier this year, anti fascists clashed with alt right activists in Berkeley, California in series of violent protests over the planned appearances of high profile conservative figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter, which were eventually cancelled Lawyer and filmmaker Mike Cernovich spoke to RT about the wave of protests in the US What we saw [in Charlottesville] is a part of a broader trend which actually started in what they call in America the Battle of Berkeley There were some of these alt right events, they went to a park and then there were left wing groups called Antifa antifascists but really were not distinguishable from Nazis They got in huge street fights in the middle of Berkeley like nothing I have even seen, ùCernovich said Many conservatives believe that what started as the left simply venting frustration over Trump s victory in the presidential election has now grown into a full fledged political movement aimed at obstructing freedom of speech Cernovich, who says he is no fan of the nationalists behind the Charlottesville protest, believes that the threat of far right groups in the US is overblown, and that the corporate media is using them for their own political agenda Last night they had a torch night, maybe 500 people showed up, if the American media did not show up and say, hey, we will make you all famous, we will put you on the front page of a newspaper, we will promote you if the counter demonstrators and Antifa did not show up looking for a fight, you would have had a couple hundred showing up, having a little event, nobody would have noticed, and they would go away, ùCernovich says, arguing that the media and people like George Soros are feeding this ù Trump is presumed to be a favorite among far right voters, and this notion has often been used to associate the 45th US president to racists, bigots, and white supremacists, and to suggest that he is championing their cause Trump s stated goals, however, were to drain the swamp ùand fight the current US establishment to improve the life of Americans and revitalize America s shaky economy READ

that the president made a regrettable ùchoice in his campaign by courting ùnationalist groups and giving them a reason to come into the light ù Look at the campaign he ran Look at the intentional courting of all these white supremacists, white nationalist groups like that, anti Semitic groups, ùSigner said Sunday on CNN s State of the Union He then told NBC s Meet the Press : When you dance with the devil, the devil doesn t change, the devil changes you ù Many Trump supporters believe that this type of labeling is one of the establishment s ways of discrediting and attacking Trump I think there are elements inside of Washington, also inclusive of the White House, that are not necessarily abetting the president s interests or his agenda, ùformer White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci told ABC s George Stephanopoulos Scaramucci said that the president is not a representative of the political establishment class, so for whatever reason the people have made a decision that they want to eject him ù Scaramucci, however, criticized Trump for not calling out the white supremacists strongly enough, saying that whether it s domestic or international terrorism, with the moral authority of the presidency, you have to call that stuff out ù The White House on Sunday was forced to clarify that the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo Nazi, and all extremist groups He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together ù Following the events in Charlottesville, Trump condemned this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ù The recent escalation has been interpreted as both a reflection of long standing divides in America, as well as a deliberate rocking of the boat by opportunists ùon both sides This sort of feels like the first major confrontation of left vs right directly against one another in the streets of an American city since Donald Trump became president, so there is a lot at stake, ùpolitical cartoonist, Ted Rall told RT This is really embarrassing, as an American I can only look at Charlottesville and say this does not make us look good, and it is really a very bad day for our country ù According to Rall, Trump may be playing into the hands ùof the opportunists by trying to play the egalitarian card and saying that all sides need to be peaceful ù Mike Cernovich believes the opposite, saying that since the inauguration, ùAmerica has been on the brink of civil war, ùand there has been a lot of violence on both sides, ù which is becoming more extreme and more violent ù The recent events are not spontaneous, ùsome experts say, suggesting that it might have been a well prepared development to further polarize people in the US I walked about a mile [this weekend] through places in New York, where there are already protests They don t look

"7 Aug, 2017",Reports of Hungary‚Äôs slide into ‚Äòdictatorship‚Äô have been exaggerated,"Is Hungary sliding into tyranny and dictatorship? According to headlines which have painted a rather grim picture of Hungary s present and future under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the answer is a resounding yes is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Hungary is held hostage ùby tyrant ùOrban who is returning the country to totalitarianism, ùclaims The New Statesman The International Business Times worries about Hungary s dark path toward dictatorship ù The EU struggles to contain dictator ùOrban, says the Sydney Morning Herald Orban is Europe s enemy within, ùwarns the Financial Times He is Europe s New Dictator, ùsays Politico These attention grabbing headlines and dramatic portrayals exaggerate the political situation in Hungary Of course, there are plenty of legitimate complaints to be made about Orban (though, naturally, the specifics of the complaint will vary based on who is speaking) The problem is that the media has taken those complaints, exaggerated and embellished them, and used them to predict this country s slide into absolute tyranny irresponsibly This distorts reality and lessens the readers ability to understand what is going on in Hungary Brussels likes to believe it promotes democracy within the 28 EU member states Yet, when Orban begins to implement policies that they don t like (but that his voters support), he becomes an outcast Those shouting dictator! ùfail to take into account the wishes of the many Hungarians who voted for Orban s reelection in 2014 and who support many of his policies Disregarding the will of the people to score ideological points about democracy is ironic indeed Let s break it down Hungarian PM Orban pledges to support Poland against European inquisition https: // tdotco /9GAoCzB8TE When considering the legitimacy of the claim that Hungary is sliding into dictatorship, we should start with the basics Orban is a legitimately elected prime minister The freeness of recent elections in Hungary has not been called into question Following the latest parliamentary elections in 2014, which saw Orban and his conservative political alliance re elected, there was debate (within Hungary, I should add) over whether undue advantage was given to the ruling Fidesz party through acombination of factors î including gerrymandering districts and biased media reporting No doubt these factors do give an advantage to the ruling party, but it would not be entirely unfair to compare this to the undue advantage afforded to the two mainstream parties in the United States Democrat and Republican candidates enjoy massive free media coverage and an immediate sense of legitimacy, while third party candidates are all but shunned and treated as an amusing sideshow by mainstream media The US regards itself as the greatest democracy in the world As for gerrymandering, it ishardlya Hungarian phenomenon Overall, the OSCE monitors of Hungary s parliamentary electionsconcludedthat Hungarians were offered a genuine choice ùin competitive elections ùThey said the process was transparently and efficiently administered ù The OSCE criticized the partisan composition ùof the National Election Commission and media regulations which favored Fidesz but said the candidate registration process was inclusive Interestingly, Western coveragefocused onlyon the OSCE s criticisms, failing to give a full picture which included improvements to the system Ultimately, when Hungary holds elections, candidates from across the political spectrum win seats î from the governing party, from the left and right wing opposition î and occasionally independents Sometimes the polls predict outcomes accurately, other times they are off None of this is typical of a dictatorship One of the major criticisms of Orban is that he has destroyed free media in Hungary It is true that Hungary s media environment is not free from state interference State media act, by and large, as free advertising and propaganda for Fidesz and Orban There is often pressure put on independent media and Orban allies have been busybuying upmedia outlets Nonetheless, it is completely untrue to suggest that Orban has managed to decimate the free press entirely There are plenty of available outlets that dedicate a lot of their time to bashing the ruling party, online and in print and radio Independent journalists regularly unearth cases of government corruption î and anyone is free to read them Hungarians are more than aware of government corruption and are not happy about it Public opinion in 2016 showed that 56 percent of people believe the government only pursues corruptionselectively In 2014, the governmentshelved a planto introduce a tax on internet data usage after pressure through massive street protests The protesters argued that levying fees on internet usage would restrict access to free information î and the protesters won At the time, the BBCwrotethat Orban was more flexible than many analysts give him credit for ùTypically, street protests don t work in dictatorships If international rankings are your cup of tea, take a look at the 2017 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index Hungary does not rank particularly well î but Greece, Israel and Japanrank worse One of the biggest criticisms of Orban came this year over the controversy surrounding the George Soros founded, Budapest based Central European University The controversy was caused by an amendment to the law on higher education which meant the university would no longer be allowed to issue diplomas accredited in the United States unless it operated a campus there Until now, it has been allowed to do just that This naturally made the university highly marketable to students But non CEU students were at a disadvantage, according to the government s argument The law change was framed as a total and utter assault on freedom Reports in Western publicationsmade it soundas though the university was being forced to shutter its doors on the spot for no reason î or simply because of its association with Orban foe Soros In reality, the university will not be forced to close It will be compelled to comply with a new law which removes part of its competitive advantage (issuing US accreditation) Whether you believe this is fair or not, it is hard to argue the reporting on the controversy gave a full and balanced picture The law prompted huge street protests; some of the biggest Budapest has seen in years There is no question a lot of Hungarians are fired up against Orban over the CEU move But that is not the opinion across the board While on the one hand, I ve seen Hungarians waving signs comparing Orban to Hitler, I ve also spoken to Hungarians who support the amendment to the education law, completely agreeing with the position that CEU should not be afforded any sort special treatment Calling Orban a dictator or tyrant over something like this again disregards widespread opinion in favor of ideological point scoring An opinionpollin May saw the ruling party and Orban s personal support drop since the CEU spat in January î but that could also be to do with other things; like the fact that half of all Hungarians can t afford a one week foreign holiday Israel backs Hungary s anti Soros campaign, saying financier continually undermines Jewish State https: // tdotco /ksOiPRdcQt The policy that has caused Orban to be most reviled by many Western democracies, however, has been his decision to refuse to comply with an EU resettlement plan for hosting refugees across member states But again, Orban is not alone in his thinking A referendum in 2016 saw 98 percent of Hungarian voterssay no to Brussels EU migrant quotas Turnout, however, was low, at about 44 percent î below the 50 percent required to make the referendum valid under the law Orban s commentary on refugees has beeninflammatory; some would argue outright racist But racist and inflammatory commentary doesn t make one a dictator î especially when 98 percent of people who showed up to vote agree with you Regardless, Hungary is pushing ahead with its stance on illegal immigration, even holding those who enter the country in detention centers at the border The government claims it is doing this to uphold the Schengen agreement which is being abused ùas migrants travel freely to reach their country of choice in Western Europe The country also built a fence along its border with Serbia hoping to lower the number of refugee crossings This again is a subject which deeply divides people and ignites passions But believing Orban s policies on migration are cruel or immoral does not make him a dictator What s more, it s ludicrous to ignore that his policies are in line, for the most part, with the will of the people Incidentally, Orban is also accused of fueling extremism and anti Semitism While he certainly does whip up nationalist fervor, it is misleading to call him an anti Semite It israrelypointed out that Orban s government introduced a Holocaust memorial day, compulsory Holocaust education in schools and made Holocaust denial illegal Western reporting frequently fails to give a full picture of the situation in Hungary in much the same way it does about any country that fails to live up to arbitrarily set standards for what constitutes a good or a bad country Unfortunately, some in the Hungarian opposition fuel unbalanced portrayals of the country because the louder they shout, the more vehement Western journalists will shout with them î and the more attention they will receive What I have been struck by, having spent the last ten months in this country, is that this is not the way average Hungarians seem to think of their country Many are of course vehemently anti Orban, many are pro Orban But even those against him are often baffled by Western coverage The late Imre Kertesz, the first Hungarian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature,decried talk of dictatorshipin Hungary as empty ideological language ù In a 2014 interview with The Hungarian Quarterly, Kertesz revealed that a reporter from the New York Times had called him with the intention of getting me to say that Hungary is a dictatorship today, which it isn t ù That only means that he [the reporter] has no idea what a dictatorship is If you can write, speak openly, openly disagree, even leave the country, it is absurd to speak of a dictatorship, ùKertesz said I am not pleased with everything happening in Hungary I do not think there was ever a time when I was pleased with everything happening here but certainly, Hungary is no dictatorship This is empty ideological language to call Hungary a dictatorship today ù Most notably, Kertesz said the interview in which he failed to call his country a dictatorship was never published î and that in itself is a kind of censorship ù Exaggerating Hungary s political situation distorts not only the present but the past To speak of Orban s dictatorship ùis a slap in the face to those who lived and still do live under real dictatorships The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit

"5 Jun, 2017","If George Soros is the answer to the EU crisis, what on earth is the question?","Just as a stopped clock is right twice a day, George Soros, a man who s done more to destabilize countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis Mr Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1 It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars Where Mr Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent ù Soros funded groups are only network following mafia ways in Hungary Orbanhttps: // tdotco /NPoXZlq4e3pic twitter com/CsQoLf1Sle The truth of the matter is that the Soviet Union liberated Europe from fascism, that without the inordinate tenacity and sacrifice of the Soviet Russian people and the Red Army, Hitler would have succeeded in colonizing the continent As US historian Peter Kuznick writes, Up to [D Day, June 1944], the Soviet Union had almost singlehandedly battled the German military Until the invasion of Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten Germany lost over 6 million men on the Eastern Front and approximately one million on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean ù Returning to Mr Soros speech we are regaled with the assertion that the EU is surrounded by hostile powers Putin s Russia, Erdogan s Turkey, Sisi s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can t ù Here again, the billionaire investor is guilty of peddling a convenient inversion of the truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr Soros, also happens to be a member It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: Russia s surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr Soros is right to point out that if the European Union carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement That is why the European Union needs to be radically reinvented ù The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self evident detriment of millions of working people It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short term investment as and where the opportunity arises It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08 The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti politics or to be more specific anti politics as usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward

"8 Apr, 2017",George Soros and Viktor Orb√°n go to war in Budapest,"Hungary s pressure on George Soros Budapest university is about more than the future of one school It s part of an ideological battle which will dominate European and North American discourse in the coming years Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Whatever you might say about Viktor Orban, he s a fast and decisive mover Last Sunday, when thousands demonstrated in Budapest against his proposal to tighten regulation on foreign universities, marchers spoke of a lengthy campaign of resistance Two days later, it was a done deal Orban had rushed the bill through parliament, displaying an efficiency Angela Merkel would admire, if she didn t distrust him for other reasons His target was Soros, Hungary s wealthiest son, who has become a hate figure for nationalists across Europe And a man who divides a country Many Hungarians admire Soros s philosophy and see him as a benefactor However, more again see his influence as nefarious and reject his ethos of globalist Atlanticism For liberals, Hungary has been a huge disappointment Because, back in the early 90 s, it was considered the most westernized of the ex Warsaw pact states And only 20 years ago, the Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats held an overwhelming majority in parliament Yet, with the country facing bankruptcy, they were forced †to implement a hugely unpopular austerity package that allowed Orban s Fidesz party to jump from 20 to 148 seats in the 1998 election For the next decade, the two blocs fought a close battle until the latter took control in 2010, with the Socialists mortally wounded by accusations of rampant corruption, which even led to riots Since then, Orban used his huge 2010 majority to change the constitution and has proven himself something of a chameleon For instance, he has simultaneously cultivated close relations with both Vladimir Putin and Poland s hyper patriotic government And although Russian companies have won significant contracts in the transportation and energy sectors, every time anti Moscow sanctions have come before the European Union, Budapest has faithfully backed them Inside the EU, Hungary s attitude to migrants has often created outrage For instance, when Angela Merkel was opening Germany s doors, Orban was constructing a wall to keep the newcomers out However, Fidesz, politically connected to Merkel s CDU movement through Brussels European People s Party grouping, has paradoxically proven to be its most loyal supporter in European parliament votes Fidesz MEPs vote 98 percent with us even more than the Germans, an EPP officialtoldPolitico this week †This displays the genius of Orban s double game Because while he s been busy dismantling liberal democracy in Hungary, EU grant aid has kept rolling in, averaging 2 4 percent of GDP from 2004 2014 And discontent in Brussels has been measured in murmurs, rather than roars Even the Americans seem relatively quiet, meekly observing this week how Washington is disappointed by the accelerated passage of legislation targeting (the) Central European University ùAt the same time, his government s overtures to Donald Trump, which it considers a like minded potential ally, have been met with silence While everybody knows that Orban s obvious desire is to clip Soros wings, the actual legislation itself is slightly more vague It forces foreign universities to close unless there s a bilateral agreement in place between Hungary and their home ùgovernment and they have a campus abroad In the case of the Central European University, the only option is to open a mothership in the US or head for the hills As a result, other locations, in Austria, Romania and Lithuania, have been offering themselves as alternatives The CEU was founded in 1991 in Prague, before former President Vaclav Klaus booted it out a few years later Back then its stated mission was to educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region ùBy the year 2000, it had moved onto a special emphasis on democracy promotion and human rights ùAmong its alumni are Azeri dissidents Ilgar Mammadov and †Rashadat Akhundov, Serbian pro NATO activist Srƒëan Cvijiƒá and current Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili Thus, many local influencers fear Budapest has been hosting its own colour revolution ùfactory Orban and Soros have had their share of mutual grievances Two years ago, the Prime Minister accused the billionaire of being responsible for the migrant crisis His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle, ùhe told a radio station These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros shot back, saying he was trying to uphold European values ùwhile Orban s actions undermined those values ù In February of this year, the feud intensified Large bodied predators are swimming here in the waters This is the trans border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery, ùOrbaninsisted It is causing trouble that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics, ù Orban s party is fully on board Fidesz deputy chairman, Szilard Nemeth,said †in December that Donald Trump s US election win was a game changer: these organisations must be pushed back with all available tools, and I think they must be swept out And now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election ù As for the two heavy hitters themselves, while both are Hungarian, they couldn t be more different Soros is a billionaire, whose $25 billion fortune is worth about 20 percent of his homeland s entire GDP He was raised in an upper middle class home in Budapest, his father a lawyer and his mother from a wealthy family of silk traders At the age of 17, he left Hungary and migrated to Britain, where he studied at London s School of Economics Ten years later, New York beckoned and, by his late 30s, Soros had founded his own fund management company By contrast, Orban is a country boy Hailing from the rural county of Fejer, where his father worked in agriculture, he studied law in Budapest However, such was his dislike for city life that, upon graduation, he immediately relocated to a country town, Szolnok, and commuted into the capital for work In 1989, he spent a few months at Oxford University, ironically on a Soros scholarship, but quickly returned to Hungary to enter politics Soros once said he hoped that his foundation would help Hungary become a country from which I wouldn t want to emigrate ùIt seems, at the age of 86, his mission to fashion his homeland s politics to his own agenda has failed That said, the majority of Hungarian voters appear to be supportive of Orban s ambition to create an illiberal, nationalist state, within the European Union And there s no doubting how the politician is winning the argument ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/384038-george-soros-viktor-orban-hungary/

WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social Democratic Party no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social Democratic Party ss: Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse ss: Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War ss: Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President ss: Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest ss: Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality ss: Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population ss: Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours ss: Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment ss: There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President ss: While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe ss: Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all ss: One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems ss: Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/

MM:Yes, obviously she is also out of touch You know what is surprising?

We see by the way the same judicial activism in Europe with the Syrian visa in Belgium at the court of justice would like to have issued The will of the people should prevail It is not for the judges to rule, but the politicians ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/376942-europe-migration-poll-chatham/

Donald Trump unleashed a furious storm on his newly inaugurated presidential head when he decided to put ink to paper and sign off on what the world refers to as the infamous Muslim ban ùAnd just like that, America and most of the Western world flocked to the defense of Muslims, arguing Washington s vile immigration policy and fascist streak!

What it is that is so very evil and antithetical to American values, and sense of decency?

The Oval Office did not manifest the list of countries; it recycled the intelligence that Obama s administration put forth and then pulled a Trump on America I find the sudden cries of outrage both hypocritical and ever so conveniently timely From where I m sitting the US did not exactly wait for Mr Trump s arrival to revel in all things Islamophobic And yet today a litany of Hollywood stars and other celebs ùare having a day at the bashing their favorite tangerine pantomime to a nasty pulp @Nigel_Farage&@KTHopkinsvoice their support for@realDonaldTrump s#MuslimBanand want the same for Britain https: // tdotco /ehKJyNUSKt I would personally argue that the United States has not only defined but architected the very industry that is Islamophobia, to the tune of misconceptions, bigoted generalizations, and downright fascist orientalism Here I would say that Mr Trump stands the product of decades of exceptionalism, political arrogance, and intolerant self entitlement Let us remember for a second that President Trump sits in the White House not as conquering sociopath, but an elected official In all fairness, every decision he has so far taken good or bad, has been in keeping with his campaign promises Might it be the Mexican wall, the anti lobby act, or theMuslim ban, Mr Trump has been consistent As his daughter once declared: He says what he means, and he means what he says ù So what gives?

"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety , limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps: // tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory

I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https: // tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The Open Society Institute (OSI) and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the European Union, going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt ‚Äì Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough The nation s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign backed NGOs operating in the country The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it s great to have you here on our program, welcome Peter Szijjart√≥:My pleasure, thank you ss: So, we ll start with the latest: † Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros † I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that How dangerous are those organisations for your country? ps: Actually, there s a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country which is a very dangerous approach, because it s not true There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would ve run, so there were no people voting for I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me People vote on politicians, on political parties So it s the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous number one Number two, you know, there s a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it s not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent So, that s why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments then it should be known to the people ss: Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with local groups despite government s opposition ps: What we say is that they have to be transparent People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics then these people have to know, whom these are representing That s what we want to know ss: Well, who are they? ps: We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary He has a very clear, let s say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn t like our approach, doesn t like our policies But, it s not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it s the Hungarian people We find it very anti democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for ss: But when George Soros says that more than ever he s going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he s going to go against the government s will How s that going to play out? ps: He has a very clear intention, that s definitely true, but I think it s an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence This is what we have heard a lot from the U S , for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country So, it s a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors people, persons, businessmen of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves ss: If you re saying you re going after NGOs, you can t just go after Soros funded NGOs, you ll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well Are you ready to do that? ps: My position is that we have to ensure level playing field So, double standards we don t like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by Actually, it s I wouldn t say funny because it s too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter N is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family so, actually, I don t think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non governmental organisation is too much ss: So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country s foreign policy? ps: I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life social, political life of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are ss: But here s a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros funded NGOs, before they came to power so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? ps: Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad in the U S and in the UK But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things ss: Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe do you think with him in the office it s going to be easier for Hungary to get rid of these Soros foundation NGOs in your country? ps: What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points There were very clear attempts from the U S to interfere in our internal issues Just to give you an example, I was given a two page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S as a foreign minister This two pager contained some measures which the U S government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship but, come on! I mean, it s too much, it s interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary Although our economic and defence military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve ss: We re going to talk about U S Hungary relationship in just a bit Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? ps: What I understand from my colleagues, since I don t supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations ss: What s the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? ps: Since I m not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard ss: I spoke to Ex president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus † and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe Why are they still so supportive of this open door policy? What do you think? ps: I wouldn t speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015 I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there s no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there s war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia So, why the EU carries out this open door policy? You should ask the high ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy It s harming the EU, it s dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU we don t even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not † but if you speak like this, you re going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that migration equals terrorism , which you ve never said But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe ss: I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter argument for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested if I m correct a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren t refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it s a homegrown thing ps: It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there s a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are with opening green borders to them, saying please come on in , without controlling them does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been double societies or parallel societies constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies We have to speak about this openly We think that this solution based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it s totally against common sense We have to be able to protect ourselves We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that ss: So let s talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey Luxembourg s Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that Aren t you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? ps: No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary we are a Schengen member state, so if there s a decision that a number of ex migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country number one Number two it s against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they re going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx And, number three, it s breaking European regulations These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling ss: Just because this open door policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr Orban, comes out and says bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide I m thinking, maybe, it s a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a national suicide ? ps: There are tricks in that First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don t oblige So, † these are tricks, and it s very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don t want it ss: You ve turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren t the only one there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls Is this the only way, to put up fences? ps: We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there s a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders according to regulation But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you re located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours it even said, during opening hours ! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia so no Schengen member states There s no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations! then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly So, it s tragic, I ll say ss: Are you pro Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? ps: We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it s a suicide for the European economy European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting sequence and adjusting type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone That s what we have been working on, and that s why we don t like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you re accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming ss: You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe s security, especially Germany is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? ps: Very minimum The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it s not true, because we have border crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country † of course, respecting the regulations When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower Only three countries ss: Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really goes against all European , but he s still willing to take the risk How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? ps: There s a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately Because of European regulations † you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our † perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal ss: I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington do you think Orban s friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary s relations with the EU? ps: I don t think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he s the President of the U S , and I see that there s a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it s not them, it s not liberal Western media, it s not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who s going to be the President of the U S I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him as such a progressive, such a † wonderful, such a smart guy !, but because it s Donald Trump, now he s bashed in every sentence, which I don t think would be fair and correct Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it s American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar † to his position ss: And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti establishment forces, may not win this elections do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? ps: There s a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it s no wonder these are challenging times There s a kind of fight or debate between two camps sovereignists and federalists We say we belong to the sovereignists, of course that European Union can only be strong if the member states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union The only question is how to get there? Our position is that only strong member states can lead to a strong European Union ss: My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy they don t want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S , these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe ps: We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn t want to break the European unity but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well ss: Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview Good luck with everything ps: Thank you RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/
"25 Jan, 2017",RT critics admit promotion of Russian media threat is a money racket,"Regular readers of RT Editorial will know this column has provided evidence of how think tanks, which are increasingly indivisible from lobby groups, faithfully promote the specific agendas of their paymasters regardless of their stated high minded missions When it comes to Russia, most of these faux academic concerns have primarily concerned themselves with whipping up hysteria about a supposed imminent military danger to Eastern Europe Shocker: almost all of them arefundedby weapon manufacturers and entities like the US Department of Defense In other words, the very people who need a bogeyman to justify heightened armed forces spending However, convincing the general public that Moscow is going to overrun Europe has always been a hard sell Mainly because Russia is not the USSR and its military spending is much smaller compared to NATO For example, the Kremlin s 2017defense budgetis around $45 billion This compares to the $622 billion Washington hasprojectedfor the coming year That does not include all the other NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, which recentlysigneda $125 billion contract with General Atomics, just for the supply of drones Probably aware they needed a new schtick, in recent years, bodies like The Atlantic Council and the Center For European Policy Analysis have expanded messaging about the supposed Russian threat to the long reigning mainstream media consensus RT is, of course, the favorite target and scary monster As a result, we see a kind of schizophrenic discourse where the network oscillates from being a huge danger to something nobody watches (but still is a cause for a cash call), depending on which agenda they are pushing on a given day With this in mind, it was interesting to note Monday s Guardianpiece, headlined EU escalates its campaign against Russian propaganda, ù for two reasons Firstly, because the newspaper apparently couldn t think of an example of Russian propaganda ùin an article about Russian propaganda ùand instead used a story promoted by an American website, to illustrate the purported Russian threat: In recent weeks the unit (Stratcom East, an EU outfit dedicated to watching Russian news services) has been correcting a widely shared and entirely false story that claimed that a 1,000 strong mob chanting Allahu Akbar ù burned down Germany s oldest church, ùthey wrote This storyappearedon Breitbart, which is based in Los Angeles and is 100 percent American owned Then they followed up, with EU officials estimate that Russia spends $1bn ( 801m) on state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik ùQuite why the EU needs to guess is beyond rational understanding, given how RT is transparent about its financing, which amounts to around $300 million this year, or less than a third of that appraisal Not just that, but all media funding by the Russian state is widely publicized every year, and even adding up the RT and Sputnik budgets still amount to much less than half of the reported figure So much for the MSM s war on fake news ù Just as the EU increased the strength of its Stratcom East ù annex from eleven staff to 19, and lobbed another 800,000 in its direction (because nearly $800 million for BBG and 289 million supplementary Defense & Security funding for BBC World Service clearly weren t enough, not to mention the financial support for the likes of DW, France24, and Euronews to continue fighting the good fight), came a most enlightening conversation between a group of media experts, specializing in the post Soviet space The event washostedby n ost, a German advocacy group, funded by Washington s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which has earned a bit of a reputation forpromoting regime change ùin countries independent of US foreign policy The chat concerned whether articles about Russian propaganda now are more widely read than Russian propaganda itself ùRight now, you can take Russian propaganda ùto mean anything which offers an alternative view to the mainstream media consensus At the roundtable were an interesting bunch of folk Alexey Kovalev, formerly of RIA Novosti, was joined by Vladimir Soloviev of Moldova s Newsmaker, which gets its cash from the European Endowment For Democracy (the EU s version of NED) and Gemma P√∂rzgen, a board member of Reporters Without Borders, a concern funded by George Soros, NED and the EU Commission As they spoke, our heroes seemed to realize how ridiculous the whole hysteria against Russian media has become P√∂rzgen admitted that in the case of Germany, for example, I think the problem is grossly exaggerated Some so called experts have blown it up out of all proportion There s a lack of proper research on the subject that could provide an objective view There s a lot of propaganda around propaganda if you see what I mean ùMeanwhile, Kovalev conceded that (in Russia) state TV channel budgets, both domestic and international, are being cut, projects are being wound down and so on ù It was toward the end of the discussion when things got fascinating when in this warm, relaxed echo chamber atmosphere the brave info warriors let it slip that their entire mission is essentially a money racket Take Kovalev: the battle with Russian propaganda ù has already turned into a fully fledged industry in which many people, including myself, have had successful careers It would be stupid to give them up because of the negligibility of our field of study That s one reason ù Soloviev: I also see it as an industry, with budgets that need to be spent In Moldova, the subject is a best seller on the internal political market In 2015 the current Mayor of Chisinau (and deputy chair of the right wing Liberal Party) won his third election thanks to the fact that he spent most of his election campaign fighting Russian tanks But there s nothing new about the city looking like the site of some kind of urban warfare ù P√∂rzgen: You re right there, Alexey There are so many people in the market who used to cover security issues and have now lost their jobs But now they ve seen the chance to get back into business There are also lobbying groups such as the Atlantic Council, who have started running conferences all over Europe on the same subject: The rising influence of Russian propaganda ù And with that, you could have dropped the metaphorical mic Because the same people who benefit, via funding for their projects, from stoking the fears of Russian domination of the information space, are acknowledging that it s fundamentally a gravy train All aboard! ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375009-rt-critics-russian-media-money/

according to Reuters citing a local official Despite the announcement of a peace accord, the unrest continued in Bouake, with the defense minister trapped in the city, according to Reuters Mutinying soldiers also opened fire on a local official s house, Reuters reported citing a witness The soldiers had first forced their way into the Bouake military headquarters with demands just after midnight on Friday They then moved to take two smaller cities Daloa and Korogho The cities of Odienne and Daoukro were also hit by the mutiny, but according to a televised statement by Cote d Ivoire s defense minister, the situation has since been brought under control Fighting is reportedly still ongoing in Bouake, a city of half a million, and center of a rebellion that took control of the country in 2002, until a 2011 uprising reunited the northern and southern parts Most of those involved in the uprising appear to be former rebels The shooting is very heavy right now at the 3rd Battalion I m nearby and I hear it like it was right next to us, ùKonan Benoit, a resident, told Reuters by phone several hours before reports of gunfire in Abidjan The agency says gunfire could be heard in the

allegedly demanding five million CFA francs ($8,000) each, as well as a new house Earlier on Friday, the defense minister said the government was prepared to discuss the demands, after it was suggested that the army send in troops into Bouake The reasons for the latest spate of violence in Bouake on Saturday morning were unclear, but a member of the uprising told Reuters the soldiers had seen what they thought was suspicious movement in the night This is gunfire to discourage them, ùhe added We are going to talk with our men, listen to their preoccupations and find solutions to this situation, ùDonwahi said earlier in a statement He added that the rebellion was understandable but deplorable for the image of the country and for the work the president has done since the end of the

surveilling the situation, and an agency journalist said they saw 20 UN military vehicles about nine miles out of Bouake, driving in its direction This is not the first time a rebellion of this sort has taken place In 2014, a similar uprising over back pay resulted in the government agreeing to settle with the soldiers It is thought the soldiers were emboldened by this But according to organizations and government sources on the ground, a different settlement to the conflict appears tricky at this point, in part due to infighting within the military itself, as well as parallel chains of command A local diplomat in the Bouake region told Reuters the government could only hope to contain the revolt by force if it sent in the Republican Guard or special forces But the Republican Guard protects the president, and the special forces there simply aren t enough of them, ùthey added One soldier told the BBC that the government had not made good on its earlier promises from 2014, which supposedly triggered the current revolt However, it is not seen as anything more than a pay dispute this time around instead of a real cause for concern The soldiers loyalty is

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia If there were a hero of the year list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian led airstrikes One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself a decision that also took out the approaching enemy John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko s single act of heroism when he wrote: I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism –£ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥ –ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–æ–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å –Ω–∞ —Å–µ —è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞https: // tdotco /vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that NATO does not seek confrontation, and that it is everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race, the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever closer to Russia s borders However, as Pepe Escobarexplained, The real measure ù is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018 This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s Putin emphasized that NATO s inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to respond adequately to any threat to its national interests On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, Jamala (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision s rules Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors: The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!, Clark concluded via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is, In God We Trust Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as The Satanic Temple (TST) Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics, Thranholm wrote TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000 One of the group s objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan ù Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ù,according to a promotional video Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from God Country : Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US led countries continued with their regime change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from † war torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe s welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants, that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros plan will reap positive benefits via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the forced migration caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it: If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states, Gerrans concluded The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber if not outright disastrous outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance Following news that Germany s Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded: Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign No more In a highly controversial move, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19 year old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony Let s deal with some facts here, Cunningham continued Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years So much then for claims of Russian state sponsored doping ù Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance enhancing drug only in January of this year In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances The US anti doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add insult to injury As Bryan MacDonaldexplained: Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency The reader will be able to discern the line of reasoning in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone: Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes ù In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov s murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs, Whitmore tells us So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime It could also turn out to be a harbinger ù As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump s landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back door machinations Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania The idea didn t seem so wild at the time for a Clinton coup as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306 232), he failed to win the popular vote reportedly by 2 5 million votes Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton in similar fashion to George W Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court could steal the White House from Trump This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes, Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle of so called faithless electors tipping this contest in Clinton s favor Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton an unlikely yet possible scenario Trump went on to formally secure the vote and the presidency on December 19 via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor: Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence ù that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved ù in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta ù against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still ongoing hacking operations from the air Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace Happy New Year!

"19 Dec, 2016",POTUS-picking: Electoral College under intense focus in controversial election year,"The 538 select Americans that will gather at state capitols across the US on Monday, who are expected to officially pick Donald Trump as the 45th US president, are now facing calls by Trump s opponents to disregard the election results The arcane and often ceremonial institution has received more attention than usual in this controversial presidential election year, when every election process from closed primaries to recounts has received extra scrutiny The electors are nominated by the political parties in each state and in Washington, DC Each presidential candidate has their own unique set of potential electors in each of the states When Americans voted on November 8, they weren t directly voting for the candidates whose names appeared on the ballot, but rather for an elector to go to the Electoral College on December 19 and vote for their candidate Currently, 306 electors are pledged to vote for Republican President elect Donald Trump and 232 are pledged to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Voting is conducted between 9am and 3pm, with the vote expected to be called shortly before 6 pm There has been much discussion over whether Electoral College members could decline to vote, vote for another candidate, or switch party allegiance after Donald Trump, a Republican candidate who was critically denounced by leading members of his own party throughout the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious There was also the suggestion that Hillary Clinton s remarkable lead of 2 8 million in the popular vote might affect the outcome of the Electoral College vote If Electoral College votes against Trump, US will get worst constitutional crisis in its history (Op Edge)https: // tdotco /zXrUFFDmD9pic twitter com/Dg2x7cKlPf There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote according to the results in their states

president and vice president appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party which nominated the elector constitutes a resignation from the office of elector, his vote shall not be recorded and the remaining electors shall forthwith fill the vacancy, ùthe Michigan law reads Apart from the state laws, Democrats and others hoping to encourage Republican dissenters to switch their vote or decline to vote have been intensely focused on the Electoral College voters Here are the top three: In a video lasting just two minutes and 23 seconds, a roster of Hollywood actors that includes Martin Sheen, who played a president in the popular TV series West Wing, ùappealed to Republican Electoral College members, asking 37 of them not to vote for President elect Donald Trump Thirty seven is the new magic number, as if 37 of Trump s 306 electors do not vote for him, he would have only 269 electoral votes one short of a majority If that happens, and it is a long shot, and neither Trump nor Clinton receives a majority of the electoral votes then the House of Representatives would decide who becomes president Unite for America, which sponsored the video, appears to be a new Super PAC

may be as many as 20 members who are least considering not voting for Trump The one member who has gone public is Christopher Suprun of Texas, who has said that, since his announcement, he has

Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv You don t need to worship at the altar of George Orwell to see where this is going Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as fake news on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it s proposed to implement it merits many questions Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country s popular press But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg s firm is an effective monopoly CIA meddled in hundreds of

the sheer number of competitors in every national market And the more different they were, the better for society in general However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary Of course, another big problem here is that one person s fake news ùcould be another s truth And that s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self proclaimed international fact checking network, ùwhich presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing They include Pierre Omidyar,George Sorosand Washington s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft power cutout As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine s Maidan coup in 2014 Thus, it s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of ministry of truth ùwith only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook s primary news feeds And this is very dangerous Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact checkers to sort out fake news https: // tdotco /jZmZXrpl06pic twitter com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling Because it s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices That said, nobody is disputing whether fake news ùis a problem It s just hard to find agreement on its definition For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it s often a different story Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked bynumerouscrediblesources And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging thatVladimir Putinwas using kompromat ùto destroy the reputations of his political opponents For proof they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography German politicians want 500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrshttps: // tdotco /VSGNiA2M98pic twitter

the K G B and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride ùAnd to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes Yet, sadly for Higgins and Bukovsky, of course his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child pornimageshimself, as research Then there s theGuardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune without any explanation suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the sameWashington Post These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source And we can t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of alove childand Moscow developing a Star Trek esqueteleportation device Are all these not examples of fake news? ùBut given that they are establishment names in the western press, don t expect Poynter to

opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko The Ukrainian leader s public approval ratings have

Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections, ù Shlyamin believes He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko s leadership, with his promises to introduce visa free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption

"9 Nov, 2016",Blame Bernie,"The decision by Sanders to throw his support behind the Clinton campaign after he lost the nomination for the Democratic Party candidate may have deprived a third party candidate of the chance to defeat Donald Trump If anything, the 2016 race for the White House has only confirmed that what passes for democracy in the United States is in serious crisis, reflective of a political system that is rotten to the core Donald Trump, confounding all the polls and liberal media by winning the presidential election, has become in essence CEO of an empire which in the early 21st century is no longer sustainable The ever deepening social and economicinjusticethat passes for normality in the US is the foundation upon which the American empire rests, which in concrete terms functions on the back of wars of aggression, proxy wars, and regime change This social and economic injustice at home and projection of imperialism overseas exist in a circular relationship most simply and profoundly explained by Malcolm X in the 1960s when he remarked, You can t understand what s going on in Mississippi if you don t understand what s going on in the Congo ù People are dying or getting sicker because they can t afford their insulin, just so Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk can make outrageous profits pic twitter com/5bpwnR2jJ2 And it is precisely here where the mass movement that Bernie Sandersinspiredoffered so much potential to transform the lives of the millions of ordinary Americans of all races, ethnicity, and religion who have been progressively crushed under the weight of the corporate juggernaut that is the real power in the country In this respect, the decision by Sanders to fold his tent andswing in behindthe Clinton campaign after he lost the nomination for Democratic Party candidate under decidedlydubiouscircumstances was as inexplicable as it was disdainful Moreover, how can it be justified when he spent the primaries attacking Hillary Clinton s integrity, record and credibility so passionately and effectively that she was left floundering to stem the rising tide of support his campaign was attracting?

And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq which was half a million dead Iraqi children was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded, We think the price is worth it Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball: Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government But it is already clear that Russia s intervention in our election on Trump s side is the real scandal of 2016 Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia s (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the real scandal of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange s torturous, slow drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind boggling list of poor decision making The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics, Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans nothing to look at here, please move on Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton s chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump s victory chances on Nov 8th And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC †chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton Trump CNN hosted debate The jaw dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate style investigation By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either But that s mere child s play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad Clinton s leaky emails point to the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of †ISIS †of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including †ISIS, that s there in those emails, the WikiLeaks co founder said There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone, he added Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of collateral damage in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We ll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers ù Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich as opposed to Russia was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr Rich ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered îat dawn îas he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild conspiracy theories, yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about Russian involvement in the WikiLeaks Although it may be perfectly true that Mr Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government îthe Russians When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America s global military footprint if elected president, neo conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American style fascism Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election What is the source for this great defection against their own party?

It s possible because Hillary Clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole US establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon War Party/Wall Street/corporate media axis But History has a tendency to show us there s always a straw that breaks the camel s back This could be it asrevealed by WikiLeaks; March 2, 2015, the day when †John Podesta wrote, we are going to have to dump all those emails ù BREAKING: WikiLeaks releases 26th batch of#PodestaEmailsfrom Clinton campaign chairhttps: // tdotco /3EXeP1ejJa That happened to be the exact same day it wasrevealedHillary Clinton had used a personal †email server as Secretary of State Yet this reveals only part of the puzzle There s got to be a response to Podesta s email which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then we ve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative according to which Hillary just deleted personal emails crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards Moreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept and FBI investigations As far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis DCLeaks com, for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors ) Assange sorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https: // tdotco /6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to evil ùRussian hacking when the real source for the leaks might havecome straight fromthe belly of the (Washington) beast At the Valdai discussion club last week, ittook President Putinonly a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang: Another mythical and †imaginary problem is what I †can only call the †hysteria the †USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in †the †American presidential election The †United States has plenty of †genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the †colossal public debt to †the †increase in †firearms violence and †cases of †arbitrary action by †the †police You would think that the †election debates would concentrate on †these and †other unresolved problems, but the †elite has nothing with which to †reassure society, it seems, and †therefore attempt to †distract public attention by †pointing instead to †supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of †influence and †so forth Hillary Rodham#Clintoncampaign blames Russian hackers as Julian#Assangepromises more leakshttps: // tdotco /rdfAB0F0XZ I †have to †ask myself and †ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the †American people s choice?

Syriahttps: // tdotco /uKTfWXWOLn Among the anti Russia lobby were US based and George Soros funded Human Rights Watch Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia The campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain also a member of the council convened a summit in Geneva The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces Russia s permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkinrebukedthe UNHRC for a one sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and France, along with Gulf Arab states, which lobbied

funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011 They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country in the name of fighting terrorism ù which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes In recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties So, of course, Western orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality The contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug abuse charges, or the pseudo probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligenceagenciesthat

/sqWeSwjg48#UNHR#SaudiArabia#humanrights The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia Perhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats That Saudi Arabia widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil rich ally gain a seat,according todocuments released last year by WikiLeaks A Saudi led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen It is also welldocumentedthat US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes That makes these Western states fully complicit Moscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F 16s bombing of Syrian civilianshttps: // tdotco /WzwvworaZdpic twitter com/cHlKvzaeUD Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years,according toa report last week Britain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, hassoldover $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015 Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots tohelp trainSaudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law There is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC The hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void Importantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti Russia claims as fabrications The information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British located so called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by activist ùgroups within terrorist held east

into#Aleppo war crimes https: // tdotco /xrdojTxO3vpic twitter com/2gKhTiMovH In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called Free Syria ùbroadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi owned satellite platform ArabSat Free Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks Free Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans Another regular contributor to the images and reports ùon this Saudi funded, terrorist supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center Thus, on this publicly available Free Syria ùchannel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self incriminating amalgam What is even more damning is that the same information ùis disseminated albeit in a more polished form through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian It s an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted Russia s military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies And to add insult to injury, these terrorist sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies The utter insanity of it all But maybe the Western lynch mob will

"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European 'forced migration',"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called colorrevolution s, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps: // tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the Open Society Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety , we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/
"24 Aug, 2016","Modern Ukraine is 25 yrs old, but is it actually independent?","Ukraine celebrates the 25th anniversary of its succession from the Soviet Union this week But, after years of struggle and division is it truly independent? Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv March 2014 was arguably the most dramatic and pivotal month in Kiev since Ukraine seceded from the USSR The country s democratically elected government had been overthrown in a violent coup (considered to be a revolution in the West) and the new regime was struggling for legitimacy Especially after a leaked phone callbetweenthe US Ambassador Geoff Pyatt, and State Department representative Victoria Nuland, seemed to suggest external actors had dictated its make up Adding to the tumult, Crimea had just voted to separate and re unite with Russia in a hastily organized referendum, (which is regarded as an annexation by much of the West) and Donbass witnessed clashes between pro Maidan protestors and others who opposed the movement At this moment, Ukraine was on fire and needed all the support it could muster Except that backing never came, despite gaggles of Western politicians showing up in Kiev in early 2014 pledging solidarity with activists who sought to remove President Yanukovich Two and a half years later, Ukraine has received minimal aid from Western countries and is no closer to EU membership than it was then In fact, even the promised visa free travel arrangement with Schengen countries has yet to materialize Sharp analysts have long suggested that Western power brokers aren t that dedicated to helping Ukraine Instead, the argument goes, the priority seems to be hurting Russia This week, via a DC Leaks dump of billionaire Hungarian investor George Soros communications; we havenew evidenceto support that argument What s also interesting is that when Russia ejected Soros NGOs, Western reaction was apoplectic DC Leaks revelationssuggestPresident Putin s move to block these groups might have been soundstrategy On the last day of March in 2014, according to the files, Ambassador Pyatt sat down for breakfast with billionaire Soros and a group of lobbyists he employs to push his agenda inEastern Europe What is most startling about the conversation is the total lack of regard for Ukrainian interests and the obsessive focus on Russia It s also instructive as to how Western influencers regard Ukraine More as a buffer against Moscow than as a country with rightful aspirations of its own At one stage Pyatt asks Soros, what (the) USG (US government) should be doing and what the USG is currently doing (sic)? ùThe reply is Obama has been too soft on Putin, ùand he goes on to suggest a division of labor between the US and the EU with the US playing the bad cop role ùin dealing with the Kremlin It s all Putin, Putin, Putin and continues in this vein The only mention of Ukraine is when Pyatt and Soros agree to remove Yulia Timoshenko from the equation Timoshenko is associated with everything undignified, ùthe ambassador states Now, we are all entitled to an opinion on Timoshenko But her political party Fatherland is currently themost popularin Ukraine and it s up to Ukrainians to decide whether she is fit for office, not a bunch of foreigners who have no democratic mandate in the country After all, Ukraine is supposed to be a sovereign state But a quarter of a century after modern Ukraine was established, how independent is it really? If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro western reformers ùand pro Russian kleptocrats ùThis is hogwash The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov) What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power And for the past two years, they ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory Something even America s influential Foreign Policy journal nowadmits There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West Furthermore, he s enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal That said, Poroshenko is described as pro Europe and his predecessor as pro Russia However, in reality, both men are pro themselves and pro money Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems The central Asians with the exception of Kazakhstan have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago Let s just look at Ukraine s figures In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller in real terms than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now To add insult to injury, it is also the world s mostunequal country When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet s most extensive rail systems A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world s largest plane, the An 225 This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now With that in mind, you d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of Marshall Plan to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming Because they know the funds would be stolen Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States ùThus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine s economic collapse is the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor ù In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal, ùPetro recently wrote However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev You see, Ukraine doesn t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia Except it s not Slovakia s gas, because that country doesn t have any of its own Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium Ukraine s completely insane economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs pic twitter com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn t want to admit that it s Russian gas This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an independence day ùmilitary parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all Aside from all this, what Poroshenko s regime can t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is Currently, it s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world If Back to the Future s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again, how many would jump right in?

Green, independents, and other third parties ù @RyJamesG@DanRiehldon t worry George Soros is probably already directing his army of lawyers to file suits to get him on state ballots Numerous states have laws in place which favor Democrats and Republicans such as Pennsylvania where, based on a 1971 statute, candidates must collect between 20,000 and 70,000 signatures to gain access to the ballot, compared to just 2,000 needed for Democrats and Republicans Similarly, Florida requires an independent presidential candidate to have 110,000 signatures by early July to ensure they re on the ballot for the November election FairVotenotes that Texas has some of toughest laws against third parties, where independents must gather signatures equal to 1 percent of the turnout in the previous presidential contest Voting restrictions disenfranchise people of color, the poor, young people & the disabled These laws are modern day poll taxes #VRAChat Not only are superlawyers ùsuch as Elias not working to change these undemocratic ùrequirements, but the party has actively opposed those candidates for years Following their loss ùin the 2000 campaign, the Democratic Party lodged 29 complaints in 19 states against Green Party nominee Ralph Nader during the 2004 campaign, all aiming to have him removed from the ballot In Pennsylvania, it was successfully argued in court that more than 30,000 signatures on his nomination papers should be scrapped on such technicalities as using a nickname such as Bill instead of the formal name William, accordingto Oliver Hall, Nader s attorney In July, a federal court ruled that the number of signatures needed by third party candidates to make it onto the ballot in the Keystone State be reduced from 21,000 to 5,000, which the Libertarians, Greens and Constitution Party were able toachieve Smaller parties can also get stuck with expensive legal bills if challenges against them are successful, such as the case with Nader in 2004 who had to pay off almost $82,000 without the help of billionaire donors such as Soros Nader thus became the first candidate in American history to be penalized financially by a state for attempting to run for public office, ùHall says A similar fate befell the Pennsylvania Green Party in 2006 when Carl Romanelli ran for the US Senate Needing 67,000 signatures, he gathered more than 100,000, only to be successfully challenged and left with an $89,000 legal bill It s a frustrating process repeated almost every election cycle, since parties often need to achieve a certain percentage of the vote to remain on the ballot for the next time, something the Green Party has shadowing over them inTexas Ballot access isn t the only barrier preventing independents and third party candidates from making an impact in the presidential election Most states distribute their electoral votes on a winner take all basis, making it nearly impossible for smaller parties to garner support when the major two have

Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy eyed patriot boasts In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was Lock her up! Lock her up! ùwith all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house Trump promises to Make America Great Again, ùa sufficiently open ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean Given the billionaire s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and isless than enthusiastic about NATO This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, thegloatingover the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America s way be described as progressive Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have someinteresting friends and supporters Wall Street and George Soros prime among them who aren t exactly struggling to get by Then, too, the sympathy she s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill s notoriouscrime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end It is a two term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years?

Jerome White:She has a long record, as did her husband Bill Clinton with very, very close connections to the most powerful financial institutions in the US on Wall Street Under her husband s administration they deregulated Wall Street; they lifted the Glass Steagall Act, and allowed the immense building up of the financial bubble that produced the financial collapse of 2008 As the Obama administration carried out the bailout of Wall Street, the Clintons maintained very, very close ties As we all know, she received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fact millions of dollars and speaking fees in the aftermath of the crash RT:Clinton is also likely to get more contributions now that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have dropped out of the race Will this have an impact on her stances on issues and, perhaps, presidency? JW:After an entire primary process in which for the first the anger of millions of workers over the social inequality, over the domination of the entire political system by the financial elites was expressed In the end essentially, what the American people have is a choice between two equally right wing candidates, two pro war candidates On the one hand, a billionaire, who is Donald Trump, who seeks to tap into the social anxiety and channel it along xenophobic and anti immigrant lines; on the other, complete tool of Wall Street and of the Pentagon In the end, the [Bernie] Sanders campaign, which tapped into this enormous anger he is now committed to support Hillary Clinton, who he openly criticizes as a tool of Wall Street But he as a Democrat now is supporting that very same tool of Wall Street RT:The fact she is supported by big corporations doesn t seem to be harming Clinton s ratings Don t people care about this? JW:You have two of the most hated politicians in the US who are going to be facing off one another in the elections The fact is that there is deep hatred for Clinton and for Trump But we live in America, in an entirely bought and paid for political system that excludes any genuine opposition I am running as the Socialist Equality Party s candidate for president in the US and the ballot access laws are thoroughly undemocratic So, as I said, the population the working class is confronted with two equally right wing warmongering shields of big business RT:Do you have any idea why Clinton makes statements about the Wall Street threat while she receives huge contributions from America s big bankers? JW:The Democratic Party has long played the role of claiming to be the spokesman of the oppressed, of working people But it is the second party of finance capital In this case it is now the primary party of finance capital So certainly Clinton is going to, as Obama did, present themselves [sic] as being sympathetic to the victims of Wall Street But in fact if you look at the Obama administration over the last eight years, the greatest transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top has occurred in US history Whatever the phony rhetoric about Wall Street none of the criminals from 2008 crash have ever been held accountable The reports today are that the hedge fund owners have made massive increases even if the industry itself had problems last year, one of the hedge fund recipients, or owners, Ray Dalio made $1 5 billion last year George Soros, major funder for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, made $700 million last year alone You have an oligarchy in the US in which is financial elite, which is totally unaccountable, can carry out crimes, dictates policy, dictates domestic policy That is why they claim as no money for pensions, schools, or decent wages Yet they can expand trillion of dollars on bailing out the banks and trillions more for war against Russia, or China, or in the Middle East; wars that defend the same financial aristocracy as the war against the working class in the US ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/342630-trump-clinton-wall-street-war/

So really what this is, in my opinion, it s social engineering This is social chaos instituted by the likes of billionaires like George Soros And again this is anti Donald Trump We saw the same thing with the violence and a rally having to be cancelled at the University of Illinois and Chicago not too long ago So, we need to ask that question first: who is behind this?

So the people on the ground and I noticed that one of your reporters had also been arrested they are right when it comes to that And the American people should be angered, but we should be shining a giant spotlight on the real criminals people like Hillary Clinton, people like Barack Obama these are the enemies RT:The Occupy movement still exists, although it s not as big as it once was Will Democracy Spring take further hold? CG:I think so We ve known that this was going to be coming for months now It is not a surprise I ve been following the story It is interesting to note that CNN barely has a headline on this right now So, thank you RT for actually shedding light on this But also it is interesting if we just look at the semantics calling it Democracy Spring Of course, anyone enlightened knows that CIA here in the US, the US and our allies organized and engineered covertly and was a large part of what we saw with the Arab Spring protests not long ago, toppling governments in countries like Egypt with revolution The ouster and indirect murder of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi all of that engineered by the West, the US Again, not that there s organic qualities and not that these leaders like Muammar Gaddafi weren t despots or horrible dictatorial figures, but we know who is really behind this Just like we see a Democracy Spring movement here in the US today, which is backed by George Soros ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/339442-democracy-spring-george-soros/

like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash Here s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super rich as elite friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005 Last October,

Sorosian liberals who no doubt gloated over Monday s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes

Trump on Putin s compliment: Great honor https: // tdotco /WPsiSWKYQApic twitter com/2WmfxnGvsn Last week, for example, demonstrations in Chicago organized by the Soros funded MoveOn org group forced Trump to cancel a speaking engagement Later, on March 20, members of the same subversive outfitblocked trafficnear a Trump event in Arizona, while police in New York City the same day pepper sprayed demonstrators, some of whom are affiliated with violent anarchist groups And then there s the corporate owned media, which, instead of impartially and dispassionately reporting on Trump s rising star, is working on behalf of its owners to knock it out of the sky Here is a random CNN smearpiece, which opens with the angst ridden line: Anti Trump Republicans desperate to stop the billionaire from being their nominee are discussing creative ways to halt his momentum ùSo the story now is not about the millions of Americans who support Trump s political ideas, nor even discussing what those ideas might be, but rather about how the racist, misogynist, sexist outsider must be stopped Consider these two competing lines from another CNNarticle, and how they work to manipulate the mind of the reader regarding the boastful ùTrump and the proud ùClinton: Trump repeatedly boasts about the failure of millions of dollars in attack aids to wound his campaign, and insists he is on pace to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination ù While the very next about Clinton reads: Clinton said she was very proud to have won Arizona and hit Republican candidates who she said were literally inciting bigotry and violence ù But it is not just the Democrats and the liberal media working to sabotage Trump s campaign Incredibly, even the Republican Party is plotting against their own frontrunner, as Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox Newsexplained But why would the GOP work against Trump if he represents the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? #HillaryClintonspeaks at#AIPAC2016conference [VIDEO]https: // tdotco /X1yGaBHOvM Pirro nails it with this answer to herself: The Republican establishment are in bed with the Democrats So if Hillary wins, nothing is lost for them It s business as usual The lobbyists keep their offices on K Street, the pharmaceutical companies keep paying them and the lawmakers get their re election bribes I mean, contributions ù Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, when asked to explain the elite s refusal to support Trump, perhaps gave away a bit too much information when hesaid: Well, because he s an outsider, he s not them, he s not part of the club, he s uncontrollable, he hasn t been through the initiation rites, he didn t belong to the secret society ù Initiation rites? Secret societies? Secret handshakes? Did Newt just join ranks with the conspiracy theorists? Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers One of his regular claims aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him Although it is a delicious sight watching America s movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold hearted wretchedness of the dual party, borderline fascist system Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks The Establishment would continue unmolested with its too big to jail banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power Trump s ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they d work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril This polarizing issue largely explains Trump s huge popularity among voters today The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump s political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it Amazing comments from the Pope considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank you very much Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff raff According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US Mexican border But the crazy is just beginning Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing Only the government could script such a narrative But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, ùsaid Garza This right here is border insecurity at its best Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities ù If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right wing parties, I really can t imagine it And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political correct speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from No, sending a message to other would be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W Bush s reckless 8 year war on terror Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it He never explained that decision to the public ù A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be All Americans knew is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job ù Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non consequential 8 year intermission by America s first black president) Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree) I think this is a  great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, ùshe told C Span early last year I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that ù But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America s former shine @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/

"5 Mar, 2016","I'm confused, can anyone help me? Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I m confused Very confused Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately weaponizing the migration/refugee crisis to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia s intervention in Syria on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011 Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011 so surely it s more accurate to accuse them of weaponising the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government We want people to come back to Syria, hesaidin February Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back, he said, asreportedby Telesur And this is the man who along with Putin we are told is deliberately weaponising migration by the NATO commander? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused very confused in fact by the portrayal of Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton as a progressive who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be the lesser of two evils Now, from what I ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and regime changer whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton s foreign policy record in this 2015article Among Hillary s boasts are that she urged her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia The innocent civilians killed in the illegal humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton urged included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces Four years later, Hillary sided with hard right Republican Party hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS You don t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny We came We saw He died! Last week on George Galloway s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party s Dr Jill Stein told us Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support How does Clinton s record make her progressive ? Or has the word progressive today been redefined to mean an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge fund billionaire GeorgeSoros I m confused Can anyone help me? The EU referendum Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo But I m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for Brexit in June s Referendum We retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for national security and in order todealwith Russian aggression Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support @DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic twitter com/evltbtGyuo We re told a Brexit would shock the world economy And the UK itself wouldbreak up But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn t in the EEC/EU And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of 550m As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: The public finances were also in rude health a borrowing requirement of 1 96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of 600m by the end of 1969 And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969 Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre EEC accession era, but the UK wasn t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv) So our national security clearly didn t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it s a different world today But Norway and Switzerland aren t in the EU and didn t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people Leading bankers City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders Tony Blair They can t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m confused still confused about the ongoing investigation into the MH 17 plane disaster After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong evidence that the plane was shot down by a surface to air missile We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft, said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014 But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators Now if it was so clear cut that rebels supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused about what we ve been told by western political figures about Russia s intervention in Syria When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and moderate Syria opposition forces You have a strong propaganda message that says you re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it,‚ÄùUK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a warning shot for Russia But if Russia hadn t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we ve seen renewed allegations that Russia isn t hitting IS But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January: It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary This is no longer the case How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS s air force Surely IS would be advancing if Russia s campaign was really aiding the group? I m confused Can anyone help me? Finally I m confused about Turkey and British support for democratic values British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a long standing goal for Britain His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an important ally Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan s government is steamrolling over human rights,‚Äùsays Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid: The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated Impunity for human rights abuses persisted The independence of the judiciary was further eroded Now, neocons always tell us that they re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond?

"26 Feb, 2016","Pentagon update: US, not Russia, responsible for breaking Islamic State","The Pentagon has a lot of money to spend on propaganda But its white washing Russia out of progress in Syria has an increasingly propaganda savvy audience howling, and is a poor use of resources This week, the Pentagon information machine made some pronouncements which saw the light of day in media outlets which includedAOLand theDaily Mail In materially identical pieces, US Army propagandist Colonel Steve Warren fires off several rounds of bullet points to the effect that Islamic State is beginning to crack ùunder the onslaught of air strikes and counter terror measures ù, and that would be jihadis are realising that this caliphate isn t all unicorns and rainbows whatever that means His main bombardment consists of the notion that we have the US to thank for this progress He says: We see them having lost about 40% of the territory that they held at the pinnacle of their strength in Iraq, and they have lost about 10% of the territory they once held in Syria We believe this failure is due to several factors, the first and foremost I believe is the presence of devastating Coalition air power Second is the increasing capability of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq And third is the increasing cohesion, strength and unity of the 65 nation coalition that has come together to defeat Daesh ù The problem with the colonel s presentation from a propaganda point of view is that it is not very good It is too blunt People are more sophisticated than this even people who spend a lot of time on the Daily Mail website Whether you like Putin or not, his decisiveness in Syria was a game changer After years of pretending to chase ISIS, the US was suddenly shown to have been merely simulating activity for entirely different ends Russia, on the other hand, went in to clean house and has worked effectively with the army of Syria to that end Any grown up apportioning of credit which leaves out the key players discredits itself before it begins It s like trying to discuss Gone with the Wind without reference to either Scarlett or Rhett Yet this is Colonel Warren s approach He simply disregards everything which doesn t suit him: the fact that the US led coalition ùhas no legal mandate in Syria; that Assad is the democratically elected head of that country; that the US is engaged in destroying arbitrarily and unilaterally (in fact, if not in name) yet another foreign state which has done it no harm; that finally and emphatically if the resolve of this group of US sponsored terrorists is beginning to crack ù, it is thanks entirely to the efforts of the Syrian Army and the air support provided by the only outside country to have a legitimate role in Syria: Russia #ISISeasy to defeat if#Turkeyand#SaudiArabiadid not support it Assad s adviser to RThttps: // tdotco /JY5GJCdSCZpic twitter com/ND8VdtlBrO The colonel has a tough job on his hands Too many people now understand that what is needed for the defeat of so called Islamic State, is for the US government to cease providing it with arms and funding They know that this chameleon like organization only makes any sense when seen as an arm of US Israeli policy; to Balkanise the Middle East and make it easier to control, and to facilitate the theft of their wealth by corporations; its secondary purpose in combination with the efforts of men likeGeorge Soros is to create the blowback needed to justify an invasion of Europe by an army of aggressive, unskilled young men in order to asset strip it, drag it into chaos, and prevent what the US fears most: a new union built around afreer Germany co joined with Russia Agents of US military ambitions such as the CIA have always created media outlets or subverted existing ones as part of propaganda wars against foreign countries But two thorns appeared in the side of this policy in recent years Firstly, in a world connected by the internet, propaganda intended for foreign consumption routinely feeds back into the US arena, thereby falling foul of laws against the use of US tax dollars to conduct informational war against the taxpayers themselves Secondly, again in a world connected by the internet, US citizens are increasingly discovering uncomfortable truths about everything from 9/11 to banking and medical cartels Thus, distrust of government internally is a growing problem for those tasked with managing the population As ForeignPolicy comnotes, the philosophical foundation for the policy of not using US tax dollars to propagandize US citizens was to maintain a distinction between the US and the Soviet Union Happily for those burdened by such concerns, the Soviet Union is no more, and in 2013 the US removed the last fig leaf of pretense that the US government did not engage in propaganda internally This makes everything simpler The war propaganda machine can lump the US citizenry together with everyone else and get on with the job of bringing or keeping everyone on board with whatever the Pentagon s masters wish it to do In a war scenario and the US is almost always making war on someone budgets extend and keep themilitary industrial complexmaking more for its shareholders The guiding principle of those who get the government contracts which collectively make wars happen is to ensure that the last penny gets spent so that the same amount or preferably more will be forthcoming in the next financial period The US military, then, is a huge state run business in the form of a bureaucratic and accounting machine tasked with blowing things up as a function of securing funding It manages to kill a lot of people, but it is a blunt if heavy instrument It was described to me by a friend then himself serving in US Army Intelligence as the Post Office with bombs ù Like any large organization it works on a system of protocols There will be a manual somewhere which tells you what a nail is, what a hammer is, and how the two are to be used together Then in the context of the US military there will be a Halliburton contract for huge numbers of hammers and nails, and a general somewhere with shares in Halliburton who will find a use for both In the view of military planners, then, propaganda is just another hammer Recent figures are conspicuously hard to find, but Fox Newsreportedback in 2009 that the Pentagon was spending $4 7 billion annually on what it calls the human terrain of world public opinion, employing an army of 27,000 whose sole mission was the promotion of US military objectives via media What the numbers are today, we can only guess But it won t be less because it never is Planners of military propaganda will allocate their budgets the same as any public relations company That is, they will focus on predetermined demographics and opinion leaders endlessly testing and measuring to see what is working, what not and using the data thus generated to provide the engine for new, expensive proposals to the client The delivery method or tactic to use public relations speak which Colonel Warren employed this week has become almost hackneyed through over use It is to claim the narrative as fully owned; to assume the conclusions one wishes to see as given; to deny the existence of either the legitimate claims or participation of any party or view but those which suit one s agenda While many consumers of propaganda may not understand this model intellectually, increasing numbers recognize it viscerally They have an intuitive appreciation of the genre, having been exposed to it many thousands of times The state of Israel uses it to exclude the Palestinians from any debate about their own land; corporations use it to achieve and maintain monopolies; governments use it to keep people paying income tax Subconsciously, the model is associated with various forms of oppression and tyranny This hammer and nail school of propaganda has its roots in a vertical and uniform, pre internet informational model The model today is broad and disparate; people can shop for opinions The colonel s activities this week will have helped eat some small part of the budget, but I would argue that this particular assault was a bad use of resources It is too on the nose It looks too much like what it is: a hammer And as people rumble the type of tactic employed above by the Pentagon, they tend to regard the source thereafter as unreliable on point of principle not a good outcome if your goal is to cultivate the human terrain of world public opinion to your advantage @SamGerrans LISTEN MORE: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333700-pentagon-propaganda-us-russia/
"16 Feb, 2016",Soros (seriously) underestimates his audience by blaming Putin for EU refugee crisis,"George Soros, the billionaire investor whose own native country of Hungary accused him of betraying Europe ù by supporting refugees escaping war torn regions of the Middle East has turned around and blamed Vladimir Putin for the humanitarian crisis Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In anopinion piecereleased last week, Soros seeks to prove that President Putin was working to foster the EU s disintegration ùby flooding the continent with refugees, allegedly as a result of the Russian military s foray into Syria where it has dealt a lethal blow to Islamic State forces George Soros is no fool, of course He will go down in the history books as the man who broke the Bank of England ù an achievement that, while conspicuously lacking a moral chromosome and ethical outlook, took no small amount of mental finesse to pull off And that s why Soros s anti Putin rant is so strange: it is so illogical and blatantly wrong headed to the point where a sense of desperation oozes between the lines Soros s argument comes down to this: Putin s decision to launch a military offensive in Syria was not to halt the encroachment of Islamic State, the most despicable gang of terrorist thugs to step foot on the world stage, but primarily as a means of dividing Europe ù And I quote: An EU that is coming apart at the seams will not be able to maintain the sanctions it imposed on Russia following its incursion into Ukraine, ùhe wrote On the contrary, Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti European parties that he has carefully cultivated ù Unsurprisingly, this line of rubbish failed to hoodwink the overwhelming majority of readers which Soros apparently believes are too ignorant to connect the dots between Syria, Russia and Europe Indeed, it was sheer entertainment perusing the Guardian sreader commentsection following the article, which proves Soros seriously underestimates his audience s grasp of geopolitical issues My personal favorite anti Soros jibe came courtesy of Peter Whitelaw, who wrote: We ve been bombing the Middle East off and on for the past 30 years †Russia does it for two months and they are the biggest threat ever †If we re not bombing Middle Eastern countries then we re selling arms to them so they can do the bombing instead of us ù To that succinct comment I would add the question: If Soros really thinks it such a horrible thing that refugees from the Middle East and beyond are storming the gates of Europe, why has he been advocating on behalf of just such a scenario for many years now? In October, †Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, whose country finally halted the flow of refugees by installing a razor tipped fence along the length of its southern border,called out Sorosby name when he said the schemes of well organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation states and leader who have never been elected ùcould come to fruition Europe has been betrayed, ùOrban continued If we don t stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here ù Orban s public chastisement of Soros behavior is not without foundation One month before the Hungarian leader voiced his concerns, Soros had published yet another opinionmasterpiece, this one entitled, Rebuilding the Asylum System ù In it, he expressed bewilderment that each †member state [of the EU] has selfishly focused on its own interests ùto the point where the asylum seekers have been the main victims ù(Incidentally, I ve yet to hear Soros come out and defend the hundreds of German women †who were sexuallyassaultedby refugee men during the course of New Year s Eve celebrations) With an arrogance that almost defies belief, Soros goes on to argue as if the European people have absolutely no say in the matter whatsoever that since the origin of the current crisis is Syria, the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority ùtherefore the European Union has an obligation to distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states ù Blood and Tears: Chaotic scenes at Hungarian border as#refugeescome under tear gashttps: // tdotco /TXvLxfdfoDpic twitter com/mgBnHDKXwD This breathtaking comment is followed by a 6 point plan †for the EU to follow It should suffice for our purpose to just quote Soros first point, which alone probably launched 1,000 right wing parties in Europe: The EU has to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually for the foreseeable future and †provide 15,000 ($16,800) per asylum seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs ù As my colleague Lionel would say, let that comment marinate for a moment: The EU has to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually for the foreseeable future? Really? Now take a second and perform a simple reality check and ask, Which individual is really seeking the disintegration of Europe: George Soros, with his Open invitation to every asylum seeker in the Middle East and beyond (it has already been exposed in the German media that the majority of asylum seekers entering Europe do not come from Syria, but are predominantly from other countries that were previously torn asunder by US backed military offensives/adventures, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) or Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was formally invited by Damascus to initiate a military offensive against ISIS forces, which up to that point had not been noticeably weakened despite Western claims that it was fighting the terrorist organization? Furthermore, what would Russia stand to gain by flooding the European continent of which it is a geographical part of with desperate asylum seekers, many of whom may actually be card carrying members of lethal terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and Islamic State? Finally, Russia s economy would hardly recover anytime soon if Europe its largest trading partner is somehow reduced to violence, sectarian strife and chaos as Soros somehow asserts Given Soros powerful influence and clout among some European bureaucrats, it seems his outrageous anti Russia position has gained some traction among some predictable circles This is especially the case with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is desperately in need of a scapegoat for the refugee crisis as far right nationalist groups, likePegida, are enjoying a groundswell of public enthusiasm not just in Germany but also across Europe Exactly one day before Soros anti Putin piece hit the newsstands, Merkel was paying a visit to Turkey, of all places, where she Well, let s just let George Soros explain what she was doing there: Angela †Merkel flew to Ankara on February 9 to make last minute arrangements with the Turkish government to induce the refugees already in Turkey to prolong their stay there She offered to airlift 200,000 300,000 Syrian refugees annually directly to Europe on the condition that Turkey prevent them from going to Greece and will accept them back if they do so ù Yes! With a wave of Merkel s magic wand, no more unsightly photo opportunities from nosy journalists featuring throngs of unwashed hordes storming the EU gates Why, that would have derailed George Soros oops, I mean Vladimir Putin s plan to overrun Europe with a future low wage labor pool and a divide and conquer carnival Just what Europe needs as their venal leaders in reality, nothing more than mindless technocrats enforce harsh austerity measures on young and old alike Merkel just cut through all the unsightly mess and awarded the refugees frequent flier mileage points right smack into the heart of Europe where they will be paid 15,000 ($16,800) each †if Soros gets his way courtesy of European taxpayers that is, those who are still employed and can pay taxes Meanwhile, last but not least, Soros rarely spouts venom at Turkey, Saudi Arabia and all of the other usual suspects who are in some way complicit in the extremely curious rise of Islamic State, a group of savages, we are led to believe, that possessed enough business savvy to become the owners and operators of a lucrative oil business, exporting vast amounts of Syria s finest right past the Turkish border and into European gas tanks Nor did Soros have any harsh words of condemnation for Turkish President Erdogan, who extended his thanks to Russia for cleaning up Syria s terrorist infestation problem by shooting a Russian fighter jet out of a clear blue sky in November, thereby ratcheting up tensions in the Syrian theater to unprecedented levels Unfortunately, individuals like George Soros, who certainly have the funds and the brains to make a positive difference in places like Europe and Syria, have chosen instead to spread vicious anti Russia propaganda so thin and conspicuous it actually flies back and damages their own misguided cause, as opposed to the purposeful actions of their purported enemies @Robert_Bridge This article first appeared in a slightly altered form inRethinking Russia The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332655-soros-says-putin-blame-syria/

 Ukrainian people sold their country for a song, let s rewind to
 November 2013, when then President Viktor Yanukovich had shocked
 western capitals and, more importantly, western markets by
 suspending plans for an association agreement with the European
 Union Video:
 /files/opinionpost/37/c1/b0/00/2530092_obana_new mp4 As if on command, thousands of Ukrainians suddenly poured into
 the streets of Kiev to protest the decision Such a rapid
 reaction should not have come as a surprise After all, a
 multitude of US government agencies most notably, USAID had
 been operating in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
 investing billions on its latest democratic pet
 project This is no conspiracy theory On December 13, 2013, Assistant
 Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, following her third trip to
 Ukraine in five weeks, told the National Press Club: Since
 Ukraine s independence in 1991 the United States has invested
 over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in needs and other goals Exactly what those other goals may have been, and who
 helped underwrite them, seem rather obvious today Although many are tempted to believe otherwise, governments don t
 normally spend such prodigious sums of money in a foreign land
 unless it expects to get something hefty in this case, Kiev s
 loyalty in return Governments are by nature political
 opportunists, not philanthropists, which is precisely why Russia
 gave USAID the boot in 2012 Ukraine did not, and was forced to
 pay the piper, so to speak We should note here that it was not just US taxpayer dollars that
 unwittingly provided the funds to support the coup d etat in
 Ukraine In another softball interview with CNN s Zakaria,
 billionaireGeorge Soroslast May coolly admitted: I
 set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent
 of Russia And the foundation has been functioning ever since and
 played an important part in events now ù Certainly those billions of dollars weren t spent just on
 humanitarian work, like distributing pastries to the Ukrainian
 rabble gathered on Independence Square After all, the crucial
 question as to who would lend Ukraine a multi billion dollar
 rescue package was the elephant parked on Maidan that few talked
 about Once upon a time, western financial institutions had the
 market cornered on the lucrative task of bailing out
 cash strapped countries Today, however, other economic agencies
 BRICS for example are able to compete with the IMF But after
 Kiev exploded in chaos and violence, the regular lender of last
 resort bagged itself another national trophy for above its
 fireplace Michael Hudson, of Counterpunch,summed upthe IMF victory: In April
 2014, fresh from riots in Maidan Square and the February 22 coup,
 and less than a month before the May 2 massacre in Odessa, the
 IMF approved a $17 billion loan program to Ukraine s junta 
 Normal IMF practice is to lend only up to twice a country s quote
 in one year This was eight times as high Hudson said the loan,
 given at a time of civil war, proved that the Washington based
 financial institution functions as an arm of US Cold War
 politics Kiev used the loan for military expenses to attack the
 Eastern provinces, and the loan terms imposed the usual budget
 austerity, as if this would stabilize the country s
 finances For anybody who still believes those billions of dollars were
 spent just to prop up democratic institutions need only consider
 the harsh historical lessons from places as diverse and distant
 as South America and the Middle East Time and again, from Chile
 to Iran, Washington propped up puppet dictatorships to serve its
 purpose Proving this charge is as simple as eavesdropping on a telephone
 call conversation between Nuland and the US Ambassador to
 Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt Almost one year ago to the day, Nuland was heard outlining
 Washington s vision of Kiev s future democratic structure Nothing terribly ironic about that, right? While much
 of the amused media focused its attention on Nuland s F*ck
 the EU ùverbal bomb, that was mere child s play compared to
 the meat of the conversation, which spelled out exactly who
 Washington wanted in power in Kiev Nuland: I don t think Klitsch
 [Vitaly Klitschko, one of the opposition leaders] should go into
 the government I don t think it s necessary, I don t think it s
 a good idea Pyatt:Yeah I guess in terms of
 him not going into the government, just let him stay out and do
 his political homework and stuff Nuland:I think Yats
 [Arseniy Yatseniuk, current prime minister of
 Ukraine]is the
 guy who s got the economic experience, the governing experience 
 He s the what he needs is Klitsch and Tyagnibok [Oleg
 Tyagnibok, the other opposition leader] on the outside He needs
 to be talking to them four times a week, you know I just think
 Klitsch going in he s going to be at that level working for
 Yatseniuk, it s just not going to work Pyatt:Yeah, no, I think that s
 right OK Good Do you want us to set up a call with him as the
 next step? Or, instead of enduring the obscenities of a Nuland conversation,
 one could simply wait for Barack Obama to sum it all up in an
 interview with CNN all star softball pitcher Fareed Zakaria Instead of challenging Obama on the question as to whether
 US NATO policies in Eastern Europe which, aside from moving
 inexorably eastward to Russia s border, also excludes Russian
 participation in the US missile defense shield have in some
 substantial way contributed to the deterioration of relations
 between Russia and the US, Zakaria merely dangles the Russian aggressor ùcarrot before Obama, who of course
 blames the entire mess on Putin, while admitting to something
 incredible, yet entirely believable READ MORE: US envoy to Ukraine caught posting
 fake images on Twitter Obama told CNN s Zakaria that Washington had brokered a deal

 everything we needed to know about Ukraine s so called democratic
 transition, it s a completely different thing when the deal ùis admitted to by none other than the American
 president Washington power brokers, desensitized to the concept of
 brokering political deals ùdue to their so called
 democratic work in faraway war zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
 Libya, think it normal operating procedure to employ the strategy
 inside of sovereign states that are experiencing internal
 discord The real tragedy of such a scenario is not so much that it is
 happening, but that the United States, and the Ukrainian people,
 it seems, believe that a foreign invasion of political
 opportunists on their territory constitutes democracy or will
 somehow lead to democracy I d wager to bet that Ukraine will
 very soon resemble Greece, where the people had firsthand
 experience with foreign enforced austerity measures and,
 employing real democratic procedure as opposed to backroom
 brokered deals, introduced real democracy to elect politicians of
 the people, for the people and by the people But then again, the United States expected no less from the $5
 billion, and a few cakes, it paid for Kiev s pledge of
 allegiance Now the Ukrainian people must dutifully follow that

 highest soft power quotients around the world, Brazil remains
 submerged by clich√©s Vibrant democracy ùcertainly lived up to its billing in
 this hard fought presidential election Yet another clich√© would
 rule this was the victory of state centric ùpolicies
 against structural reforms ùOr the victory of high social spending ùagainst a pro business ù approach
 which implies business as the privileged enemy of social
 equality Exit clich√©s Enter a cherished national motto: Brazil is
 not for beginners Indeed Brazil s complexities boggle the mind It starts with
 arguably the key, multi layered message a divided country sent to
 winner Dilma Rousseff We are part of a growing middle class We
 are proud to be part of an increasingly less unequal nation But
 we want social services to keep improving We want more
 investment in education We want inflation under control (at the
 moment, it s not) We support a very serious anti corruption
 drive (here s where Dilma s Brazil meets Xi Jinping s China) And
 we want to keep improving on the economic success of the past
 decade Rousseff seems to get the message The question is how she will
 be able to deliver in a continental sized nation suffering from
 appalling education standards, with Brazilian manufacturing
 largely uncompetitive in global markets, and with corruption run
 amok Brazil is now mired in dismal GDP growth of 0 3 percent Just
 blaming the global crisis doesn t cut it; South American
 neighbors Peru at 3 6 percent, and Colombia with 4 8 percent are
 definitely going places in 2014 And yet the numbers are not that shabby Job creation is up 
 Unemployment is down to only 5 4 percent Investment in social
 infrastructure is picking up From 2002 to 2014, the minimum wage
 more than tripled GDP per capita is up, reaching roughly $9,000
 while the 2012 Gini coefficient of social inequality is down Industrial production is back to the same level before the 2008
 financial crisis Brazil paid all its debts to the IMF The
 proportion of debt in relation to GDP is falling reaching only
 33 8 percent in 2013 Workers have more purchasing power and
 even with rising inflation, that mirrors better income
 distribution Social programs have benefited 14 million families roughly 50
 million Brazilians These policies may arguably be derided as too
 little, too late Keynesianism But at least that s a start in a
 nation exploited by immensely ignorant, arrogant and rapacious
 elites for centuries Rousseff s first stint as President may also be blamed for too
 many concessions to big extremely profitable banks in Brazil,
 powerful agribusiness interests and Big Capital What happened,
 in a nutshell, is that the center left Workers Party swung to
 the center and was compelled to make unsavory oligarchic
 alliances The result is that a significant section of its social
 base the metropolitan working class, now heavily indebted to
 sustain its brand new consumer dream ended up flirting with the
 right as a political alternative Add to it the PT s not exactly brilliant management skills True,
 the fight against poverty is a lofty ideal But in such an
 unequal nation, that will take at least until 2030 for really
 serious results Meanwhile, serious planning is in order such
 as building a high speed railway between the two megalopolises,
 Rio and Sao Paulo (the Chinese would do it in a few months) And
 seriously tackling Brazil s oligopolies; banks, corporate media,
 construction/real estate conglomerates, the auto industry lobby Unlike the US and Europe, neoliberalism in Brazil has been
 repeatedly knocked out at the ballot box since 2002, when Lula
 was first elected President As for the social
 democrat ùopposition, there s nothing social, and barely
 democratic, about it The PSDB s pet project is
 turbo neoliberalism, pure and simple Team Neves had everything going for them Their key constituency
 was in fact 60 million mostly angry Brazilian taxpayers over 80
 percent living and working in the wealthier southeastern
 seaboard Life is tough if you are a Brazilian salaried
 professional or the owner of a small and medium enterprise (SME) 
 The tax burden is on a par with the industrialized world but
 you get virtually nothing in return No wonder these irate taxpayers are desperate for decently paved
 roads, urban security, better public hospitals, a public school
 system they can send their children to, and less red tape and
 bureaucracy which add to the nefarious, universally known Brazilian cost ù(as in no value for money) These are
 not Workers Party voters although some of them were What they
 want is galaxies beyond the everyday tribulations of the new,
 large lower middle class created by the social programs first
 implemented by Lula Yet with a mediocre candidate like Neves he even lost in his
 home state, where he was governor neoliberalism does not need
 enemies Neves predictably billed himself as the dragon who would slay
 what Wall Street derides as statism ù cutting
 government spending and liberalizing ùtrade, code for
 privileging corporate US interests At the same time Neves has
 never been able to capture the vote of an overburdened black
 woman in the favelas With Neves, Brazil s future Finance Minister would have been
 Arminio Fraga, a slick operator who, among other things, ran
 high risk funds in emerging markets for George Soros and is also
 a former president of Brazil s Central Bank Some of his
 shenanigans are detailed in More Money than God: Hedge Funds and
 the Making of a New Elite, by Sebastian Mallaby Fraga would have
 been the point man of a Soros inspired government Fraga is the proverbial Wall Street predator With him at the
 Finance Ministry, think J P Morgan controlling Brazil s
 macroeconomic policy The road in fact was already paved by
 PSDB s eminence, former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
 met with key global investors via J P Morgan in New York
 last month Fraga was keen on destroying the Lula and Rousseff
 administrations hyper Keynesian bet on demand ùand
 replace it with supply, via a new capitalist shock ùPredictably, his prescription was amplified by the enormous echo
 chamber of conservative Brazilian media, and drowned everything
 else And as perception is reality, contamination ensued pressuring
 public spending downwards, installing major confusion among
 private investors, and leading Western credit rating agencies to
 confirm the supposed lack of credibility of the Brazilian
 economy Brazil is slowly but surely moving from the semi periphery to
 being closer to the center of the action in international
 relations; because of its own regional geopolitical relevance and
 mostly because of its leading role among the BRICS This is
 happening even as Washington could not give a damn about Brazil 
 or Latin America for that matter US think tank land, ùby the way, abhors BRICS Politically, a victory for the Cardoso/Neves neoliberals a
 ghost of the social democracy they once practiced would have
 thrown Brazilian foreign policy upside down; not only against the
 way the historical winds are blowing, but also against Brazil s
 own national interests As Rousseff argued at the UN last month, Brazil is trying to
 fight a global crisis marked by increasing inequality without
 provoking unemployment and without sacrificing workers jobs and
 salaries As ace economist Theotonio dosSantosstressed, the decadence of the West
 still exerting substantial influence over the Global South via
 their extensive network of collaborators, he also went one up;
 the key fight, as he sees it, is to control Brazilian oil Dos Santos is referring to Brazil s top corporation, Petrobras,
 currently mired in a bribery scandal which must be fully
 investigated that obscures the Holy Grail: the future revenues
 from pre salt ùoil named after the billions of
 barrels of oil capped by a thick layer of salt lying several
 miles below the South Atlantic floor Petrobras plans to invest
 $221 billion up to 2018 to unlock this treasure and expects to
 make a profit even if oil trades around $45 to $50 a barrel Politically, in a nutshell, Rousseff s narrow victory is crucial
 for the future of a progressive, integrated South America It
 will reinvigorate Mercosur the common market of the South as
 well as Unasur the union of South American nations This goes
 way beyond free trade; it s about close regional integration, in
 parallel to close Eurasia integration And starting in 2015, Brazil may be on the road to renewed

"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta s desperate quest for legitimacy Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military final solution for the east In 2001, the Austrian
 economist Hans Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled Democracy:
 The God that Failed , in which he among other things 
 compared the process of voting to a religious ritual Just as the
 ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
 ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
 kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity In his
 study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
 monarchies actually safeguarded peoples lives and liberty far
 more than democracy has before making a case for outright
 anarchy Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
 democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
 home Western leaders routinely speak of democracy as a
 virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as rooted in the sanctity of the individual ù(BH Obama in
 Talinn, September 2014) In actuality, democracy is simply a
 decision making process in which the majority gets its way The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they liberate , however, democracy means whatever the
 liberators say it means Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
 independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not democratic 
 because the High Priesthood in the West says so while the
 violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was midwifed ùby Washington (per V Nuland s famous phone
 call) Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
 junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
 against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem Its prime
 minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
 Americans ( Yats is our guy, ùto quote Nuland again) 
 Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
 presidential vote in May By the time it was held, Donetsk and
 Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
 their separation Even so, the junta s Western backers proclaimed
 Petro Poroshenko elected on May 25 as the legitimate leader
 of Ukraine Quite unlike the aggressor and invader ù it was
 accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
 Poroshenko launched an all out war against the two eastern
 regions That war was lost Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
 lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
 battalions such as Azov have terrorized any civilians
 they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
 have failed Hence all the crying about Russian
 invasion to the Western press, but also the coming general
 election That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
 sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
 they are democratic , and thus worth backing More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
 nine months, this weekend s vote will showcase the absurdity of democracy as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic 
 What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
 procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
 up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
 acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
 between the Nationalist Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
 boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko And with
 every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis 
 not the neo variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind 
 that triangle keeps getting smaller Recent polls by the Western funded Democratic Initiatives
 Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post suggest a significant
 lead for President Poroshenko s party, followed by Lyashko s
 Radicals and Yatsenyuk s People s Front Meanwhile, the
 formerly ruling Party of Regions and the Communists 
 intimidated, brutalized and all but banned are polling in
 single digits However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
 they were undecided ù, which suggests they are either
 afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven t yet decided on the
 lesser of evils Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
 under Kiev s control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
 their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
 Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open
 for business But the liberators themselves won t get
 to vote; for whatever reason, the junta s legislature failed to
 pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front Meanwhile, the civilsociety organizations funded for
 years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy
 lists OPORA as one of its aid recipients in 2009) to create
 fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
 violations of campaign rules Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
 already reported over 527 violations, including at least 80
 cases of alleged voter bribery ùThey either haven t got the
 memo about how this election should be a showcase of democratic 
 Ukraine versus the authoritarian Russia, or they did
 get the memo, and are significantly under reporting voter
 intimidation and manipulation For their part, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics are refusing to
 go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
 November 7 They may not have a chance to hold them There isn t
 much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
 artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by A
 renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
 idea, but the junta s generals have certainly demonstrated
 greater stupidity over the course of the campaign When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several
 Serb majority areas refused to accept Zagreb s rule The Croatian
 government, backed by Germany, initially failed to conquer these
 areas, and accepted a UN guaranteed armistice (Vance Plan) Four
 years later, backed by the US, Zagreb launched an all out assault
 and reintegrated the territories by force, expelling
 some 200,000 Serbs that lived there Poroshenko s adviser Yury
 Lutsenko openly stated back in September that Kiev ought to
 follow Croatia s example in regard to the Donbass The democratic West said nothing After all, what
 Croatia did was a democracy too Because in the eyes of Western
 governments, the word means whatever they say it means, nothing
 more and nothing less To borrow from Lewis Carrol s description

"16 Sep, 2014","‚ÄòCarl Bildt - slavish supporter of US, not European values‚Äô","Sweden s Foreign Minister Carl Bildt whether it is for personal self benefit or because of general ideology 100 percent supports American policies almost without question, journalist Bryan MacDonald told RT Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv The Parliamentaryelectionsin Sweden, which took place on
 September 14, signaled the return of a left leaning government
 after eight years in opposition The change of government in
 Sweden also means an end of the mandate of one of the well known
 lawmakers in the European political arena Foreign Minister Carl
 Bildt Bildt has been a fierce critic of Russia over its politics
 in Ukraine RT:Bildt was one of the people behind the
 Eastern partnership the initiative governing the EU s relations
 with post soviet states Some argue, this policy is partly to
 blame for the current chaos in Ukraine, would you agree? Bryan MacDonald:It definitely played a large
 part, but it wouldn t exclusively have led to this of course 
 There are other factors such as Ukrainian internal politics,
 movements and of course interference of the US, NATO and
 non government bodies such as George Soros and Pierre Omidyar 
 But certainly the Eastern Partnership is one of the bulwarks, and
 of course Carl Bildt was one of the main supporters of it A
 partnership that has completely transformed the EU from a core
 group of 15 relatively rich West European countries to a group of
 27 where most of the group are poor RT:He served on the Board of Directors of
 Lundin Oil, during the Civil war in Sudan The company was
 accused of providing resources to government forces that
 committed crimes against humanity How did that affect his
 reputation in Sweden? BM:I don t think people in Europe are really
 aware of that I think Bildt in Europe was mainly famous for his
 behavior in the Balkans and Ukraine this year, and his general
 support of what we call eurocratic ùpolitics, which is
 where the elite within Europe, every country almost, with a few
 exceptions of course, seem to care more about the European
 project then the actual people who live in Europe at the moment 
 That is one of the reasons he has been in the news here, I don t
 think Sudan is such a big issue in Europe itself amongst the
 normal voting public RT:Bildt worked with the Committee for the
 liberation of Iraq pushing for the invasion of the country How
 big of a role did the organization play in the conflict? BM:Again, like with the Ukraine situation, it s
 one of many groups that played a role in conflict Obviously the
 biggest role in the conflict was played by George Bush and Tony
 Blair by their bombing of Iraq Of course it played a role and
 Bildt is a notorious neo con, but the real question here is that
 Bildt is a slavish supporter of what we call American values
 which are not necessarily in train with what we call European
 values Most Europeans, not all, but especially countries like
 France, in the Nordic countries and Ireland, would be suspicious
 of America s actions and would have a very different world view
 to the US Bildt is not; Bildt is for whatever reason, maybe his
 personal self benefit or general ideology, 100 percent supports
 American policies without almost any question ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/188136-bildt-sweden-eastern-partnership/
"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to ‚Äòvoluntarily commit suicide‚Äô,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT s Truthseeker RT:Could you
 summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
 IMF loans, to Ukraine s best assets ending up in private Western
 hands the IMF s knee breaker role as you memorably described
 it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
 mind is that finance today is war by non military means The aim
 of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
 ending up with its property The main property to obtain is that
 which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange For
 Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
 companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
 oligarchs For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
 these assets and their revenue into foreign hands in an economy
 whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
 of the failed post 1991 restructuring That is where the IMF
 comes in The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
 deficits Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
 mainly to maintain a country s exchange rate The effect usually
 is to subsidize flight capital out of the country at a high
 exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
 dollars or euro In Ukraine s case, foreign creditors would
 include Gazprom, which already has been paid something The IMF
 transfers a credit to its Ukraine account, ùwhich then
 pays foreign creditors The money never really gets to Ukraine or
 to other IMF borrowers It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
 including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
 Greece Such loans come with conditionalities ùthat
 impose austerity This in turn drives the economy even further
 into debt forcing the government to tighten the budget even
 more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
 assets RT:Can Ukraine expect the so called IMF
 effect of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
 to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
 to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants 
 remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP (About $10 billion a
 year ) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
 Western Europe The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
 more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work They will send
 some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
 Ukrainian currency vis √† vis the ruble and euro RT:How are the IMF s tools in reality
 weapons of mass destruction ù as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
 austerity and unemployment The result is a downward economic
 spiral Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues So governments are
 told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets 
 mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
 extract economic rent The effect is to turn the economy into a
 renting tollbooth economy ùHitherto free public roads
 are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
 sewer systems also are privatized This raises the cost of
 living, and hence the cost of labor while overall wage levels
 are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
 raises unemployment RT:The IMF s perhaps also a weapon of mass
 destruction in a more literal sense The organization has
 publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
 re design its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
 Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting 
 Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
 instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF s conditionality ùis that
 it pacify ùthe East Pacification may occur violently
 in today s Orwellian rhetoric The only way in which actual
 political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
 federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
 kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
 the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
 prosecuted the IMF All that voters can do is reject governments
 submitting to IMF conditionalities Many voters who are able will vote with their feet ùand simply leave the sinking
 economy So the IMF s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
 are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered 
 Austerity is ultimately a policy nobody is holding gun to their
 head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
 in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it In this
 sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago RT:Everyone knows austerity s effects on
 Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don t want it;
 even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn t work Why will
 Ukraine s leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
 job in the West when they ve voted out or something? MH:Ukraine s leaders are mainly kleptocrats 
 Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
 their own power George Soros has written that their best way to
 do this is to find Western partners This will provide US and
 European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
 economy Western support will provide more IMF and European
 lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
 can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
 banks RT:Do you think that the EU isn t stupid
 enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one sided
 association agreement, member states will just strip the country
 of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
 Ukraine s 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
 member One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
 German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Ukraine has rich Western land,
 and that part of the country is largely still rural Foreign
 investors would like to buy it out and re feudalize ùit, creating large business farms But the EU is unlikely to
 provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
 investment in Western European agriculture The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
 benefit from its inexpensive labor Wrecking the economy
 Greek style or Irish style or Latvian style is sufficient to send
 its workers to the West And the most mobile traditionally are
 the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
 languages and with skills in demand in the West RT:You noted Ukraine must have asked the
 US first before blowing up that gas pipeline Do you think NATO
 will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
 less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
 waging a big PR campaign in Europe MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
 economy much more high cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
 in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange The NATO
 rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
 Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine won t continue
 subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
 Russia can arm itself against us [with this money] ù The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
 manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
 defend itself And without purchasing foreign technology and
 without large state subsidy as US and European governments
 provide their own economies Russia cannot create a
 manufacturing economy So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
 earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
 that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
 military power my potentially be used to achieve political
 independence from the US sphere RT:Anything else you would like to
 add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
 throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
 power of elected governments, and hence of democracy Governments
 are sovereign No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
 or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
 state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
 war At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
 financial oligarchy, or elected governments The two sets of aims
 are antithetical: rising living standards and national
 independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international
 dependency The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/170960-economy-imf-ukraine-oligarchs/
"26 May, 2014","‚ÄãChina to be the most important country in XXI century - Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment There s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today Follow@SophieCo_RT ss: Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us We re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? JR:Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don t like saying it, since I m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together America is driving Russia more and more to Asia That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington ss: So you re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? JR:Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly As you know, they ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn t think through the consequences Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that s not so unusual what s unusual is that America didn t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day to day basis, so now Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia I m afraid America just didn t think it through, they ve bungled, they ve acted on a day to day basis, and they ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr Obama ss: You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine another embarrassment for the US foreign policies ù Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? JR:That s an extremely good question Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia ss: But if you re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? JR:I didn t say it s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that s not that s good for Russia, that s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners ss: George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? JR:America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to I mean, if we ve sold all of our oil reserves, it s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even But, then the markets it s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn t have anything in reserve, so again, you have to ask him, I don t know, but that doesn t seem like a very viable solution to me ss: But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe will the US be able to fill the gap? JR:No America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe You don t just sort of snap your fingers and do that You don t just put in on a boat or plane, you ve got to have special ports on both sides, you ve got to have special ships, and you ve got to have natural gas in the right place Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe that s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas will they have a surplus in five years? I don t know Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it ss: I don t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? JR:Pay it back to the European Union? No, I doubt it very seriously They re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it I don t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back ss: Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair? I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? JR:Sophie, you re asking extremely good question I don t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play I don t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game I don t see what America expected to get out of it Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would ss: But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? JR:I don t see that it has hurt Russia Maybe there s something I don t know, but I don t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point ss: What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk So where does that leave dollar? JR:Again, I don t particularly like saying this, because I m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar many people now must be saying guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don t like us, they ve going to put sanctions on us! ùSo more and more people would say maybe I shouldn t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn t have my money in US dollars ùAt the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar More and more people are doing the same thing, they re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar This is just a continuing long term move away from the US dollar And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions ss: So, if you re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? JR:The US has been the world s reserve currency, has had the world s medium of exchange and so far we ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say here they are! ù then that cripples America in many many ways The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view Just recently, the space people said every country in the world has eventually collapsed ùand the way America is going, we might collapse too This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things If you read history, Sophie, it s true, it s correct When people do not have the money that they used to have they re limited in many ways You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don t have the money to pay for it anymore, you re in trouble ss: You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? JR:It s a been a long term adage in the investment world that you buy when there s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you re probably going to make a lot of money in the end unless the world comes to an end I don t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy I ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high that s what I m trying to do ss: Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now JR:I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I ll tell you I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine You don t buy something just because it s low because it can get lower and lower and lower I d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it s going to continue to be in turmoil If you ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10 15 years you know what I m talking about Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now ss: So what are you thinking how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? JR:I would suspect that it s going to America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said No, we re not going to do this anymore, we don t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia ù Europeans don t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it s doing nothing It doesn t hurt the Russians doesn t seem to There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don t suspect that this is going to last much longer ss: Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you re looking at non energy companies Is it right? JR: I have plenty of energy investment, so I m not investing in energy companies in Russia I m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy ss: Well, that s what I was going to ask you what do you invest in, in Russia? JR:I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares I own shares of the Moscow s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I m looking for other areas to invest I don t have any others yet, but I m looking ss: Look, I ve got a sense from what you re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia Is that s how it works, exactly? JR:I said, if there are more sanctions ù Washington keeps saying they re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will That s what they say they re going to do, they probably will do it And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while I have no idea of what s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak But it often does ss: Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well known basic strategy but you re not afraid for the long term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? JR:No, of course My point about sanctions is that they don t seem to be hurting Russia, I don t see that there s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don t go along with them, or don t go along with them in a big way I don t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short term It s just that I don t see it ss: With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? JR:Yes I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you ve probably know Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren t very viable, that they haven t hurt Russia in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they re doing more business with China China is a pretty successful economy, so it s not hurting, and in some ways it s actually helping Russia, because it s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals It s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars ss: Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let s say, during your lifetime? JR:During my lifetime? ss: Yep JR:Well, I hope I ll live a long time, Sophie, so yes I hope I ll live a long, long time ss: Well, we hope too But tell me one more thing: do you think there s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? JR:Oh, I m sure we will If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they re going to take advantage of it So, no, it s happening ss: You have said that you re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center you really think it has what it takes? JR:No, what I ve said was that I m astonished that they think that, that they re going to try I don t know if they can make that Mr Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center I m astonished I ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive Whether it works or not in 10 15 years? I don t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center ss: Talking about 10 15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age Is that where the future is, in China? JR:In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world ss: Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? JR:Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life I ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years I do think I see opportunities and therefore I m investing ss: So when did you first come to Russia? JR:I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years I knew I wouldn t work But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I ve started investing in Russia ss: So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? JR:No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn t as bad as it had been for 46 years ss: I want to ask one more question about China I m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn t suffered any crises yet But, it might at some point, like all markets do so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? JR:Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it s going to affect some people If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering That s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now It s just like if America has problems; it affects a lot of people If Japan has problems, it affects some people So there is no question that China will have problems I don t know what, or when, or why but every country has problems, somewhere along the line What is a little bit unusual is that it s been a long time since China has had major problems That is extremely unusual That s one reason I m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I m waiting in case there s a problem coming out of China If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I m smart enough to buy more china ss: Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/161436-china-russia-investment-rogers/
"3 Apr, 2014",Billionaire George Soros behind major push for marijuana legalization,"Hungarian American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros is no stranger when it comes to throwing around money, but the former hedge fund manager is making headlines over some major donations he s made to help legalize marijuana On the heels of the approval of two of the United States first
 recreational laws in Colorado and Washington, other locales
 across the country are considering implementing policy changes
 that could decriminalize pot, ease penalties for users or
 eliminate weed laws altogether Advocacy groups are leading the
 campaign to crush marijuana prohibition from coast to coast, and
 83 year old Soros is helping line the pockets of those making
 that push On Wednesday this week, Kelly Riddell atThe Washington Timespulled back the curtain
 to reveal details about some of the roles that Soros has played
 in the pro weed debate, and helped explain how the billionaire s
 many foundations are fighting the war against pot prohibition Through a network of nonprofit groups, Mr Soros has spent
 at least $80 million on the legalization effort since 1994, when
 he diverted a portion of his foundation s funds to organizations
 exploring alternative drug policies, according to tax
 filings, ùRiddell wrote The Soros affiliated Foundation to Promote an Open
 Societydonates roughly $4 million annually to the Drug Policy Alliance,
 Riddell added, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the
 nation s leading organization promoting drug policies that are
 grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights Soros
 is among the group of board members who help steer policy reform
 efforts undertaken by that organization, which has contributed to
 the successful attempts in both Colorado and Washington state to
 legalize recreational marijuana, as well as in Uruguay where last
 year the South American country became the first in the world to
 allow for the regulation, distribution and sale of weed to legal
 adults Records obtained by the Times also reveal that Soros cuts other
 substantial checks annually to the American Civil Liberties
 Union, which in turn funds marijuana legalization
 efforts, ù Riddell wrote, as well as the Marijuana Policy
 Project which funds state ballot measures In 2013, the MPP
 ranked Soros as the ninth most influential marijuana user in the
 US, behind President Barack Obama, television host Oprah Winfrey
 and a handful of other politicians and celebrities The co director and spokesperson for that group, Mason Tvert,
 told the Times that MPP and the Drug Policy Alliance are planning
 to support full legalization measures in the near future in the
 states of Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine, Montana and
 Nevada, and Soros himself has advocated on behalf of previous
 attempts to abolish pot prohibition in at least one of those
 locales Ahead of an attempt in November 2010 to legalize weed in
 California through the failed Proposition 19, Soros wrote an
 op ed for theWall Street Journalin which he called the
 since failed initiative a major step forward ù In many respects, of course, Proposition 19 already is a
 winner no matter what happens on Election Day, ù Soros wrote
 then The mere fact of its being on the ballot has elevated
 and legitimized public discourse about marijuana and marijuana
 policy in ways I could not have imagined a year ago ù Soros declined to be interviewed for the Times article published
 this week, but he s more than likely enthused about the approval
 of pro weed laws in Colorado and Washington carried out after
 Prop 19 was defeated in the polls And with regards to
 initiatives up for vote during the 2014 election, Riddell wrote
 that Soros is once again playing a substantial role In Florida, Mr Soros has teamed up with multimillionaire
 and Democratic fundraiser John Morgan to donate more than 80
 percent of the money to get medical marijuana legalization on the
 ballot through its initiative United for Care, People United for
 Medical Marijuana, ù Riddell wrote, and the MPP is
 focusing a lot of time and resources passing bills ù in
 Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and
 Vermont, according to her report It s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized
 under federal law, ù Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the
 Marijuana Majority advocacy group, told the Times We now
 have 20 states plus the District of Columbia considering
 legalization efforts, two states have already legalized it for
 all adults over the age of 21 î politicians will have to follow
 the will of the people on this ù AsRT reportedpreviously, the results of a Pew
 Research Center poll released last year found that 52 percent of
 Americans support the legalization of marijuana Despite recently
 approved laws in Washington and Colorado, marijuana remains an
 illegal narcotic under federal law ù ",https://www.rt.com/usa/soros-mpp-times-marijuana-189/
"2 Apr, 2014",US-Ukraine loan ‚Äòfinal rape and plunder by the West‚Äô,"The law approved by Congress to grant a one billion dollar loan to Ukraine is only a loan guarantee and will not even dent Ukraine s huge debts, 25 billion of which must be paid this year, William Engdahl, a geopolitical analyst, told RT William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com The bill will also give more power to American NGO s to promote
 democracy in Ukraine, many of the same NGOs that helped create
 the current instability in Kiev This is the last thing Ukraine
 needs at the moment, says Engdahl RT:Washington is offering Ukraine a one
 billion dollar loan Is it a good deal for Ukraine? William Engdahl:If you look at the details of
 what they re offering, they re not offering a loan of even one
 billion dollars They are offering a loan guarantee and the cost
 of that loan guarantee is that Ukraine submits to IMF austerity
 like Greece did, and that will simply open up their economy to
 the final rape and plunder from the West But the other point about this is that the debt of Ukraine that
 comes due this year is a staggering amount I believe it is some
 25 billion dollars that has to be rolled over And a one billion
 dollar loan guarantee it s hard to know who is more stupid in
 this piece of legislation: the United States congressmen, who
 voted for this, or the non elected government of Ukraine, if they
 accept this because it is simply a no brainer on all sides RT:Also the bill gives more power to
 America s co called democracy promoting ù NGOs Are these the
 same NGOs that reportedly helped topple the democratically
 elected government there in Ukraine a few weeks ago? WE:Of course, they are They are the National
 Endowment for Democracy (NED), Freedom House, no doubt, the Open
 Society Foundations of George Soros, who always seems to be
 paired up with these organizations John McCain is the chairman
 of the NED s International Republican Institute He has been on
 the front row of every regime stabilization in recent years So
 these are not democracy promoting NGOs, these are coup d √©tat
 NGOs, who are doing what the CIA used to do, only through private
 agencies that are backed up by the US government This is not anything good for Ukraine Ukraine doesn t need this
 nonsense It s interference in the domestic affairs of a
 sovereign country But since when has Washington or at least the
 Congress been concerned about that? RT:So, if they are not going to promote
 democracy, how exactly are their NGOs going to influence
 political life in Ukraine? WE:Well, as you pointed out, the NGOs prepared
 the way for the last several years, well before the decision not
 to join the EU confederation agreement taken by Viktor
 Yanukovich s government last November They had been preparing to
 oust the Moscow leaning Yanukovich, a fairly elected presidentof
 Ukraine, and create the incident using canvas operatives from
 Belgrade financed by US taxpayers money, to train activists
 assembled in Maidan Square and create the movement that shapes
 exactly what the government will or will not be able to do And to do more of that for Ukraine I think Ukraine needs a
 little break from all of this ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-ukraine-loan-ngo-945/
"28 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIntellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"14 Mar, 2014",'Britain‚Äôs being relegated to lowest tier in EU‚Äô - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near death state of Ukrainian finances but doesn t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it s great to have you with us today I m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously the EU s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine ù Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them how and why? Bill Cash:I m very much in favor of political cooperation, I m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious It would have been far better if it had been a lower key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was misconceived ùand he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I ll just quote from it: This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits ùIn retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn t been so ambitious I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely na√Øve I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation ss: But what about now, Mr Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it s on the brink of bankruptcy can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is No ù, and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this because when they say 35 billion ùyou can usually add quite a lot more The fact is that proportionately, we re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt ss: But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won t end up in the new elite s pockets? BC:Well, that s a very important question It could apply to almost any country of the EU The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years so the probability of the money getting astray is very very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption That is well known Quite frankly, we don t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don t think the money is there to pay for it ss: Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don t know What I do know is that there are very big questions here I mean, I m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well negotiated answer to these problems I m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years ss: Keeping in mind everything you ve said right now, Mr Cash and talking about being realistic what do you think about Ukraine s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries I m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said we should be associated, but not absorbed ù, and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U S and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating ss: Yeah, but it doesn t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break I m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U S diplomats which openly dismiss the EU s efforts in Ukraine should the EU swallow its pride and follow America s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the European Union must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy I m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU It is just simply a complete mess, and I don t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy ss: The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I ve seen the regulations in question In fact, I m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you ù, and given the fact that everyone is saying there won t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very very bad situation When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better ss: Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don t regard the EU as having its own money as such it s a way of interpreting the situation When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it As far as I m concerned, it s our money and I m very glad we re getting it back again I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself ss: Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem As one EU official put it, the scale of it is breathtaking ù Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking I may say that I wouldn t exonerate any country, I don t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world It s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy It s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts All I can say is that it has to be dealt with The court of Auditors of the EU do their best We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly every year I ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn t been signed off, as far as I m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether ss: Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don t think that the consequences and this is a very large subject of majority voting and co decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically I don t think that s healthy, as I ve said in Germany itself, I don t think it s healthy for Germany and I don t think it s healthy for Europe as a whole ss: Now you ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two tier Europe which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I ve said over this, over the last 20 years there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time ss: Talking about great democracy and protecting it you ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I ve just said By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy ss: But, here s another thing You ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream what s changed? BC:Well, I think that s the recognition that it didn t work It has taken a very very long time People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right not with any great self satisfaction, because as far as I m concerned, it s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s ss: Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land mass Unlike France it is a relatively small land mass And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded I am actually not in principle against immigration I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen But, by the same token, there have to be limits An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain s membership of the EU That s it for this edition of the Sophie&Co, we ll see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/british-mp-eu-problems-738/

 from US hardliners with their you re either with us or
 against us rhetoric A decade ago Iraq was branded a rogue state ; today, moderate estimates speak of an Iraqi
 death toll of 500,000 since the 2003 invasion and civil
 war Iraq is clearly the most famous rogue state, if we are to believe
 the two Bushes, especially the junior George, who rammed into
 that country in 2003, all but destroying it, maiming its people
 and proud 3,000 year old heritage † All based on an outright
 lie: the infamous weapons of mass destruction they were accused
 of hiding, but that were never found In those days of hysterical mainstream media warmongering George
 W , Tony Blair and their henchmen had their way, bombing the
 country to smithereens A decade on, we learn from areportjust published in the Public Library of
 Science Medicine Journal that, based on household samplings, an
 estimated 500,000 men, women and children have been killed since
 the invasion A moderate estimate, since others go significantly higher Take
 The Lancet, one of the world s oldest medical journals, which
 published two peer reviewed studies, the latest in 2006 putting
 the figure in excess of 650,000 Or ORB (Opinion Research
 Business) an independent polling agency in London, which in 2007
 published a study estimating total Iraqi war fatalities between
 2003 and 2007 at over 1 2 million All because Bush, Blair and their allies got it all wrong ù about
 Saddam s WMD s: We never found em, ùsaid George
 W , who then went on to joke about the whole affair during a
 White House dinner in March 2004 Clearly, blatant genocide and war crimes committed by the West s
 top leaders in broad daylight over which nobody seems to be
 responsible No one was ever made accountable; no one ever
 bothered to apologize to Iraq or to the world I guess they ve all been too busy going after and smokin out 
 other rogue states like Syria, where the civil war against the
 legal government of Bashar Assad that is being waged by US, UK,
 French, Saudi and Israeli backed/trained/financed terrorists
 (including Al Qaeda offshoot Al Nusra Front) has already cost
 over 120,000 Syrian deaths, mostly civilian Then there was Libya in 2011, where interim democratic 
 government estimates speak of as many as 30,000 dead, including
 the execution of Muammar Gaddafi and many of his family members
 and government officials God only knows how many were actually
 shot, bombed, and lynched like Gaddafi by the NATO backed
 freedom fighters there Add to this the impossible to calculate number of dead, maimed
 and murdered during the Western Powers engineered Arab
 Spring throughout the Arab World over the past three years,
 plus the decades long Palestinian tragedy at the hands of their
 Israeli run Concentration Camp Kommandants, and we re talking
 about many millions of deaths which begin to echo the so, so
 oft repeated 6 million figure So be careful, world! † Make sure your country s not branded
 a rogue state , because if it is, then you re in for a
 lot of trouble! First of all, the term more importantly, the concept was made
 popular during the Clinton Administration It was formally
 introduced by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in 1994 when
 then National Security Advisor Anthony Lake published a report in
 CFR journal Foreign Affairs, claiming the reality of
 recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain
 outside the family [of democratic nations] but also assault its
 basic values ù In typical self righteous US ranting, he then went on to label
 North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Iran as rogue states That
 initial list grew with time to include Sudan, Afghanistan,
 Somalia, Serbia, Montenegro, Venezuela all backed by PsyWar
 name calling like Axis of Evil , Outposts of
 Tyranny and Terrorist States But, to understand what a rogue state is, we first need to
 understand what a rogue state is not in today s world according
 to the US/UK/EU/Israel Let s begin by describing the four things that every country must
 do in order not to be branded a rogue state by the global
 hegemons: 1) General behavior: Every nation must maintain unconditional and
 unflinching alignment to the present world order controlled and promoted by the global powers that are embedded
 deep inside key Western military powers, notably the US If a nation heeds, obeys, acclaims, pays tribute and is
 subservient to the on going economic, financial, political,
 historical and cultural world outlook and order, and remains
 passive whilst the global powers prepare the coming new world
 order whether under the guise of the Western
 democracies , or globalization , or the
 international community or, soon to come, World
 Government then you re OK If, however, a nation dares defy any aspect of this, it will soon
 find itself slipping fast into rogue state mode That s
 what happened to Saddam in 1990 after he invaded Kuwait without
 first getting the proper green light from the US; that s
 what happened to Argentina s pro US military junta in 1982 when
 General Galtieri tried to take back the Falkland Islands from
 Britain without Washington s OK 2) Specific behavior: Then, every nation must maintain
 unconditional alignment to specific US/UK/EU/Israel dictated special interests involving the country and its region 
 This naturally varies from country to country and fluctuates as
 specific interests of the hegemon evolve † Some examples: ¢ Egypt: Total alignment to Israel and its geopolitical
 interests That was quite a historical somersault for Gamal
 Nasser s country to make, considering that for decades Egypt
 spearheaded Arab opposition to the West s imposing of Israel on
 Palestinian territory Hosni Mubarak was their man who for 32
 years kept Egypt on course until † Until he
 stupidly breached condition No 3 (see below) ¢ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain:
 Keep the oil flowing, be nice to our oil companies and to Israel,
 and your leaders can do whatever else they like (see 4, below) ¢ Argentina: Never, ever launch a proper investigation into the
 country s decades old mostly illegitimate even illegal public
 debt rooted in the 1976 1983 US backed military regime Because if Argentina were to do that it could then declare huge
 chunks of it as odious debt suing the mega bankers in
 US/EU courts Such table turning would make Goldman Sachs,
 Citigroup, JPMorganChase, HSBC, the IMF/WorldBank/FED and vulture
 funds really angry One other thing: now that your 30 year old
 democracy has destroyed Argentina s armed forces and sunk the
 country into unprecedented decadence, don t even think of making
 a policy U turn Keep all of this going and your leaders too can
 do whatever else they like (see 4, below) 3) Internal control & credibility: However, if a nation s
 leadership behaves nicely , yet cannot control its own
 population and maintain domestic credibility, then like it or
 not, we re going to have to replace you † And if you don t
 like it, well, they will just make you an offer you can t a Hosni Mubarak of Egypt: When the Tahrir Square uprising began
 he proved unable to maintain order and credibility It turned out
 that 32 years is just too long stay in power even with US money
 and support, so out the window he went When Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton visited Egypt in March 2011 to make sure
 Egypt gets the kind of democracy that we want to see, ùMuslim
 Brotherhood president Morsi was not what she had in mind, so he
 too went out the window thanks to a US backed military coup Aren t military coups supposed to be done by undemocratic
 SOB s? † Yes, but as President Franklin Roosevelt once
 famously said of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, he may
 be an SOB, but he s our SOB! ù b Fernando de La R√∫a of Argentina: Elected in 1999, he was 110
 percent compliant with (1) and (2) above, however he was most
 inept in the way he bled the country so it would pay its pound of
 flesh to international mega bankers His internal credibility and
 grip collapsed and Fernando was forced to escape aboard his
 chopper from the roof of the Casa Rosada presidential palace into
 oblivion, as his police killed and beat up protesters on the
 Plaza de Mayo square below Twelve years on, with Argentina s democracy about to
 celebrate its 30th anniversary, its present political managers
 are again losing grip: a new bout of spares and replacements 
 are thus needed, and you can bet your bottom dollar that they
 have been identified and are being positioned to become
 Argentina s soon to come new government Just make sure
 that they too continue being serial debt payers to the
 global mega bankers as president Cristina Kirchner recently
 described her and her husband s more than 10 year tenure in
 power 4) Corruption galore: The global powers message to all national
 political leaders: as long as you fully perform and comply with
 (1), (2) and (3) above, you can sink your grubby hands into all
 the money you want The message is clear: perform as we need you
 to perform on the above key issues, and we don t really care if
 you steal millions, hundreds of millions or even billions from
 your own people, whether by imposing endemic poverty on the local
 population or as outright theft CitiCorp, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros, Goldman Sachs, US
 Treasury, the IMF & World Bank couldn t care less if Mubarak,
 Berlusconi, Rajoy, Fujimori, Menem, Calder√≥n, Lula and Kirchner
 steal from their own people If they can get away with it whilst
 maintaining their local credibility and grip, it s just not an
 issue If anything it s an added asset for the elite, because
 should such local leaders misbehave , they can then be
 easily blackmailed out of power That, in a nutshell, is how the global powers exert control over
 whole countries and regions by ensuring their chosen local
 managers are placed at the helm of national governments to do
 the elites dirty work for them As long as these leaders behave
 and perform properly they can stay on for decades just like
 Hosni Mubarak If they misbehave or their useful lives expire, they re
 then quickly shown the exit and shoved out the door When their
 crimes and thefts are publicly exposed their own local
 populations will do the kicking out for them Saddam was so useful during the eight year war of attrition
 against Iran in the 80s (Iran was Ronald Reagan s original rogue
 state), even Don Rumsfeld shook Saddam s hand and gave him
 chemical WMD s to use against Iran s Ayatollahs After Kuwait,
 however, Ronnie s Veep the Elder Bush gave Saddam quite a
 thrashing, but he didn t learn his lesson So Baby Bush taught
 him good in 2003 Sure, it s not all that simple: each country has its own
 characteristics, its own problems, its own usefulness for the
 global powers In fact, each country is a testing ground and a
 learning ground, the lessons of which are later put to good use
 in other countries and regions So, nations of the world: you ve been warned When walking
 amongst fierce beasts, make sure you do so quietly, cautiously
 and discreetly Be not too defiant lest you too are branded a rogue state Then
 you ll be in real trouble! Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

"4 Jul, 2013",‚ÄòMorsi ousted with US blessing‚Äô,"From its inception the uprising against President Morsi was aided by the US, researcher and writer Soraya Sepahpour Ulrich told RT She argues that whoever succeeds the ousted Egyptian leader will likely be beholden to the forces that put him in power Morsi displacement is a military coup in the first place RT:What do you think the future holds for Mohamed
 Morsi now? Soraya Sepahpour Ulrich:I don t think Mohamed Morsi has
 any place to go to really There might be a lot of jubilation
 that the military has removed him from office President Morsi
 did make himself very unpopular not only inside Egypt but with
 his neighbors, the surrounding countries But that being said,
 the implications are huge as he was democratically elected And
 for the army to step in and remove him from office is a military
 coup and it is very hard for me to believe that the military
 would have taken this step without the blessing of the United
 States I know that the Americans said, President Obama said, that they
 would review aid to Egypt But [US Secretary of Defense] Chuck
 Hagel had been on the phone with Egypt for two or three days 
 Egypt basically owes its military, owes its existence to the
 United States of America This is not a step they would take
 without their blessings Mohamed Morsi may be out now, but his followers will not be and
 we ll only see an escalation of clashes, which is very
 unfortunate for the Egyptian people RT:You talk about the support the Egyptian military
 got from the US But live video from Tahrir Square suggests that
 there are people out there, a significant if not a majority of
 the Egyptian population who also want Morsi out of power SSU:I m not arguing with that, I m talking about a
 military that gets its support from the United States You have
 to understand that a lot of people that are on Tahrir Square
 right now, many of them are not supporters of Morsi The military
 actually put tanks against Morsi s supporters and was very quick
 to arrest them There are people on the streets A lot of them may be opposed to
 Morsi because of the laws that he wanted to establish, but a lot
 of it is also the economy The [Egyptian] economy is very poor,
 these are very poor people A lot of them are out there maybe
 protesting the fact that President Morsi was not able to improve
 the economic conditions better over the last year he had in
 office Again, for the military to have stepped in and removed him from
 power, and especially for General [Chief of the Egyptian Armed
 Forces, Abdul Fatah Khalil] Al Sisi, who was instrumental in
 blocking and enabling the Israelis to kill the Gazans, for them
 rejoicing over that is just mindboggling The [Egyptian] military
 is an instrument of the United States of America, and the
 billions [of dollars] in support it has gotten for years now goes
 towards maintaining peace with Israel, not to serve Egyptian
 people Very soon the Egyptian people will wake up and realize that they
 are perhaps cheering the wrong faction RT:The military, having pushed Morsi out of power now,
 do you think they have a plan who will lead the country next? SSU:Again, America has invested a lot of time and money
 into this Ever since 2007, America knew that former President
 Mubarak was dying of cancer There was even a New York Times
 article in 2007 talking about who would be his replacement Since
 2008, they would have young Egyptians coming to America, go to
 the State Department, meet at the time Condoleezza Rice and
 others, and learn how to use modern technology to start an
 uprising in Egypt So this uprising from the very start was aided by the United
 States and one of the favorite horses in the race has been and
 continues to be [Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader]
 Mohammed ElBaradei He is the one who actually met with the
 military to remove Morsi Interestingly enough, ElBaradei is a member of the International
 Crisis Group, which is funded by George Soros and also the
 Carnegie Endowment and Ford Foundation, which during the Cold War
 was a conduit for CIA money Although some have said that Mohamed
 ElBaradei [when he served as Director General of the
 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)] never pushed hard
 enough to say that Iran was developing a nuclear program and
 Israel might have had issues with that, he is in fact a favorite
 [to succeed Morsi] and he is coming up very prominently right
 now RT:Do you think this is bad for the country right now?
 Mohammed ElBaradei is internationally respected figure, widely
 regarded as moderate and pro democratic force for Egypt SSU:ElBaradei absolutely is But it is bad for any
 country when somebody is helped from the outside from forces
 without to bring this person to power Then that person will automatically turn into a puppet Their
 concern will not be for what is good for the country , their
 concern is their ambition, and that is always dangerous, whether
 they are moderate or fundamentalist it does not matter It
 should be an Egyptian decision RT:If he is elected into office do you think that
 there will be a legitimate popular support for him? SSU:I think that the people will have to decide But
 ultimately, should he be elected into office, which is very
 likely, one has to remember where he comes from and how he got to
 become so prominent and whose support he has A lot of times it happens in every country and we re not aware of
 the forces behind a figurehead or a given politician And once
 that plays out, you might realize that it is a bit too late to
 change the course But let s hope for the best I don t think that the followers of President Morsi will sit back
 and take this very quietly My hope and my wish for Egypt is to see a very peaceful process
 from here on But I doubt that will be the case I think chaos
 will prevail RT:Why do you say chaos will prevail? SSU:The Muslim Brotherhood followers, the people that put
 Morsi into power, they feel disenfranchised In fact, all though
 one does not want to see this conflict at all, they are the ones
 who have more right to backing the democratically elected
 president than anyone else If they feel they don t really count anymore, that their votes
 and voices don t count, they are going to show reaction, I think
 it is normal ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/sepahpour-egypt-revolution-america-638/

the sheer inhumanity of it all, even in the European Union where
double digit unemployment is rampant, banks are fraudulently
 bailed in by stealing account holders money, and millions of
workers houses are foreclosed on There just does not seem to be anything anybody anywhere can do
about it It all basically boils down to the vast majority of working people

blatant discrimination of all: when small but extremely powerful,
unelected and illegitimate minorities discriminate against the vast
majority of disorganized and as yet unawakened citizens This is not a conspiracy theory or any such rubbish This is

of decadence where its workers have been sucked into an economic
Eurocratic maelstrom that finally led to his resignation in
November 2011, the Megabankers decided at the time to take over
Italy outright That was when they replaced Berlusconi with Mario Monti of
Trilateral Commission glory as Italy s prime minister, aswe then explained on RT Now, after Italy s recent elections we saw its aging President
Giorgio Napolitano again put a Rockefeller/Rothschild Boy in power;
because Enrico Letta too is a Trilateral Commission member And to
make sure that Megabanker theft is duly supplemented by traditional
Italian political mafias, Letta s coalition government includes
members of Berlusconi s party After all, his uncle Gianni Letta
was/is Berlusconi s right hand man So, yes indeed: Poor
Italy! The Trilateral Commission brings together Rockefeller, Morgan,
Warburg, Rothschild, Lazard, Goldman Sachs and Soros banking
interests under the aegis of global power elite geopolitical
planners like Sir Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Dominique
Mo√Øsi, Richard Perle, Philip Zelikow and Paul Wolfowitz, amongst
many others Notably, both PMs, the outgoing Mario Monti and incoming Enrico
Letta, serve the Trilateral Agenda shoulder to shoulder with the
top brass from such global megabanks as CitiCorp, HSBC, Barclays,
Nomura, Banco Santander, BBVA Bank, UBS, NM Rothschild, Deutsche
Bank, BNP, Commerzbank, † Goldman Sachs, Lazard, Mediobanca,
Morgan Stanley, Warburg Pincus, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of New
York Mellon, and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Overworld banking
agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal
Reserve Bank, Bank of England, European Central Bank, Dutch Central
Bank, Bank of † Greece, and Bank of Japan † Just a
sampling to show that this is a most powerful high class money club
if ever there was one At 70, Monti is an elderly man; at 46, Letta is a promising young
politician In Italian politics it seems that the more things
change, the more they stay the same The key question that should once again be on every Italian s mind
is: will Enrico Letta work to improve the plight of the Italian
people or to promote bankers interests? Former Argentine President
Juan Per√≥n once said that all nations presidents and premiers have
a foremost decision to make: they either govern to promote and
protect the interests of their people over and above those of the
global megabankers, or they merely work for the global megabankers
and against their own people It s a political coin that has had to be tossed by leaders time and
again since the times of Jesus † Those making the right
decision for their people often end up ousted, assassinated and
demonized Looking at the list and track records of Trilateralists who have
been catapulted into the highest echelons of power in government 
Papademos in Greece, Monti in Italy, Cavallo in Argentina, Bill
Clinton and George HW Bush in the US, Horst Kohler in Germany,
Toomas Ilves in Estonia, Condoleezza and Susan Rice (yes, both of
them!) in the US one can see a pattern So, yes: friends, Romans and countrymen everywhere, the Trilateral
Commission certainly does nave enormous clout and leverage to
promote its globalist agenda over and above every country s
national interest Letta s ascent to become Italy s new prime minister a country
with huge economic, financial, social and political problems once
again raises the question: Who decides?Is it the Italian people who have freely and democratically chosen
to have an elite megabanker friendly bureaucrat run their country
or as in Greece, France, the UK and so many other countries is
there a hidden hand that discretely catapults its own servants into
the highest places of power?Do We, the People ever really decide anything or are we just
asked to legitimize through some high profile election, decisions
they have already taken? Do our real political choices thus boil
down to two, maybe three, elite candidates? A sort of
 you can have Coke or Pepsi non choice?If this only happened in Italy, we could say that it s some sort of
 Italian problem † But, no: there s clearly a pattern whereby
global power brokers first recruit and then very discretely promote
their chosen players to the top echelons of entities like the
Trilateral Commission where they are suitably groomed, positioned,
prepared, coached and politically and financially armed 
Normally, such individuals have little or no allegiance to their
countries of origin and countrymen, but rather are align to the
supranational globalist agenda And they plan well in advance too! † An April 27 FoxNews TV
report just aired a pro Bush Family program showing that The Powers
That Be are already busy toying with the idea that Jeb Bush 
another Baby Bush might just be the right guy to run for
president of the United States on the Republican Party ticket in
2016 s presidential elections Not surprisingly, many powerful Democrats are, in turn, already
working to put Hillary Clinton as their candidate for those
presidentials That would mean that in 2016 the American people just might have to
choose between Jeb Bush (son of Trilateral member George HW Bush)
and Hillary Clinton (wife of Trilateralist Bill Clinton) † I
know, I know: just a coincidence Come to think of it, maybe the title of this article should not
just be Poor Italy , but rather Poor Italy and Greece
and Argentina and Germany and USA and Estonia and Benjamin Disraeli British Queen Victoria s prime minister in the
19th century once said that ÄúThe world is governed by very
different personages from what is imagined by those who are not
behind the scenes ÄùA lucid vision from someone who was in a position to know †

"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their
associated think tanks in being effective representatives of their
constituencies ùIRI is chaired by conservative Senator John
McCain, known for his extremely aggressive position in favor of
Israel and US conflicts overseas, while other leading figures have
held senior foreign policy positions in the Reagan and Bush
administrations IRI works in countries important to U S 
interests, where we can make a difference IRI focuses on three
tasks: helping political parties broaden their appeal, ensuring
that they rule justly once elected and aiding civilsociety in
guaranteeing good governance IRI can help catalyze the efforts of
democratic activists in a country so long as they want change
more than we want it for them, ùwrites IRI s president, Lorne
Craner, who previously held a position in the US State
Department The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also
receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the Open Society
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
"19 Mar, 2013",King of the past reaching for Malaysia oil reserves,"Malaysia, boasting the third largest oil reserves in the Asia Pacific region, finds itself on the verge of a military fight over its richest region Malaysia has been in the midst of an ongoing security crisis
since early February, when a group of 235 rag tag militiamen from
the neighboring southern Philippines slipped into the eastern state
of Sabah and began occupying several villages While engaging
police in multiple firefights, the insurgents beheaded and
mutilated several captured Malaysian security personnel, prompting
Malaysian forces to deploy fighter jets in an unprecedented air
assault over the area in an operation to flush out the intruders 
The gunmen call themselves the Royal Army of the Sulu Sultanate, 
representing the heirs of a long defunct kingdom which once
controlled the territory up until the late nineteenth century The
so called Sultan of Sulu, Jamalul Kiram III, who is believed to be
directing the militant incursion from Manila, insists that Sabah is
rightfully part of his kingdom and has vowed not budge on his
claims even if his personnel are killed in the standoff Malaysians, who are preparing to vote in a pivotal general
election just around the corner, have been fixated on events in
Sabah as they unfold The Philippines are soon expecting
congressional elections as well, and given the timing, local
analysts are wondering how exactly did this elderly self proclaimed
Sultan obtain the resources needed to establish his own private
army Both the Malaysian and Philippine governments have launched
official investigations into allegations that figures within
Malaysia s political opposition had a hand in aiding the Sulu
gunmen Reuters cited an anonymous Filipino military officer who
claimed that Sulu rebels were invited to Sabah by a Malaysian
opposition politician The blame has been laid on Malaysia s de facto opposition
leader, Anwar Ibrahim, who Malaysian reports say has links to
Filipino insurgent networks that have long eyed the resource rich
state of Sabah in northern eastern Borneo Local journalist Adrian
Lai recently unearthed classified diplomatic cables from the US
embassy in Manila brought to light by WikiLeaks, which document
ties between Nur Misauri, former chairmen of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), and Malaysia s main opposition leader
Anwar Ibrahim The MNLF is a political movement that pitted itself
against predominately Christian Manila by seeking political
autonomy for Muslim majority provinces in the islands in the
southern Philippines In 2001, Manila accused Misauri of terrorism
when he led an MNLF unit that attacked an outpost of the Philippine
army, prompting him to seek refuge in Sabah on the assumption that
authorities in Muslim majority Malaysia would empathize with him
and block his extradition Misauri was detained by Malaysian
security forces in Sabah and sent back to the Philippines where he
was jailed until 2008 WikiLeaks cables claim that Misauri detested the Malaysian
government for turning him over to Philippine authorities and that
he was a strong advocate for the recovery of Sabah The cables
claim that Misauri boasted that his militias could invade Sabah in
the span of two hours WikiLeaks has also confirmed that Misauri
maintained close connections to Anwar Ibrahim, and that the two had
met on several occasions A separate report issued by AFP cited US
diplomatic cables that implicate a Saudi Arabian ambassador to the
Philippines of funding Muslim groups seeking autonomy in the
southern islands Misauri recently criticized Philippine President
Benigno Aquino for siding with Malaysia in his firm stance against
the Sulu militants, warning the Aquino government of chaos if Sulu
Sultan Jamalul Kiram III is apprehended Anwar Ibrahim, who has vehemently denied all accusations, has
long been considered a darling of the West Mr Ibrahim is a
slippery character of sorts; he was once Malaysia s deputy prime
minister prior to being sacked for getting too close to the IMF,
among other things Anwar also has friends in high places, from
billionaire financier George Soros to senior neo cons from the Bush
administration In recent times, Ibrahim has appealed to Carl
Gershman, president of the US Government funded foundation, the
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), requesting that he send a
US observer team to Malaysia to monitor the upcoming elections 
Ibrahim enraged many when he stated he would support policy to
protect the security of Israel, and while his political party has
long received training and backing from the International
Republican Institute (IRI) chaired by Republican Senator John
McCain, there little doubt that Anwar a creature of Washington s
taxpayer funded Democracy Promotion ù overseas would be the
trusted ally that the White House is looking for as it refocuses
its military muscle and political influence to the Asia Pacific
region Philippine President Benigno Aquino has recently conceded that
events in Sabah showed signs of a conspiracy A recent statement
issued by Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar
alludes to reports of Malaysian opposition figures promising land,
titles and other sinecures to the Sulu Sultanate if they emerged
victorious in the upcoming elections Muzaffar argues that a
security crisis in Sabah, regarded as a political stronghold for
the Barisan Nasional (BN) government, could weaken the ruling
parties hold over the state, leading to a hung parliament or a
narrow victory for the BN, prompting in his words, massive
street agitation which could pave the way for a regime change,
which is the goal of not only the Opposition but also its foreign
backers ù When Chandra talks of foreign backers, he is
referring to the US political establishment The MNLF, under its current chairmen Muslimin Sema, has issued
statements declaring that it disagreed with the incursion into
Sabah, but acknowledged that MNLF forces aligned to Misauri were
present there Reports issued by Reuters also cited Malaysian
officials who claimed that the Sulu terrorists had links to
factions that were unhappy with the Philippines recent peace
agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an
Islamist MNLF offshoot The Malaysian government facilitated these
peace talks, and Misauri made no secret that he publically opposed
them The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that some ten thousand
MNLF fighters from the southern Philippines planned to join the
insurgency in Sabah in solidarity with the Royal Sulu Army Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III has told media in the Philippines
that he wants the United Nations, the United States and the United
Kingdom to intervene in his claim over Sabah The Sultan claims
that the US must intercede, as agreed upon in a 1915 agreement
signed with Washington s then colonial government in the
Philippines that mandated the US provide full protection ù to the
Sulu Sultan in exchange for exercising sovereignty over the kingdom
as the colonial administration Let s not forget, the strategically
located state of Sabah is abundant in natural gas reserves, and its
oil reserves are the third highest in the Asia Pacific region after
China and India Sabah s fifteen oil wells produce as many as
192,000 barrels a day, while the country has holds over 4 billion
barrels of proven oil reserves In 2010, Malaysia was the world s
third largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar
and Indonesia The Malaysian government had paid a modest annual
cession payment to the Sultanate (which the Sultan argues is a
 rent ù) since gaining independence from Britain, and one of the
motivations for the Sultan s push to reclaim the territory is
definitely profit driven While the Pentagon refocuses over 60% of
its naval presence to the Asia Pacific region, conflicts of this
nature which deal with obstructions to the flow of abundant
energy resources to US companies are exactly the sort that could
coax the eventual involvement of US personnel if Sabah were to
deteriorate into a hotbed of Sulu terror The fact that individuals in the highest levels of the Malaysian
and Philippine governments are suspicious of a conspiracy does much
to lend credence to the possibility Former Malaysian PM Dr 
Mahathir Mohammad, an ardent critic of Israel and US imperialism,
warned months prior to the standoff in Sabah that the opposition s
Western backers sought to bring Anwar Ibrahim to power through Arab
Spring style street riots and even the use of fire power He cited
recent examples in Egypt and Syria where NATO states backed
political opposition figures and supported al Qaeda linked rebels
to act on their behalf in overthrowing governments they were tired
of Reports of Saudi Arabia financially supporting Philippine
terrorists should also not be taken lightly, as Gulf States have
moved in step with the US and NATO as the main financiers of
Salafist terrorist networks active in west Asia, north Africa and
elsewhere Without resorting to elaborate conspiracies in the absence of
hard facts, it would be entirely negligent to ignore circumstantial
evidence linking Malaysian figures to this insurgency, especially
considering all sources of this nature are non Malaysian in origin 
There is no doubt that the Sultan has no legitimate legal claims
over Sabah since the International Court of Justice has long
recognized Malaysia s rights and sovereignty over the territory,
and the highly unusual timing of the Sulu operation being so close
to elections in both countries will naturally be perceived as
suspect Militancy and terrorism undermines the Sultan s claims
entirely and lends much credibility to suspicion that the Sultan
has not acted alone Even if the US isn t involved, the fact that a
figure who received blatant US support has been implicated is
significant There is much at stake in Sabah, and in the words of
the Sultan, The only thing that could end the conflict is an
intervention ù The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/malaysia-sulu-sultan-security-462/
"20 Feb, 2013",‚ÄòCan‚Äôt keep weakening‚Äô: Japan suffers record trade deficit of $17.4 billion,"Japan has posted a record trade deficit of $17 4 billion in January, a signal to officials that a weakening yen may not be the key to boosting economic performance Japan s strategically weakened yen has helped increase exports
by 6 4% in January the first rise in exports in eight months but
growth in imports still far surpasses exports The Finance Ministry
released the figures in Tokyo Wednesday The trade deficit means the yen can t just keep
weakening, ù Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchuckin
Research Institute Co in Tokyo, told Bloomberg BusinessWeek The yen has fallen more than 13% against the dollar since Prime
Minister Abe Shinzo took office and began his aggressive monetary
crusade against deflation The yen opened at 93 57 to the dollar on
Wednesday The big growth in imports is intrinsically linked to the increased
demand for fossil fuels since the crippling 2011 nuclear plant
accident Most nuclear plant activity came to a halt after the
accident deepening Japan s dependence on imported energy Abe will probably restart some nuclear plants after the upper
house elections in July as, without them, the costs to the economy
are too great, ù Minami said Imports of petroleum products climbed 33 7% and natural gas climbed
11 4% in 2012 If Japan wants to reconcile its trade deficit, these
numbers need to decrease Other politics have also greatly impacted the huge deficit Demand
from the Eurozone (down 4 5%) hasn t fully recovered from the
crisis, and territorial disputes with China curbed exports to only

"26 Dec, 2012",US attempting regime change in Malaysia: Fact or fiction? (Op-Ed),"As the South East Asian nation of Malaysia prepares for general elections, distrust of the political opposition and accusations of foreign interference have been major talking points in the political frequencies emanating from Kuala Lumpur The United Malays National Organization (UMNO) leads the country s ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and has maintained power since Malaysian independence in 1957 One of Malaysia s most recognizable figures is former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been credited with ushering in large scale economic growth and overseeing the nation s transition from an exporter of palm oil, tin, and other raw materials, into an industrialized economy that manufactures automobiles and electronic goods The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who once held the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mahathir s administration, but was sacked over major disagreements on how to steer Malaysia s economy during the 1997 Asian financial crisis Today, the political climate in Malaysia is highly polarized and a sense of unpredictability looms over the nation Malaysia s current leader, Prime Minister Najib Razak, has pursued a reform minded agenda by repealing authoritarian legislation of the past and dramatically loosening controls on expression and political pluralism introduced under Mahathir s tenure Najib has rolled back Malaysia s Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detention without trial, and has liberalized rules regarding the publication of books and newspapers During Malaysia s 2008 general elections, the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition experienced its worst result in decades, with the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition winning 82 parliamentary seats For the first time, the ruling party was deprived of its two thirds parliamentary majority, which is required to pass amendments to Malaysia s Federal Constitution In the run up to elections scheduled to take place before an April 2013 deadline, figures from all sides of the political spectrum are asking questions about the opposition s links to foreign funders in Washington The question of foreign funding Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad has long captured the ire of officials from Washington and Tel Aviv, and though he s retired, he has channeled his energies into the Perdana Global Peace Foundation, which recently hosted an international conference in Kuala Lumpur calling for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 and has sought to investigate war crimes committed in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan Mahathir has been an ardent critic of Israel and organizations such as AIPAC, and has recently accused US based organizations the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) of holding a concealed intention to influence Malaysia s domestic politics through the funding of local NGOs and groups directly linked to Anwar Ibrahim s Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition In an article the former prime minister published in the New Straits Times, a leading mainstream newspaper, Mahathir accuses financier George Soros and his organization, the Open Society Institute, of promoting democracy ù in Eastern Europe to pave the way for colonization by global finance capital Mahathir acknowledges how OSI pumped millions into opposition movements and independent media in Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of strengthening civilsociety , only to have like minded individuals nominated by Soros s own foundation come to power in those countries The former prime minister has also pointed to how Egypt (prior to Mohamad Morsi taking power) has cracked down on NGOs affiliated with NED, namely groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and Freedom House, which are all recipients of funding from the US State Department In Malaysia, high profile NGOs and media outlets have admittedly received funding from OSI and satellite organizations of NED Premesh Chandran, the CEO of the nation s most prominent alternative media outlet, Malaysiakini, is a grantee of George Soros s Open Society Foundations and launched the news organization with a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok based Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), another organization with dubious affiliations to the US State Department Malaysiakini has come under pressure from local journalists for the lack of transparency in its financial management and hesitance in revealing the value of its shares Additionally, Suaram, an NGO promoting human rights, has borne heavy criticism over its funding and organizational structure The Companies Commission of Malaysia launched investigations into Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd, a private company linked to Suaram, and found it to be a conduit for money being used to channel funds from NED Suaram has been instrumental in legitimizing allegations of a possible cover up of the murder of a Mongolian fashion model, Altantuya Shaaribuu, who was living in Malaysia in 2006 and associated with government officials that have been linked to a kickback scandal involving the government s purchase of submarines from France Senator Ezam Mohd Nor, himself a recipient of Suaram s Human Rights Award, has accused the organization of employing poor research methods and attempting to disparage the government: Malaysians have the right to feel suspicious about them They have been making personal allegations against the Prime Minister [Najib Razak] on the murder of Altantuya and many other cases without proof their motive is very questionable especially when they are more inclined towards ridiculing and belittling the ruling government ùThe German Embassy in KL has reportedly admitted that it has provided funds to Suaram s project in 2010 Malaysia s Foreign Minister Anifah Aman followed by making strong statements to the German Ambassador and declared that Germany s actions could be viewed as interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the Open Society Institute Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton While Sreenevasan s organization claimed to be non partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations Anatomy of Malaysia s political opposition Malaysia is a multi cultural and multi religious state, and both the ruling and opposition parties attempt to represent the nation s three largest ethnic groups Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysians are either ethnic Malay or other indigenous groups and are mostly listed as Muslim, while another 25 per cent are ethnic Chinese who are predominantly Buddhist, with 7 per cent mostly Hindu Indian Malaysians The United Malays National Organization, the Malaysian Chinese Association, and the Malaysian Indian Congress head Barisan Nasional The opposition, Pakatan Rakyat, currently controls four state governments and is led by Anwar Ibrahim s Keadilan Rakyat, the Chinese led Democratic Action Party (DAP), and staunchly Islamist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) While a large percentage of urbanites with legitimate grievances are quick to acknowledge the government s shortcomings, many are hesitant to back Anwar Ibrahim due to his connections with neo conservative thinkers in Washington and general disunity within the opposition † Ibrahim maintains close ties with senior US officials and organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy In 2005, Ibrahim chaired the Washington based Foundation for the Future, established and funded by the US Department of State at the behest of Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of then Vice President Dick Cheney, thanks in large part to his cozy relationship with Paul Wolfowitz While Ibrahim was on trial for allegedly engaging in sodomy with a male aide (of which he was acquitted sometime later), Wolfowitz and former US Vice President Al Gore authored a joint opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in support of Ibrahim, while the Washington Post published an editorial calling for consequences that would affect Malaysia s relations with Washington if Ibrahim was to be found guilty Ibrahim enraged many when he stated that he would support policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview with the Wall Street Journal; this is particularly controversial in Malaysia, where support for Palestine is largely unanimous Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar writes: It is obvious that by acknowledging the primacy of Israeli security, Anwar was sending a clear message to the deep state and to Tel Aviv and Washington that he is someone that they could trust In contrast, the Najib government, in spite of its attempts to get closer to Washington, remains critical of Israeli aggression and intransigence Najib has described the Israeli government as a òserial killer and a ògangster ù Members of Barisan Nasional have addressed Ibrahim s connections to the National Endowment for Democracy in the Malaysian Parliament, including his participation in NED s òDemocracy Award event held in Washington DC in 2007 Independent journalists have uncovered letters written by Anwar Ibrahim, two of which were sent to NED President Carl Gershman in Washington DC that discussed sending an international election observer team to Malaysia and general issues related to electoral reform A third letter was sent to George Soros, expressing interest in collaborating with an accountability firm headed by Ibrahim Pakatan Rakyat s Communications Director, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, verified the authenticity of the documents This should come as little surprise, as Ibrahim s economic policies have historically aligned with institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, in contrast to Mahathir, whose protectionist economic policies opposed international financial institutions and allowed Malaysia to navigate and largely resurface from the 1997 Asian financial crisis unscathed An issue that concerns secular and non Muslim Malaysian voters is the role of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as part of the opposition In sharp contrast to the moderate brand of Islam preached by UMNO, the organization s primary objective is the founding of an Islamic state The PAS has spoken of working within the framework of Malaysia s parliamentary democracy, but holds steadfast to implementing sharia law on a national scale, which would lead to confusing implications for Malaysia s sizable non Muslim population The debate around the implementation of Islamic hudud penal code is something that other Pakatan Rakyat coalition members, such as figures in the Chinese led Democratic Action Party, have been unable to agree on The PAS enjoys support from rural Malay Muslims in conservative states such as Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu in northern Malaysia, though they have very limited appeal to urbanites While certain individuals in PAS have raised questions about NGOs receiving foreign funding, Mahathir has insinuated that PAS s leadership has been largely complicit: They [foreign interests] want to topple the government through the demonstration and Nik Aziz [Spiritual leader of PAS] said it is permissible to bring down the government in this manner They want to make Malaysia like Egypt, Tunisia, which were brought down through riots and now Syria when the government does not fall, they [Pakatan Rakyat] can appeal to the foreign power to help and bring down, even if it means using fire power ù Feasibility of òregime change narrative It must be acknowledged that the current administration led by Prime Minister Najib Razak has made great strides toward improving relations with Washington At a meeting with President Barack Obama in 2010, Najib offered Malaysia s assistance to cooperate with the United States to engage the Muslim world; Najib also expressed willingness to deploy Malaysian aid personnel to Afghanistan, and allegedly agreed on the need to maintain a unified front on Iran s nuclear program Najib has employed a Washington based public relations firm, APCO, to improve Malaysia s image in the US and has seemingly embraced American economic leadership of the region through his support for the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement Some would argue that Najib is perhaps the most pro American leader Malaysia has ever had † ì a stark contrast to the boldness of Mahathir Despite Najib having good rapport with formal Western leaders, it is clear with whom the thank tank policy architects, Zionist lobbies, and foundation fellows have placed their loyalties Sentiment among Malaysia s youth and pro democracy ù activists, who constitute a small but vocal minority, tend be entirely dismissive of the òregime change narrative, viewing it as pre election diversionary rhetoric of the ruling party While bogeymen of the Zionist variety are often invoked in Malaysian political discourse, it would be negligent to ignore the effects of Washington sponsored òdemocracy promotion in the global context, which have in recent times cloaked mercenary elements and insurgents in the colors of freedom fighting, and successfully masked geopolitical restructuring and the ushering in of neo liberal capitalism with the hip and fashionable vigor of òpeople power coups As the United States continues to militarily increase its presence in the Pacific region in line with its strategic policy shift to East Asia, policy makers in Washington would like to see compliant heads of state who will act to further American interests in the ASEAN region Let s not ignore the elephant in the room; the real purpose of America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify the region as a counterweight against Beijing The defense ministries of Malaysia and China held a landmark defense and security consultation in September 2012, in addition to frequent bilateral state visits and enhanced economic cooperation It was the father of the current leader, Malaysia s second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, who made the landmark visit to Beijing to normalize relations in 1974, and under his son Najib, Sino Malaysian relations and cooperation have never been better Following the global economic crisis of 2008, Najib looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented economy, emphasizing increased Chinese investment into Malaysia and expanding the base of Sino Malaysian trade in areas like education and student exchange, finance, infrastructure development, science and technology, yielding lucrative and mutually beneficial results China has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures reaching US$90 billion in 2011; Malaysia is China s largest trading partner among ASEAN nations In asking the question of regime change in Malaysia, Dr Chandra Muzaffar reflects on Washington s moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the Asia Pacific region: Establishing a military base in Darwin [Australia], resurrecting the US military alliance with the Philippines, coaxing Japan to play a more overt military role in the region, instigating Vietnam to confront China over the Spratly Islands, and encouraging India to counterbalance Chinese power, are all part and parcel of the larger US agenda of encircling and containing China In pursuing this agenda, the US wants reliable allies ì not just friends ì in Asia In this regard, Malaysia is important because of its position as a littoral state with sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, which is one of China s most critical supply routes that transports much of the oil and other materials vital for its economic development Will the containment of China lead to a situation where the hegemon, determined to perpetuate its dominant power, seek to exercise control over the Straits in order to curb China s ascendancy? Would a trusted ally in Kuala Lumpur facilitate such control? The current Malaysian leadership does not fit the bill ù Backwards and forwards Pakatan Rakyat, the main opposition coalition pitted against the ruling party, has yet to offer a fully coherent organizational program, and if the coalition ever came to power, the disunity of its component parties and their inability to agree on fundamental policies would be enough to conjure angrier, disenchanted youth back on to the streets, in larger numbers perhaps What is ticklishly ironic about reading op eds penned by the likes of Wolfowitz and Al Gore, and how they laud Malaysia as a progressive and moderate model Islamic state, is that they concurrently demonize its leadership and dismiss them authoritarian thugs Surely, the ruling coalition has its shortcomings; the politicization of race and religion, noted cases of corrupt officials squandering funds, etc ì but far too few, especially those of the middle class who benefit most from energy subsidies, acknowledge the tremendous economic growth achieved under the current leadership and the success of their populist policies Najib s administration would do well to place greater emphasis on addressing the concerns of Malaysia s minorities who view affirmative action policies given to Malay ethnicities as disproportionate; income status, not ethnicity, should be a deciding factor in who receives assistance The current administration appears set to widen populist policies that make necessities affordable through subsidies and continue to assist low income earners with cash handouts Najib has acknowledged the need for broad reforms of Malaysia s state owned enterprises over concerns that crony capitalism may deter foreign investment; this should be rolled out concurrently with programs to foster more local entrepreneurship To put it bluntly, the opposition lacks confidence from the business community and foreign investors; even the likes of JP Morgan have issued statements of concern over an opposition win It should be noted that if Islamists ever wielded greater influence in Malaysia under an opposition coalition, one could imagine a sizable exodus of non Muslim minorities and a subsequent flight of foreign capital, putting the nation s economy in a fragile and fractured state And yet, the United States has poured millions into òdemocracy promotion efforts to strengthen the influence of NGOs that distort realities and cast doubt over the government s ability to be a coherent actor Malaysia does not have the kind of instability that warrants overt external intervention; backing regime change efforts may only go so far as supporting dissidents and groups affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim No matter the result of the upcoming elections, Najib appears to have played ball enough for Washington to remain more or less neutral According to Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, Malaysia s electoral process is so restrictive that a mass movement like Bersih is required to purge the system of its backwardness These are curious statements, considering that the opposition gained control of four out of 13 states in 2008, including Selangor, a key economic state with the highest GDP and most developed infrastructure In response, Najib has adhered to Bersih s demands and has called for electoral reform, forming a parliamentary select committee comprising members from both Pakatan Rakyat and Barisan Nasional As elections loom, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenavasan is already dubbing them the dirtiest elections ever seen ù ì unsurprising rhetoric from a woman being handed her talking points by the US embassy Nile Bowie for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-regime-change-871/
"8 Sep, 2012",Police crackdown on Bahraini activists (VIDEOS),"Bahraini security forces launched tear gas and arrested activists in Manama who defied the ban on anti government demonstrations The protesters called for the release of political prisoners and reform of the nation s monarchical government Dozens of activists converged on the old quarter of the Bahraini capital as they were prevented from marching on the main road by a police blockade They chanted peaceful, peaceful! ù as they marched and demanded the release of all prisoners of conscience held by the government Some of the protesters also called for the ouster of the country s ruling monarchy Police in riot gear rounded on the demonstrators, dispersing them with stun grenades and teargas, and making a number of arrests The street demonstration follows the sentencing to life in prison of eight leaders of the country s protest movement They were found guilty of conspiring to overthrow Bahrain s Sunni Muslim monarchy Among the condemned was the founder of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, Abdulhadi al Khawaja The Bahraini government has condemned the majority Shiite protest movement as sectarian extremism Human rights groups decried the ruling, claiming that no evidence was presented to show that the defendants had perpetrated violent acts during protests Amnesty International slammed the verdict and said it demonstrated once more that the Bahraini authorities are not on the path of reform, but seem rather driven by vindictiveness Patrick Henningsen, a geopolitical analyst for the UK Column website, says that the decision for Bahraini authorities to hand down life sentences to opposition activists for sedition was part of a government led pogrom to quell any dissent whatsoever ùHowever, he believes that the very nature of the opposition movement in Bahrain will act as a barrier against radicalization No one wants to see a violent uprising; no one wants to see the sort of the violence that you see in countries like Syria But that is a different type of violence because it is being backed by the West in proxy fashion through various other countries and Gulf states, ù he said The problem with Bahrain is: this is an actual democratic movement this isn t the fake Arab Spring that you saw in Egypt that was mostly a George Soros, NGO, sort of twitter driven revolution, he continued More than 50 people have been killed since the protests began against the Bahraini government in February of last year, coinciding with the birth of the Arab Spring Shiite Muslins make up the majority of Bahrain s population and claim that they are discriminated against by the country s Sunni rulers In response to public outrage, the Sunni government pledged to implement a series of reforms that would allocate more power to the elected parliament, away from the ruling monarchy However, activists maintain the reforms will do little redistribute the balance of power in the island kingdom ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/bahrain-protest-tear-gas-652/

"16 Aug, 2011",Merkel and Sarkozy propose euro-zone ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù to tackle debt crisis,"Germany and France are calling on all euro zone members to enshrine a balanced budget in their constitution, as well proposing a collective government ù led by the EU president In one of the most dramatic expansions of state power since the onset of the EU debt crisis, France and Germany have proposed a united euro zone government to guide the bloc s finances as well as having power to overrule national governments The new collective economic government would be lead by Herman Van Rompuy and consist of heads of state or government that would meet at least twice a year We want to express our absolute will to defend the euro and assume Germany and France s particular responsibilities in Europe and to have on all of these subjects a complete unity of views, ù said Sarkozy The Franco German tandem, who represent the euro zone s two largest economies, have also proposed to unite the corporation taxes of two countries A tax on financial transactions have also been announced According to Angela Merkel this is being done in order to harmonize economies and taxes across Europe Nicholas Sarkozy faces an election next year, where he is already trailing behind his rivals, and many suspect that those announcements might make him even more unpopular in his country Opinion polls show that people in Europe do not want closer integration Merkel and Sarkozy have dismissed the use of Eurobonds, which many have said would be the solution to Eurozone s economic problems They have said that Eurobonds are not a solution, they are not a cure ù and France and Germany will not guarantee other country s debt, they refuse to bail out the rising problems in countries like Italy and Spain Meanwhile, influential investors like George Soros are supporting the Eurobonds, saying the only solution for such weak countries as Portugal and Greece is to leave the euro The problem is that Germany has already been sucked into the crisis itself with its economic growth skidding to a halt in the second three months of the year It s economy grew by just 0 1 per cent in the second quarter, while the French economy stagnated Finance professor Marco Becht from the Solvay Brussels School says that none of the proposals made today by Angela Merkel and Nikolas Sarkozy will have a positive impact on the euro zone crisis We were not surprised by anything that was said, ù he said What markets are looking for is the actual implementation of the decisions that were taken in July, which is mostly loading up the European financial stability mechanism with money, so it can become operational and purchase bonds in the secondary markets ù Meanwhile, the chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, Philippe Waechter, says that if the proposed euro zone government ù is indeed created, Europe s leading economy will have to make serious concessions Germany will not be the chief, ù he stated We will have to share all things, because we will succeed only if we all go together in the same direction ù And Scheherazade Rehman, a professor of business and international affairs at George Washington University, says the decisions taken at the meeting reflect only the political aspirations of German and French leaders, and not market demands † Unfortunately, this is not going to make much difference for the ongoing crisis, ù she told RT All the news that came out from this news conference is quite negative for the market The most negative was the fact that it was announced that the European fund for stabilization facility the bailout fund for the euro zone members will not be expanded The second thing: there is no common Eurobond that was going to be issued, and they were very clear about it and the markets were not expecting this Other bad news for the market was that taxation is going to go up ù So, the European leaders have done it again they have not really addressed the market s needs for clear concise action, but what they are doing instead is looking at the long term political solution to the dilemma that they have, ù concluded Rehman Financial writer Peter Bild argues that economically and politically, what the two leaders have done is basically the right thing, or at least a step in the right direction † There is no quick fix, ù he told RT The only quick fix is the one that the Central Bank or the stability fund that s been set up in the euro zone can possibly handle In other words, they can manipulate the market, but the essential problem is not the question of market manipulation It is fundamentally the question of the huge debts that are being run up, in some cases not even willfully but in response to a huge economic downturn, which means that countries revenues have fallen and, as things stand right now, I can t see any end to it We are seeing that all of Europe is slowing down, and that means that probably deficits will increase and not decrease ù † In the end, if you are hugely in debt, it is your creditor who tells you what you can and what you can t do, ù Bild stated Parliaments may not like it, but in the end, if the budgets are not harmonized, if they are not done in accordance with rules which limit how much debt you can run up, then of course the creditors are simply not going to give you any money Now, if you accept that you do need money, then you are also going to have to accept the rules and possibly the loss of some so called sovereignty ù ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/merkel-sarkozy-eurobonds-eu/
"15 Aug, 2011",Dining on the Euro‚Äôs near death experience,"Take a currency, one widely used as a reserve currency, including by Russia, and expose it to the blowtorch of market examination of its fundamentals It isn t pretty, and the Euro may be gone soon, if it the debt issue isn t comprehensively addressed On the Menu memories of fellow leaders pastTomorrow s meeting between Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy will go a long way to determining the future of the Euro The simple question on the menu is whether they can put together the politics to save the Euro The politics isn t easy Almost every European leader from Papandreou in Greece, to the leaders in Ireland and Portugal who have introduced austerity, before heading to the electoral dustbin barely avoiding being tarred and feathered by their not so thankful electorates, and Spain where the election has been called, through to Berlusconi in Italy where the austerity is about to unfold, has shown where the politics is profoundly difficult But the finances are equally so After the bailout of Greece (twice) Ireland and Portugal the existing EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility), which was setup with a 440 billion now needs to encompass the possibility of coming to the aid of Spain, Italy, almost certainly Cyprus (which seems to have gone under the radar, but has a banking sector far bigger than its size would indicate and is surprisingly closely tied to Russia) and maybe other needs far more Italy and Spain alone have an estimated 2 2 Trillion in outstanding debt compared to 630 billion for the nations which have already received bailouts Settling past billsThe initial EFSF is built up through loans from existing Eurozone nations, plus a dollop from the IMF The nations contributing to it included those receiving bailouts, with nearly 1/3 coming from nations which have either received bailouts, or like Italy and Spain, are in the firing line That leaves any potential expansion in the hands of the larger or more solvent players, making France and Germany the twin pillars in terms of providing for its enlargement to 2 Trillion, with the need for their contributions to an enlarged EFSF already being factored in by markets, which explains in part some of the tremors in CDS swaps across the Eurozone in recent weeks They are starting to question even the AAA rated nations of the Eurozone and the implications of what is potentially a massive additional debt servicing need by them, in order to ensure an adequate bailout for the whole Eurozone To put that in context for theses nations it tends to represent an additional 14 20% of their standing debt, or generally adding about 8% of debt to GDP to their load Then there are additional concerns with any and every potential bond purchase part of the EFSF, with questions over coupon values, durations, interest rates, and net present values, not to mention how they get accounted for by the nations receiving funds, and how the EFSF marks these to market Dealing with haughty waitersThe other key factor in the malaise is the structure of the EFSF and its management It currently revolves around sovereign debt issues if the Eurozone nations individually, and is managed by the ECB The ECB has been buying bonds of the bailed out nations, plus those, belatedly, of Spain and Italy last week, while at the same time imposing a hard core dose of austerity every time upon the nations, as the price for stepping into the market Arguments rage back and forth, but there is certainly a case for thinking that in some cases the austerity involved is not just making the life harder in these nations, but largely ensuring they will not see any real economic growth for some time, and as a result further eroding their capacity to service their existing debt Against a backdrop of the ECB widely being seen as a key factor, through tightening rates too early and too far, in turning an nascent economic recovery into a near certain recession across much of the Eurozone, that is generating plenty of tension from aggrieved politicians having to tout austerity to those who vote for them at the behest of appointed officials Silvio Berlusconi s comments about bleeding hearts and looking like an occupied government, in the wake of getting the Italian parliament to agree to austerity measures on Friday encapsulates a mood which resonates strongly in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain Palatable and unpalatableThe meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel is expected to see the French leader push for the Eurozone to issue bonds backed by all 17 member nations This would effectively entail the Eurozone developing the fiscal side critics have always maintained it lacks to go with its monetary side Supporting the contention is the fact that the need to contribute to the EFSF and its enlargement is actually corroding market confidence in the stronger nations, as seen in the market treatment of French banks and French debt in the last week That brings us back to another round of ugly politics Germans aren t terribly enthused about the prospect of bailing out their southern neighbours, and there is a constitutional challenge in Germany to the existing bailout German resistance to any form of sharing responsibility for sovereign debts of other nations is profound, with Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble stating again on the weekend that There is no collectivisation of debt or unlimited support Germans are also aware that any thought of freeing the ECB from its need to sterilize its bond purchases and head off to flood money markets while buying distressed Euro sovereign debt could be highly inflationary, and potentially destabilizing for a nation which has prided itself on rock solid finances given that it would be required to provide most of the firepower enabling it to happen The collection of centre right parties which comprise the majority in the Bundestag haven t been backward in denouncing any hint of easing up for their European neighbours, giving Chancellor Merkel precious little political leeway Dessert anyone?But writing in the Financial Times on August 14, George Soros sums up the vital role of Germany, and the need for Europe to be able to convince Germany to change its approach if the Eurozone is to survive Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany, and because eurobonds will put Germany s credit standing at risk, any compromise must put Germany in the driver s seat Sadly, Germany has unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy, and it wants Europe to follow its example But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe: no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits Germany must agree to rules by which others can also abide ùThe other side of the equation is that flooding the markets with money, would potentially generate growth in the Eurozone which would lighten the debt servicing issue for those currently looking at exporting people due to the lack of opportunities at home Currently the ECB doesn t have the scope for the scale of purchases needed, while ensuring these are sterilized So that leaves the Eurozone wondering if Sarkozy and Merkel can come to agreement on allowing the ECB to proceed with unsterilized debt purchases, agreeing to issue Eurobonds which would be heavily reliant on Germany, or if they can come up with a system or general idea which they can sell to politicians and publics across the EU that involves fiscal transfers, joint responsibility for existing debts, and will calm markets For if they come out with nothing more than glib statements, or more of the same it is a recipe for Euro and market chaos James BlakeRT Business Internet ù

"13 Jul, 2011",‚ÄúHundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis‚Äù,"The head of Russia s Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug related deaths since the beginning of this year At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses The reason for most drug related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world s third most heroin consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq Some people, such as Mr Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence For people not involved in gross drug related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0 2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan s enormous drug production As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000 kilometer border with Kazakhstan RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe Mostly it s the Netherlands, where most amphetamine based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels † Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it s nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical No, of course not We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers After all, people are not born addicted to drugs It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents That s when they get to know drugs If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No We are not talking about forced treatment here Any forced treatment is a violation of a person Therefore it s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21] They re punished, and then they re released Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment As I ve said, this is the so called alternative responsibility By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti drugs fundamental conventions RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in this commission I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US Russia Presidential Commission Mr Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we ve been discussing at various international platforms On May 10, I spoke at the G8 s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding This concept hasn t been developed yet In this context, I want to note that the former Under Secretary General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world s leading banks This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set They ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000 Now, they are planning to return these 30,000 So, in fact, nothing has changed I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference It s longer than World War II But the situation in Afghanistan hasn t improved, it has become even worse And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse It s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country So, it s a kind of closed circle In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy The operation was called Äòmashtarak which, if translated from Persian, means Äòtogether  The operation was presented as a brilliant military success Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary We ve started talking about this need at long last It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production I ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan The EU strategy matches very well a Russia drafted plan called ÄúRaduga 2 Äù to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action RT: Thank you very much for your interview VI: Thank you very much RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/hundreds-drug-money-pumped/
"24 Jun, 2009",How Western media backs the ‚Äúgreen revolution‚Äù in Iran,"It was an election that was snatched from the Iranian people or at least that s the impression being given by Western media outlets But are they telling the full story? The BBC and the Voice of America radio station have been harshly criticized by Iranian officials who accuse the broadcasters of fueling violence after the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad The European Union has rejected Iran s accusations that the Western media helped engineer post election unrest as protests in Tehran continue And US President Barack Obama has also said that Washington is not interfering in Iran s affairs While strongly condemning the actions of Tehran in curbing the protests, Obama said the United States respects the sovereignty of the country But Iranians screaming about fraud and demanding a fair election that s what most people are seeing on their TV screens Journalist Jalal Ghazi believes Ahmadinejad won the elections because the difference is 11 million and you just cannot expect 11 million votes to be forged ù So why does the American media seem to overlook that fact? As the protests continue, some experts still believe there is interference from outside of Iran A columnist and a former assistant secretary of the US Treasury in the Reagan administration, Paul Craig Roberts, says it s all part of a major destabilization plan ordered by the US The CIA has been conducting a destabilization plan within Iran for the last two years; it is well known and has been widely reported in American and British press We are seeing the fruits of an orchestrated protest that is taking place in Tehran, ùsaid Roberts The American media serves as a propaganda ministry for the government, ùhe added Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen told RT that the real story behind the media in Iran is that of instigating a green revolution ù George Bush funneled $400 million to George Soros Open Society Institute and National Endowment for Democracy (NED) institutions to influence this opposition movement against the Iranian government, ùMadsen claims Every time you hear about revolutions it is George Soros and the Open Society Institute ù Going further, Madsen argued that Yesterday, CNN really had trouble with priming itself away from the coverage of demonstration in Tehran to cover a terrible metro train accident in Washington What is the motivation for all this intense coverage by CNN, MSNBC and Fox News?

"16 Mar, 2009",'US uses Europe as a bridge-head to attack Eurasia',"The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics RT spoke to Graziani in Rome RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures It affects all levels of society In Italy we are seeing more support towards right wing anti immigration policies How can Italy and how can we all outlive the world financial crisis? Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and Japan This crisis has affected the whole world market As for Italy, the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010 Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium enterprises, there s no high concentration of industry, and therefore Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the crisis Anyway, the crisis will be very deep We ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a continental geo economic context It means that we should look for recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as Russia, China and India are going to have their part The crisis cannot be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in Brussels by the European Union only RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but still, it was among those taken hostage by it The truth has been concealed What is the real origin of the dispute? T G : The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as EU expansion into Eastern European countries These two coinciding enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close neighbourhood This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall From that moment the United States had decided to manage the whole planet They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it s known that Central Asia has huge resources of gas and oil The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its natural location, or from Moscow If we analyze the so called orangerevolution , we ll realize that behind these achievements of the so called civilsociety of Ukraine were interests coming from across the Atlantic, from Washington We mustn t also forget about the influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian republics When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo political context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it s evident that when it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other Obviously gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine s leaders lack sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests Instead of looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas designated for European nations This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press, including the Italian press In the gas dispute, the majority of Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used geo policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal economic transactions concerning gas RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year T G : I believe it s possible to find an economic agreement Moscow and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts I d like to stress again that it s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and import It s a geopolitical issue It s evident, if Ukraine chooses to set up a Western camp with Washington s leadership, that ll affect not only gas, but also other economic issues as well Hence, I believe, it ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes from Kiev, because it depends on Washington s interests RT: While we re focusing on Washington let s talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here? T G : Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but they aren t politically conscious Thus, in the case of the enlargement of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main argument was environmental And the main motive was hidden as, in reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they d have the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in Serbia, which also depends on Washington In future it ll be possible to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia The Yugoslavian nation, Serbia in this case, wasn t chosen by chance, but because it has some cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia EU relations, many EU states are already looking for alternative suppliers Does Russia need to worry? T G : No, I don t think Russia should worry about it I think every country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning energy supplies and be self sufficient In a wider geo political context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe, between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests: exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources and, obviously, cultural relations I believe cultural relations between the European Union and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture If we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the 1930s we ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect language with many borrowed English words It is a result of cultural colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until today It s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in the countries of the former Soviet block RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia EU relations? T G : Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the European Union is a potential partner of I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London RT: You re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world anymore T G : I m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge head to attack the whole Eurasian ground It makes me critical, but, of course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over At present, in the 21st century, on a geo political level we have a multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some states in South America, which are also creating their own geo political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too In particular, major liberties which these South American countries enjoy can allow the European Union to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain RT: You travel all over Europe s hotspots and breakaway regions You were monitoring the election in Transdniester There is an island off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that s just declared independence, they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia Is there one universal formula on how to deal with separatism? T G : These issues are absolutely different In Sardinia there is a political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now As for Transdniester, it s necessary to view its situation from the geo strategic point of view The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel the weight of the United States and NATO Transdniester is one of the so called frozen conflicts I think Transdniester s independence would be interesting, because in this case it ll become an area the United States won t be able to enter It ll be a territory of liberty from the Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its sovereignty I don t analyze this republic judging it by its actual government I only analyze its geo strategic and geo political situation Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its small territory there are no NATO bases RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005‚Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/us-uses-europe-as-a-bridge-head-to-attack-eurasia/
