"25 Oct, 2019",George Soros says all his ‚Äòenemies‚Äô are wannabe dictators as he drops unprecedented wads of lobbying cash,"In the world of billionaire financier George Soros, his critics are would be dictators ù who will not succeed Meanwhile, under Trump, the opensociety founder has been pouring greater sums into lobbying than ever before I m very proud of the enemies I have, ù he told the New York Times in an interview published Friday, in which he confidently predicted the popular opposition to his globalist philosophy was winding down and that a backlash against Trump style nationalism was on the horizon It s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would be dictator, if he identifies me as an enemy Soros slammed the US president as an aberration, ùpredicting what he has done in the Middle East ù clearing troops from the Turkish Syrian border, allowing peace to break out with a deal between Russia and Turkey will contribute to his demise next year ù Trump has called out Soros in the past, accusing him of paying the protesters who swarmed the Capitol over Justice Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court and hinting that he was bankrolling the migrant caravans that swarmed the US southern border last year Soros is a popular villain among conservatives, who suspect that, after funding colorrevolution s in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, he is trying to start one in the US The currency speculation that has made him enemies from Malaysia to Britain has also made him rich enough to contribute billions toward funding what are usually described as progressive causes ù through his opensociety Foundations And he is spending more than ever on those causes, dumping some $15 9 million to influence Congress in just the third quarter of 2019 via his foundation s lobbying division, the opensociety Policy Center, according to a recent filing It s a jump even over the group s 2018 expenditures, which, at $31 5 million, made it the third largest lobbying group that year Only the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors outspent the billionaire Aside from lobbying, Soros spreads his money around liberally in more ways than one He has funded media organizations like Democracy Now! and Media Matters, pro immigration groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Migration Policy Institute, think tanks like the Aspen Institute and the Center for American Progress, fundraising organizations like MoveOn org that stages anti Trump protests, and interventionist policy groups like the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect He has already donated millions to the democraticparty for 2020 There are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets, ù he said, calling Elizabeth Warren who wants to tax the wealthy heavily the most qualified person to be president Soros also has a mortal enemy China, † the nation that fought a winning battle against his currency speculating in 1998, so now he calls Xi Jinping s China the worst threat to an opensociety ù Given what has happened to the other societies Soros has poured money into, Xi might take that as a compliment     ",https://www.rt.com/usa/471880-soros-enemies-dictators-lobbying-china/
"10 Oct, 2019",Who are Extinction Rebellion ‚Äî the ‚Äòeco-activists‚Äô grounding planes & shutting down cities,"Calling for civil disobedience in the face of climate change, Extinction Rebellion protesters have been remarkably successful in thrusting themselves into the headlines But what is the movement all about? And who s behind it? Best known for shutting down the streets of London in April, Extinction Rebellion upped its game on Thursday, with a protester affiliated with the group grounding an Aer Lingus flight from London City Airport to Dublin Another protester Paralympian James Brown clambered onto the roof of a British Airways plane and refused to budge, prompting police to eventually remove him Just about to take from London city airport Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protestor #londoncityairport#ClimateChangepic twitter com/eWBeeUiGHM The disruptions came as Extinction Rebellion threatened a Hong Kong style ùoccupation and shutdown of the airport, and as similar protests hit more than 60 cities worldwide Ultimately, it is part of Extinction Rebellion s aim to get people arrested, ùread a flyer circulated by activists in Dublin To that end, the group has been successful More than 1,000 activists have been arrested in London alone this week, including 50 at London City Airport The group sdemandsare threefold First, they call on governments to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, ùa similar demand to that made by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York last month A seemingly benign demand, but one that paints opponents as anti truth Secondly, they demand that government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 ùFinally, the group demands that government partner up with activists, and create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens Assembly on climate and ecological justice ù While a Citizens Assembly would draw on a cross section of society, it would be government created and guided by a collection of NGOs and academics, as was the case in Ireland when the government convened such an assembly to pave the way for referenda on gay marriage and abortion in recent years Extinction Rebellion make no mention on whether NGOs with opposing views will be included in the deliberation At XR s rallies, protesters have called for any number of ways of meeting these goals and more, including government bans on meat and private cars, abolishment of the airplane, boycotts of the fashion industry, and disbandment of the military Disrupting commerce is fair game for making their points, as is disrupting vital services As a cancer patient in London was forced towalkto hospital treatment due to XR s roadblocks, spokesperson Savannah Lovelock told Sky News that while she was really sorry, ùsuch action is necessary for the good of the planet Central to all of the group s demands is a radical expansion of state power Reducing greenhouse gases to net zero if a state led effort would give government the power to restrict or outright deny its citizens freedom of travel, freedom to choose their own diets, and freedom to build their homes however they want In the US,drafttextof Green New Deal legislation gives a sneak peek at just how all encompassing this would be, working wealth redistribution and reparations for historic oppression ùinto the mix for good measure A potent illustration of the group s appeal to authority came last November, when XR co founder Gail Bradbrook marched on Buckingham Palace and read aloud amessageto Queen Elizabeth with great humility, ùcalling on the monarch to save the planet by royal decree It isn t enough to live a life of voluntary simplicity, ùacademic and XR campaigner Rupert Read wrote at the time The implied meaning is clear: people will have to be coerced into complying Here s where things get interesting Exploding onto the scene with a recognizable logo, coherent imagery across multiple continents, a dominant social media presence and a slick website, the leaders of Extinction Rebellion are no rabble of bong smoking malcontents Especially not Dr Gail Bradbrook The co founder of the movement told the BBC that she came up with the idea after praying in a deep way ùwhile under the influence of psychedelic medicines ùon a retreat last year In truth, Bradbrook has made a career out of activism, and has for two decades worked as a professional campaigner Speaking at a talk in 2016, sheadmittedthat this role is mostly about securing your own paycheck ùAs director of Citizens Online a charity campaigning for digital inclusion, ùBradbrook has worked with BT to lobby the British government Joining Bradshaw are former organic farmer Roger Hallam, and also involved are Occupy London veteran Tasmin Osmond a granddaughter of British nobility and ex UN worker Laura Reeves Behind the movement is a bulwark of elite cash Heiress Aileen Getty has kicked in nearly 500,000 of her family s oil wealth to the group via the Climate Emergency Fund, claiming that disruption ùis necessary to take on climate change According to its own data, Extinction Rebellion has raised just short of a million pounds in largedonationssince March, from groups like the Children s Investment Fund Foundation, set up by a hedge fund manager and run by a former vice chairman of billionaire financier George Soros opensociety Institute Aside from annoying motorists and boosting superglue sales, Extinction Rebellion has achieved some of its aims Eleven countries and dependencies, beginning with Britain and Ireland, have declared a state of climate emergency, ùeven if Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar did say afterwards that the declaration was a symbolic gesture ù What Extinction Rebellion has also been successful in is pandering to the wishes of global financiers and the new captains of green industry The group s call for net zero ùcarbon emissions is echoed by the World Bank, and a host ofinvestment firms, including HSBC, JP Morgan Chase and Citi, that see profits to be had ùin climate related sectors ù None of this is a bad thing on the surface, except that these groups which have banded together to form the Climate Finance Partnership and Blended Finance Action Taskforce want access to taxpayer money and pension funds to do this This Western money, according to the groups, will be funnelled into projects in Africa, Asia, and South America Rarely do the demands of activists and the will of international finance line up, but not everyone is happy In London, Police Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has warned that the current protests will hamper officers ability to tackle street based violence, ùand leave the city more vulnerable to terrorism Street blockages and airport disruptions may put Extinction Rebellion at odds with the majority of the population, but majority support is unnecessary XR co founder Roger Hallam has repeatedlyreferencedGene Sharp as an inspiration An American political scientist, Sharp s theory of nonviolent action that only 3 5 percent of a population need to back a protest movement before it reaches critical mass and triggers change has been adopted and put into practice by colorrevolution aries around the world, from US sponsored student protesters inSerbiaat the turn of the century, to Arab Spring revolutionaries more recently Celebrities have lined up to endorse Extinction Rebellion from gloom rockers Radiohead chipping in 300,000 to Benedict Cumberbatch joining protesters camped in Trafalgar Square With elite cash and backing, as well as round the clock media coverage, Extinction Rebellion is well on its way to Sharp s tipping point, and has well and truly glued itself to the public consciousness already  ",https://www.rt.com/news/470647-who-are-extinction-rebellion/

"19 Feb, 2019",NATO‚Äôs Atlantic Council hijacks Munich conference with revisionist ‚Äòprinciples‚Äô declaration,"Taking over the annual Munich security conference, the Atlantic Council has come out with a declaration of principles that seeks to legitimize the rogue behavior of the West after the Cold War as a rules based world order For almost three decades now, Washington and its numerous clients and allies have insisted they were only upholding a rules based international order ùagainst those who seek to challenge it, be it rogue states ùsuch as North Korea and Iran or great powers such as Russia and China In the process, this self styled international community ùtrampled actual rules and laws to sanction, bomb, invade, occupy and regime change countries that stood in its way while claiming to be acting in the interests of the peace, democracy and commerce Back in 2007, Russian President VladimirPutin stood upat the Munich Security Conference in Germany and denounced this behavior, arguing that the US has overstepped its national borders in every way, ùimposing economic, political, cultural and educational policies ùon other nations while holding itself exempt from any rules and limitations This past weekend, the Atlantic Council a think tank backed by the US, NATO and other allied governments used the platform of the Munich conference to announce a declaration of principles ùthat explicitly seeks to revise the international order along the very lines Putin criticized, essentially establishing its signatories as the judge, jury and executioner of international law as they write it üö®BREAKING NEWS: Former leading officials from democratic countries have come together to declare their intent to defend a rules based order Here is the full set of principles #DefendDemocracy#ACDeclaration#MSC2019Read:https:// tdotco /JOy6l14nSnpic twitter com/GjFcp4nhcP In the words ofJohn Bellinger, one of the declaration s authors, it was loosely modeled on the Atlantic Charter, ùthe WWII era document establishing the US UK alliance Yet the new document has far more in common with the goals of Germany, Italy and Japan in that it is explicitly revisionist, saying: We will seek to revise and strengthen the international system to reflect these principles and advance them on the basis of international law Those undersigned are endorsing a standing mechanism ùthat would track compliance ùwith the principles outlined in the declaration and urge our governments to act when these principles are violated ù Wasn t that supposed to be the job of the United Nations? And how is it respectful of others freedom and sovereignty to impose values on them at gunpoint? The declaration creates more questions than it purports to answer The seven point platform pays lip service to freedom and justice, democracy and self determination, peace and security, free markets and equal opportunity ùIt also demands of signatories to support an open global economy ù Point Four somehow managed to advocate for private property and capitalism as well as welfare state and open borders, asserting the right to own property, purchase goods and services, and invest in free and open markets ùas well as free and fair flow of trade and investment ù but also demanding of governments to facilitate access to food, water, shelter, medical services, and educationfor their own citizens and others in need ù(emphasis added) Point Five also talks about an open and healthy planet ùin vague terms that combine overarching global environmentalism and migration across only nominally controlled borders The true gem is Point Six, the right of assistance ùthat would require governments to allow their citizens to receive assistance from others to advance these principles, including, in non free societies, support to non violent groups, political parties, and individuals aiming to foster democracy or human rights ùbut also the signatories to intervene where governments or other actors are unwilling or unable to cease or remedy flagrant or systematic violations ù Who would define non free societies ù?

"14 Feb, 2019","Europe banked on George Soros instead of Viktor Orban, and will suffer the consequences ‚Äì forever","A clash of ideas is occurring in Europe between Hungarian PM Viktor Orban and financier George Soros that will impact the continent forever But Brussels is only interested in considering one option the Soros option Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In any other period of European history, Viktor Orban would have been heralded as a noble statesman by many of his peers The reason is rather straightforward He is attempting to do exactly what other European leaders have done for centuries before him, and that is defending the continent from foreign incursions But these are radical new times and the old rules no longer apply By now, most people are familiar with the mainstream media s narrative on Europe s plight Millions of desperate migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, suffering the untold ravages of war and poverty, are streaming towards Europe s borders in a quest for some semblance of peace and happiness There is a lot of truth to that narrative; millions of innocent people have had their lives totally upended by senseless wars sparked by Western regime change operations They deserve not only sympathy but physical assistance At the same time, however, Europeans are expected to sacrifice everything to assist these new arrivals regardless of the cost And the cost is nothing less than exorbitant InGermany, for example, asylum seekers are entitled to as much as 354 ($400) per month, while the state picks up the tab for rent and medical insurance All told, Germany isexpectedto fork out hold onto your hat 77 6 billion ($86 2 billion) during the period from 2017 to 2020 on feeding, housing and training their new guests In light of that massive assistance, is it any wonder that over one million people crashed Germany s paper border in 2015 alone? This leads us to an obvious question that the Western media never discusses: Would this great migration of people have occurred without the promise of generous handouts by European capitals? It seems that without some sort of security net in place, the majority of these people would not have risked such ahazardousjourney Moreover, there are huge budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored (yet are), for as any economist knows, money does not grow on trees This is Sweden Around 15 cars were set on fire in the city of G√§vle tonight 5 women sexually assaulted in Uppsala this weekend Also, there was 4 bombings in 24 hours This is not the Sweden I used to knowüò≠pic twitter com/f1Oqfr0YYT George Soros, the head of opensociety Foundations, believes he has that problem figured out To finance it, heexplainedcasually, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later Really? Well, judging by the Yellow Vest protests occurring on a weekly basis in the French capital, initially sparked by the imposition of a new fuel tax, we have some good indication as to how enthusiastic Europeans will be for such a plan In short, not very The questions don t end there How is it possible that George Soros has been able to sell his unproven and very expensive plan for open borders to the European people? We can take some guidance from the pithy expression Money talks In that case, nobody has done more talking in Europe than Soros Over the years, the billionaire has assembled some 226 reliableallies in the European Parliament to promote his vision of a brave new Europe This cozy arrangement allowed his opensociety European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of opensociety Foundations, tomeetwith members of the European Commission on 65 separate occasions last year alone It s probably safe to say that those closed door meetings had no small impact on the political landscape of Europe Enter Viktor Orban, the bane of Brussels, who is playing a role in European history that cannot be overestimated The leader of fiercely independent Hungary has taken a zero tolerance approach to illegal immigration,refusingto permit a single illegal immigrant to enter his country Meanwhile, other eastern European countries Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which, together with Hungary, form the anti immigration Visegrad Group have takensimilarsteps At the same time, across Europe right wing parties aresurgingin popularity In direct defiance of Brussels, Orban has ordered the construction of a barbed wire fence that runs along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia, a project that the mainstream media somehowconflateswith authoritarianism, as if the concept of national borders never existed before in history OrbansentBrussels a bill for half the cost of the fence, but it was never paid, of course That s too bad, because it could have been the smartest money the EU ever spent, since it would have spared Europeans the influx of mass illegal immigration The Hungarian leader has other ideas that Brussels will probably not be considering any time soon, like ways of addressing Europe s dire demographic problem This month, Orban announced a raft of new tax and loan incentives for families as part of government efforts to boost the birth rate without depending on immigration flows to accomplish that goal There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration, hesaidin his annual state of the nation speech We need Hungarian children The plan has some merit Mothers will be eligible for a 10 million forint ($36,000) subsidized loan, he explained One third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born, and the entire loan waived after a third child is born Now compare Orban s plan with that of the Hungarian born George Soros, who somehow believes that maintaining strong national borders will fragment the union Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union, he wrote in Foreign Policy [T]hey also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards Building on that crooked foundation, SorosadvisedEuropean lawmakers back in 2016 that the EU should spend 30 billion ($34 billion) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year We already know who will be forced to pick up the tab on that massive expenditure, and it s not George Soros One reason that Soros and his 226 reliable allies support the influx of migrants into Europe is they believe it will somehow offset the continent s demographic and labor shortage The latter part of that plan has already been proven a disaster An OECD reportfoundthat less than 40 percent of immigrants had completed an upper secondary school education or higher, while another studyshowedthat only eight percent of asylum seekers were hired by companies as skilled workers Despite clear signs that George Soros grand plans for the europeanunion are an utter failure, Brussels continues to heed his every word, while at the same time taking steps topunishOrban Just this week, Soroswarned, with no loss of irony, that if Europe doesn t wake up it will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991 The financier fretted over the rise of far right parties in Europe, which he believes will enjoy a competitive advantage in parliamentary elections in May Yes, that is a very big possibility Not once did he suggest, however, that just maybe his grand idea of open borders, made all the more tempting with cash enticements, might just have contributed to that radical disequilibrium of which he spoke If Europe is one day visited by the ghost of its fascist past, George Soros will only have himself to blame Influential people like Soros would have made a far greater impact had they advocated on behalf of peace in the Middle East and North Africa, speaking out on US led interventionist wars that have prompted millions of innocent people to flee their homes Innocent people from war torn countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria deserve the same rights to peace and happiness without having to travel thousands of miles away from home to find it which ironically leads them directly into the homelands of the people who invaded them in the first place! In conclusion, it is highly disturbing that Brussels is willing to give so much credence to a billionaire financier with questionable motives for opening Europe s floodgates to illegal immigration, while vilifying a democratically elected European head of state for attempting to exert some kind of order on a situation that is clearly way out of control @Robert_Bridge Think your friends would be interested?

"4 Feb, 2019","Happy Birthday, Facebook! A short history of the social network‚Äôs biggest gaffes","Facebook turns 15 today and to reflect on how the world has changed since Mark Zuckerberg first dreamt up what would become a scandal plagued global behemoth, RT looks back at some of its biggest controversies Zuckerberg s questionable †moves first came to light back in 2004 when he brutally cut his co founder Eduardo Saverin out of the picture in a shady move that saw him set up a new company in order to absorb the original, drastically diluting Saverin s shares The sneaky move was made just months after the social network launched and Zuckerberg soon faced lawsuits from Saverin and fellow Harvard students Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who claimed Zuckerberg stole their concept for the platform Zuckerberg settled and gave the brothers $20 million, plus Facebook shares The Winklevoss used a fraction of that payout to invest in Bitcoin and are now billionaires Facebook launched Beacon in 2007 as an advertising system which sent data from partner websites back to Facebook for targeted advertising These websites were able to publish information about Facebook users activities on their news feeds, leading to some sticky situations for users, such as people who were having affairs being exposed A class action suit followed and Beacon was eventually shut down in 2009 In October 2010, the Wall Street Journal revealed that 10 of Facebook s most popular apps like FarmVille had access to users identity numbers that allowed them to track them and their online habits, no matter what privacy settings the users had set The apps were also able to track app users friends, and some of these app companies then spread Facebook user data to other companies Zuckerberg frames his empire as a force for good in the world, and Facebook s Free Basics project offering free internet to people around the world was touted as a noble way to get the globe online when it was launched as Internet org in 2013 However, it wasn t long before it emerged that the free internet project was extremely limited as in, just to Facebook and a selection of the internet determined by the social network The company was accused of digital colonialism and sparked outrage in the countries it said it was helping The early push for the project wasn t helped by the fact that one of its key satellites blew up in a SpaceX shuttle launch disaster in 2016 Facebook recently rolled out its Express Wi Fi initiative in Ghana, and has quietly expanded Free Basics to Laos and Morocco In 2012 Facebook thought it would be a cool idea to carry out an experiment to see how it could affect its users emotions by manipulating their news feeds Nearly 700,000 users were unsuspecting guinea pigs and their timelines were changed to increase positive or negative content without their knowledge or explicit consent The results were published in a report entitled Experimental evidence of massive scale emotional contagion through social networks and was slammed by researchers and academics who said consent is a key part of such research and Facebook was breaching research ethics Facebook s Trending Topics news section was exposed as being biased in 2016 after former employees revealed how the company curated the feed with topics that weren t in fact trending, and alleged conservative media outlets were deliberately suppressed This contradicted Facebook s earlier claims that the curation was done by algorithms and showed human intervention and therefore editorial decisions at almost every stage ù of the process The section was shuttered in 2018, and Facebook introduced fake news fighting partnership with the Atlantic Council and media outlets to rank news items by their trustworthiness Facebook Live gave the company serious headaches when people started broadcasting themselves engaged in controversial acts after it was rolled out in early 2016 Murders, suicides, and acts of torture were shared on the site, drawing widespread condemnation and alarm The broadcasts included a 74 year old named Robert Godwin Sr being fatally shot at point blank range, and a man in Thailand who hung his 11 month old before killing himself in a gruesome live stream Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal was one of its biggest and arguably still rocks the company It emerged in 2018 that the political consulting firm possessed data on 87 million Facebook users, which was gathered through an app posing as a personality quiz The app then harvested participants data, along with information on their Facebook friends and this was shared with Cambridge Analytica, who in turn used the data to target political ads during elections in the US and elsewhere In March 2018 the United Nations highlighted Facebook s role in the slaughter of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar The social network is accused of allowing fake news to spread about the Rohingya, which contributed to the violence A New York Timesreporton Facebook s internal affairs revealed the mess taking place behind the scenes as Facebook weathered an array of recent scandals Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg didn t come off well in the report, with both accused of handing off responsibility to subordinates in times of crisis and ignoring massive warning signs in favor of pursuing growth The biggest doozy was the revelation that Facebook employees

"29 Dec, 2018",Soros 'person of the year' indeed: In 2018 globalists pushed peoples‚Äô patience to the edge,"Since 2015, the proponents of neoliberalism have been pushing ahead with their plans for open borders and globalist agenda without the consent of the people The last 365 days saw that destructive agenda greatly challenged Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In light of the epic events that shaped our world in 2018, it seems the Yellow Vests the thousands of French citizens who took to the streets of Paris toprotestausterity and the rise of inequality would have been a nice choice for the Financial Times person of the year award Instead, that title wasbestowedupon the billionaire globalist, George Soros, who has arguably done moremeddlingin the affairs of modern democratic states than any other person on the planet Perhaps FT s controversial nomination was an attempt to rally the forces of neoliberalism at a time when populism and nascent nationalism is sweeping the planet Indeed, the shocking images coming out of France provide a grim wake up call as to where we may be heading if the globalists continue to undermine the power of the nation state It is no secret that neoliberalism relentlessly pursues a globalized, borderless world where labor, products, and services obey the hidden hand of the free market What is less often mentioned, however, is that this system is far more concerned with promoting the well being of corporations and cowboy capitalists than assisting the average person on the street Indeed, many of the world s most powerful companies today havemutatedinto stateless superpowers, ù while consumers are forced to endure crippling austerity measures amidplummetingstandards of living The year 2018 could be seen as the tipping point when the grass roots movement against these dire conditions took off Since 2015, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants into Germany and the EU, a groundswell of animosity has been steadily building against the europeanunion , perhaps best exemplified by the Brexit movement Quite simply, many people are growing weary of the globalistargumentthat Europe needs migrants and austerity measures to keep the wheels of the economy spinning At the very least, luring migrants withcash incentivesto move to Germany andelsewherein the EU appears incredibly shortsighted Indeed, if the globalist George Soros wants to lend hisMidas touchto ameliorating the migrant s plight, why does he think that relocating them to European countries is the solution? As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his opensociety Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East? Soros has an answer for that as well He calls it surge funding, ù which entails raising a substantial amount of debt backed by the EU s relatively small budget ù George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Any guesses who will be forced to pay down the debt on this high risk venture? If you guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the europeanunion , is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

"12 Nov, 2018","Criminal war, poverty at the heart of European & US migration turmoil","Europe has certainly adopted more fortress like controls against would be refugees A concomitant rise in anti immigrant political parties has in turn fueled popular resentment towards EU institutions is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others But the debate requires much more than moral appeals ù A recentstudyentitled Building Walls puts the growth of EU internal and external border barriers into stark perspective In the 1990s, there were two border walls Now the number has grown to a total of 17, with most of the structures built over the past three years Ten countries out of 28 EU member states have built physical barriers to control migrants entering from outside the bloc They include Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Latvia The authors of the above report call the structures edifices of fear ù and make the startling comparison to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany until its dismantlement in 1989 EU states have built border barriers equivalent to the length of six Berlin Walls The report also reproaches the proliferation of mental walls ù across EU member states with the rise of what it calls far right ù and racist ù political parties There are now, it is claimed, 10 EU states in which xenophobic ù parties have significant government or parliamentary representation However, the problem with a report like this is that it provides no practical solutions to the immense political and social challenges stemming from phenomenal migration The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that a record number of 68 5 million people worldwide are forcibly on the move from their origins, many of them trying to reach Europe We can perhaps agree that in recent years that the EU has faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them Think your friends would be interested?

"28 Oct, 2018","Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek: Until the rich world thinks 'one world,' migration will intensify","The rich world urgently needs to address the reasons behind mass migration, rather than its symptoms And understand we live in one world is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London Migration is, once again, headline news Columns of migrants from Honduras are approaching the US border through Mexico; African migrants broke through barriers and entered the small Spanish exclave on the northern tip of Africa; Middle East migrants are trying to enter Croatia Although the numbers are comparatively small, they do signal a basic geopolitical fact In his World Interior of Capital, the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk demonstrates how, thanks to globalization, the capitalist system came to determine all conditions of life The first sign of this development was the Crystal Palace in London, the site of the first world exhibition in 1851 Its structure rendered palpable the exclusivity of globalization as the construction and expansion of a world interior whose boundaries are invisible, yet virtually insurmountable from without, and which is now inhabited the by one and a half billion winners of globalization However, three times this number are left standing outside the door Consequently, the world interior of capital is not an agora or a trade fair beneath the open sky, but rather a hothouse that has drawn inwards everything that was once on the outside This interior, built on capitalist excesses, determines everything: The primary fact of the Modern Age was not that the earth goes around the sun, but that money goes around the earth After the process that transformed the world into the globe, social life could only take place in an expanded interior, a domestically and artificially climatized inner space What Sloterdijk correctly pointed out is that capitalist globalization does not stand only for openness & conquest, but also for a self enclosed globe separating the inside from its outside The two aspects are inseparable: capitalism s global reach is grounded in the way it introduces a radical class division across the entire globe, separating those protected by the sphere from those outside its cover The flow of refugees is a momentary reminder of the violent world outside our Cupola, a world which, for us, insiders, appears mostly on TV reports about distant violent countries, not as part of our reality but encroaching on it Thus, our ethical political duty is not just to become aware of the reality outside our Cupola, but to fully assume our co responsibility for the horrors outside our Cupola The hypocrisy of the reactions to the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi provides a nice example of how this Cupola works In a broader sense, he was one of us, well located within the Cupola, so we are shocked and outraged But our care is ridiculously displaced care: the true scandal that the Istanbul murder caused a much greater scandal than Yemen where Saudi Arabia is destroying an entire country In (probably) ordering the murder, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) forgot the lesson of Stalin: if you kill one person, you are a criminal; if you kill thousands, you are a hero So MBS should have gone on killing thousands in Yemen So, back to our Leninist question: what is to be done? The first and (sadly) predominant reaction is the one of protective self enclosure: the world out there is in a mess, let s protect ourselves by all kinds of walls A New World Order is emerging in which the only alternative to the clash of civilizations remains the peaceful coexistence of civilizations (or of ways of life, a more popular term today): forced marriages and homophobia (or the idea that a woman going alone to a public place calls for rape) are OK, just that they are limited to another country which is otherwise fully included in the world market The sad truth that sustains this new tolerance is that today s global capitalism can no longer afford a positive vision of emancipated humanity, even as an ideological dream Fukuyamaist liberal democratic universalism failed because of its own immanent limitations and inconsistencies, and populism is the symptom of this failure, its Huntington s disease But the solution is not populist nationalism, Rightist or Leftist Instead, the only cure is a new universalism it is demanded by the problems humanity is confronting today, from ecological threats to refugee crises The second reaction is global capitalism with a human face personified in socially responsible corporate figures like Bill Gates and George Soros Even in its extreme form open up our borders to the refugees, treat them like one of us Yet, the problem with this solution is that it only provides what in medicine is called a symptomatic treatment a therapy of a disease leaves the basic global situation intact; it only affects its symptoms, not its cause Such a treatment is aimed at reducing the signs and symptoms for the comfort and well being of the patient but, in our case, this is obviously not enough since the solution is obviously not that all wretched of the world will move into the safety of the Cupola We need to move from the humanitarian focus on the wretched of the Earth to the wretched Earth itself The third reaction is therefore to gather the courage and envisage a radical change which imposes itself when we fully assume the consequences of the fact that we live in ONE world Is such a change a utopia? No, the true utopia is that we can survive without such a revolution Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!   ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442485-migrants-poverty-rich-zizek/

what one might someday recognize as Orwell s Ministry of Truth Recent events over past months have caused many to suspect the reliability of news and information provided to us, often by our own governments Alternative news sources threaten to disrupt the message or narrative crafted by governments and large organizations The US Global Engagement Center is mobilizing in response to counter alternative media, conflicting perspectives and foreign influence such as Russian Propaganda The rush to judgement, complete failure to follow international norms, and subsequent actions in response to both the alleged poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in the UK and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria leaves many questions unanswered That narratives of government officials and mainstream media (MSM) are in lockstep despite the lack of any real evidence makes one suspicious of the ultimate objectives Whatever these objectives may be, they certainly appear misplaced and bring increased international tension Both these instances have the appearance of false flag operations However, despite the lack of a thorough investigation, British Prime Minister May was quick to state the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent, Novichok, and claimed it was highly likely ù that it was the Russian government behind the attack †Both the UK and Russia are signatories of the internationalChemical Weapons Convention There are setproceduresto be followed in the event of the suspected use of chemical weapons, such as Novichok, which include notification of the OPCW, cooperation of state parties and the instigation of a fact finding investigation These procedures were not followed and, in fact, Russia has yet to be included in the investigation or even provided samples There seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding so many aspects of the entire incident Despite the lack of evidence and the fragmentation of the initial storyline, the Skripal poisoning served certain interests by diverting attention away from the UK government and toward Russia The subsequent mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK, US and EU countries caused the further deterioration of international relations Throughout this period, MSM toed the party line and lately it appears to have gone silent Closely following the Skripals poisoning, surprise surprise, the famed White Helmets released a video of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria †Once again, despite no evidence and prior to the arrival of OPCW inspectors, the US, UK, and France launched airstrikes against Syria, targeting supposed chemical weapons facilities There has yet to be any indication that a chemical weapons attack actually took place †Local citizens and doctors have testified recently that there was no chemical attack and that the incident was staged Once again, MSM fails to cover the inconsistencies of the story which call in to serious question the actual occurrence of the attack Information from MSM sources, for the most part, is completely in compliance with information either being filtered or suppressed to support the desired narrative The

propaganda and disinformation efforts ùthat threaten US national security interests as well as security interests of US allies and partner countries This significantly changes the GEC s role from one of counterterrorism to one of countering foreign communications per se Moreover, it provides the new GEC with significant resource authorizations well beyond those previously provided Along with the significant expanded mission area and increased authority, the GEC will receive substantially greater funding and will include direct funding from Congress as well as authority for an additional $60 million to be transferred from the Department of Defense The GEC expansion of responsibilities is a result of the challenges of articulating a consistent message and to counter alternative information and perspectives Legislation seeks to strengthen the GEC in order to counter foreign influence, primarily Russian and Chinese disinformation efforts This evolution of the GEC is not without challenges Earlier versions of the GEC were underfunded and undermanned †The legislation and subsequent mission shift has been given to an organization operating with a focused mission to counter primarily extremist terrorism and ill prepared to counter global information flows with varying perspectives For instance, based on theNew York Times, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department s Global Engagement Center which has been tasked with countering Moscow s disinformation campaign speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts ùAs implied byVanity Fair, resource challenges, a changing mission, new technology, organizational confusion, and leadership uncertainty have contributed to the questionable performance and future of the GEC †Yet, the NDAA 2017, as well as more recent emphasis fromCongress, provide the clear intent from Congress for the increased global role of the GEC, along with the authority and resources to support it This, along with the recent confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new GEC leadership, may see the GEC rapidly evolve to complete its transformation and become the master of information Congressional pressure on technology companies, specifically social media organizations, throughout the evidence free Russiagate hearings has contributed to filtering what and how we access information †Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been grilled in hearings and are taking steps to control the flow of information Facebook has engaged fact checkers to verify information One wonders who checks the fact checkers? †Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google have also developed filters and Trust Indicators to prioritize what is seen, or not seen, and how, byusers This is done in the name of combating fake news or countering alleged Russian propaganda These actions, as well asdemonetizingsites, controlling advertising (RT and Sputnik advertising banned on Twitter), censoring information (SouthfrontandVeterans Today),de ranking as with RT, or cancelling and suspending accounts (SyrianGirl banned on Facebook and YouTube) directly influence one s access to information, essentially censoring for the good of the public Censorship and disinformation infringes on our ability to access factual information, to form our own judgements, to enlighten ourselves to differing perspectives †It essentially acts to shape our perspectives to preconceived narratives that may be counter to our own underlying values It is a realization of George Orwell s Newspeak †It is a direct attack on the most fundamental right of a free and opensociety the right of free speech †We have been gradually witnessing the erosion of the underlying principles of democracy The threat is not from any foreign power, it s from within Where are we going as a country? †Are we reincarnating McCarthyism? †Are we nurturing an Orwellian

The US has always wanted Britain to stay in the EU In April 2016, two months before the Referendum, President Obama made it clear what he wanted when he visited the UK He warned that if Britain exited the EU it would be at the back of the queue ùfor trade deals with theUS Just imagine if Putin had said that The Russophobes would have spontaneously combusted Then of course there was the backing the Remain camp had from the giants of US capital Goldman Sachsand JP Morgan donated 500,000 each to the Britain Stronger in Europe group, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley 250,000 each Again, repeat after me (with robotic arm movements): This is not foreign interference This is not foreign interference! ù You ve got to see the funny side of this: all that hysterical fake news about Russian interference in Brexit & here we have one side receiving 400K from a US billionaire who is part of the US political establishment Is that not interference ?!!https:// tdotco /URzrB3ciLd The point is not whether we are for or against Brexit Or whether we think George Soros is a malign influence who only acts out of self interest or an old sweetie pie with the good of humanity at heart The point is the double standards that are causing our Hypocrisy Detectors to explode Let s think back to December 2016 Then, the pro war and fiercely anti Russian Labour MP Ben Bradshaw told Parliament that it was highly probable ùthat Russia had interfered with Brexit Fourteen months on, what have we got? On Thursday, the global head of You Tube s public policy, Juniper Downs, said her company had conducted a thorough investigation around the Brexit referendum and found no evidence ofRussian interference ù Twitter meanwhile says it detected 49 (yes, 49) accounts from what it claimed to be a Russian troll factory, ùwhich sent all of 942 messages about Brexit amounting to less than 0 005% of all the tweets about the Referendum Twitter said the accounts received very low levels of engagement ùfrom users If the Kremlin had planned to use tweets to persuade us to vote leave, they didn t really put much effort into it, did they?

You might have thought, given his concern with foreign interference in British politics, that Ben Bradshaw would have been urging Best for Britain to return George Soros donation Au contraire!

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// tdotco /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director Michael Morrell Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who recently announced he was partially abandoning his Russian scholarship and has lost interest in maintaining my (sic) ability to speak/write Russian ù is another team member Im also done doing research about Russia for now Russian politics is not so interesting these days I have lots of other academic interests (Ill remain

invented himself as a network TV personality since 2016 with 280,000 Twitter followers, 106,000 of which are fake, according toTwitter audit Who pays for it?USAID are big backers, throwing in a seven figure annual sum This, of course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don t agree with their government s policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad s government as well as Iranian and Russian influence pic twitter com/nmSTkSzb5G Who are its people?Kimberly Kagan is the brains behind this operation She s married to Frederick Kagan, who was involved in the neocon Project for the New American Century group along with his brother, Robert Kagan Which makes Kimberly the sister in law of Victoria f**k the EU ùNuland Another lobbyist is Ukrainian Natalia Bugayova, who was involved in Kiev s 2014 EuroMaidan coup She previously worked for the Kiev Post, a resolutely anti Russian newspaper which promotes US interests in Ukraine However, IFTSOW s most notorious lobbyist was Elizabeth O Bagy, who emerged as a Syria expert in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain O Bagy has alsocollaboratedwith the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which is further evidence of how tight knit the world of US neoconservative advocacy really is Who pays for it?Predictably, Raytheonhas openedits wallet Meanwhile, other US military contractors like General Dynamics and DynCorp are also involved L3, which provides services to the US Department of

"8 Dec, 2017",Is it true that only progressive billionaires can save humanity?,"Communism failed in the 20th century, but is allowing the super rich to dictate to the rest of humanity the only alternative system? Perhaps we need to design a socialist system, which also recognizes achievement is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London Bill Gates, the second richest person on Earth, has repeatedly criticized capitalism Back in 2015 heexplainedhis reasoning was based on a simple ecological calculation: the use of fossil fuels has to be radically reduced if we are to avoid a global catastrophe, and the private sector is too selfish to produce clean and economical alternatives to fossil fuels, which means humanity has to act outside market forces Gates himself plans to spend $2 billion of his own money on green energy, even though there s no fortune to be made from it, and he called on fellow billionaires to help make the US fossil free by 2050 with similar philanthropy From an orthodox Leftist position, it is easy to make fun of the naivety of Gates s proposal However, the more these reproaches are right, the more they render palpable the misery of the genuine Left: where is THEIR feasible proposal on what we should do? Because we know words matter in public debates: and even if what Gates is talking about is not true Socialism, ù he does talk about the fateful limitations of capitalism and, again we can ask, do the self proclaimed Socialists of the present have a serious vision of what Socialism should be today? Thus, the paradox of our predicament is that, while the resistance against global capitalism seems to fail to undermine its advance, again and again, its opponents remain strangely out of touch with many trends which clearly signal capitalism s progressive disintegration And it is as if the two tendencies (resistance and self disintegration) move at different paces and cannot meet so that we get futile protests in parallel with talk of imminent decay, but there seems to be no way to bring the two together in a coordinated act (such as capitalism s emancipatory overcoming) How did it come to this? While (most of) the Left desperately tries to protect the old workers rights against the onslaught of global capitalism, it is almost exclusively the most progressive ù capitalists themselves (from Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg) who talk about post capitalism as if the very topic of passage from capitalism, as we know it, to a new post capitalist order is appropriated by capitalism itself As a consequence, a new group of organic intellectuals ù is thus emerging: and they exemplify the privatization of our commons The figure of Elon Musk is emblematic here, and he belongs to the same class as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and others: all socially conscious billionaires And they represent global capital at its most seductive and progressive, ù in short, at its most dangerous But can then these ultra rich save us? The German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk would not be Sloterdijk if he did not draw this provocative conclusion: previously, we thought that only the (united) poor could save the world, but the twentieth century has shown the catastrophic consequences of this attitude and the destructive violence which is engendered by universalized resentment Now, in the twenty first century, we should finally have the courage to accept that only the rich can save the world, and we can argue that exceptionally creative individuals, who give generously, like Bill Gates and George Soros, have done more for the struggles for political freedom and against disease than has any state intervention Sloterdijk s diagnosis should not be confused with the usual conservative liberal rant against the so called resentment Left ù Because the central idea that sustains this rant is that we have had enough of the welfare tyranny ù that abounds in our democratic despotism ù; as in the Middle Ages, personal pride is today the greatest sin, and our fundamental right is more and more simply the right to dependence ù Welfare is today a drug on which more and more people depend A good human idea turned into a kind of opium for the people, ù as Norbert Bolz, another German thinker, explained But what makes Sloterdijk different is that he understands his proposal as a strategy to secure the survival of modern Europe s greatest economic political achievement, the social democratic Welfare State According to Sloterdijk, our reality î in Europe, at least î is objective ù social democracy as opposed to subjective ù social democracy And to keep it alive, we should create a new semantic, ù a new space of hegemonic ideas in which the culture of pride, and the recognition of the achievers (not only fiscal but also moral), will have its proper place But can this work? I don t think so Let s return to Bill Gates, he correctly locates the ultimate cause of our (ecological) problems in capitalism, and then, instead of proposing changes to the system itself, he appeals to the common sense of individual capitalists Yet, wouldn t it be much more appropriate to try to create a non capitalist system, which recognizes achievers? Are these two desires really irreconcilable?     ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/412495-zizek-gates-capitalism-planet-socialism/

UK politician Nigel Farage, the prominent face of Brexit, is now concerned about Europe s destiny Addressing the EU Parliament this week, Farage provided some thoughtful ideas as to the source of the claims that Russia had somehow manipulated the Brexitvote, as well as the Trumpelection Just last week, the electoral commission, in the UK, launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money, ùFarage said This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organization called opensociety ù But Farage, who seems to take great delight in agitating his fellow MPs, was just warming up He went on to provide yet another example of an EU parliamentarian working on behalf of George Soros, this time against Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, who hasaccusedthe financier of seeking to create a Europe of mixed population ù We even had last week Mr [Guy] Verhofstadtlobbyingon behalf of Mr Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, ùFarage said, pointing directly at Verhofstadt as he spoke I wonder, ùFarage continued, when we are talking about political collusion, I wonder if we are looking in the wrong place ù FaragedescribedSoros s influence in Strasbourg and Brussels as truly extraordinary ùAnd that influence looks set to increase dramatically now that Soros has donated the bulk of his wealth $18 billion into his opensociety pet project, which campaigns for open borders and supranational structures such as the europeanunion Farage concluded his short, fiery monologue with a weighty statement: I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international, political collusion in history ù On the surface, there seems to be some legitimacy to Farage s claim According to public sources, opensociety European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of opensociety Foundations, met with members of the European Commission on 44 separateoccasionsin 2016 And now that the organization has just been energized with $18 billion, it would seem apparent that that influence is set to increase Moreover, the Soros organizations published a pamphlet providing details on a list of 226 reliable friends ùwho serve in the European Parliament Farage said he would call on the parliament to set up a special committee to investigate the issue In a 177 page pamphletpublishedby opensociety , entitled Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014 2019), ù226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views According to the pamphlet, The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support opensociety s work Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, reliable allies ù of George Soros hold at least one third of seats So what sort of qualifications does an MEP need to be included among opensociety s reliable allies? ù A quick preview of the candidate s description field provides some good indication as to what Soros expects from his allies, including a political philosophy that includes support of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or intersex) movement, open borders and an anti Russia stance Among the 226 chosen, there is one Yana Toom, an MEP from Estonia, who comes in for a bit of criticism despite her inclusion Refused supporting the European Parliament s first resolution on the Ukraine Russia conflict in July 2014, and may be pro Russia to an unknown extent (and, in that case, not necessarily an opensociety ) ù For anyone who questions whether opensociety works directly against Russian interests, that single line should dispel all doubts Moreover, it provides some background as to why Russia in 2015 banned opensociety from operating on its territory due to the threat itposedto the country s constitutional order ù Another MEP on the list, Monica Macovei of Romania, serves as something like the golden mean for star studded Soros status Resolutely progressive; unquestionable ally of opensociety values; does not hesitate to go against her group s instructions; however, can sometimes be described as a loose cannon with her own, uncompromising set of priorities ù When reading such an assessment, one might get the mistaken impression that the European Parliament is designed to serve the will of George Soros and his highly controversial agenda, as opposed to the will of the European peoples To say that George Soros, who was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, has an influence on the global scene, would be the understatement of the century His excessive wealth allows him to finance a veritablearmy of organizations, many serving at cross purposes Indeed, Soros, 87, has been connected to movements and civil disturbances as diverse as distanced asBlack Lives Mattermovement in the US, to the Maidanuprisingin Ukraine And nowhere has Soros s influence been more felt than in the ongoing European debate over migrants It looks like the European refugee crisis, which has been blamed on the Syrian civil war, would not occur in its current intensity without the direct assistance of the opensociety Foundation Thanks to the advocacy work of the Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM), both Soros sponsored organizations, the mass resettlement of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa into Europebecamethe norm In fact, it appeared that the so called Merkel Plan ù the deal struck by the EU and Turkey was the brainchild of the European Stability Initiative, in addition to the largesse of George Soros foundations, ùF William Engdahlwrotein the Near Eastern Outlook Considering that the massive influx of Muslim migrants threatens to change the face of Christian Europe ùforever, and without any vote on the matter by the people of Europe, perhaps it is time to see exactly what kind of direct influence George Soros and his opensociety Foundation are having on European parliamentarians After all, these are not the play toys of any one individual, but the representatives of an entire state George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Robert Bridge, for RT @Robert_Bridge   ",https://www.rt.com/news/410223-soros-allies-migrants-farage-orban/

READ MORE: NGO publishes names of 2,300+ RT guests, labels them useful idiots who undermine Western democracy No, it makes me someone who s quadruple pissed off with people who attempt to understand the world from the perspective of conspiracy theories in the first place I don t deny the existence of conspiracies: in fact, far from it, because they re everywhere What I do deny is the implicit assumption that the conspirators understand the system they re attempting to manipulate For example, I ve heard plenty of conspiracy theorists assert that the 2008 financial crisis was caused by the Federal Reserve/George Soros (Hi George!)/Hedge Funds/Academic Economists Who Peddle The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, and they ù profited from it This implies they ù knew what they ù were doing Pardon me, but I ve met many of these protagonists îand in the case of academic economists, I ve worked with them for 30 years They ù don t have a clue (except George) Even those that were actively conspiring îlike many hedge funds during the subprime bubble were doing so on the basis of utterly deluded theories about how the system they were trying to game actually worked Where apparent conspiracies did work, likeSoros s puntagainst the British Pound decades ago, they did so because a CSP (Clever Sinister Person) bet against the conventional wisdom of others who thought they understood the system (and did not), rather than because the CSP set up the whole thing in the first place As for the argument that I m unwittingly playing into Vladimir Putin s malevolent plans for Western democracy by being interviewed on RT, I have three rebuttals The first and most important is that RT simply has better programs and better journalists than, for example, the BBC I would gladly discuss issues such as what caused the 2008 economic crisis on the BBC, were I asked But the BBC (and most other Western outlets that European Values and other conspiracy theorists think are superior to RT) just isn t interested in the issues With precisely two honorable exceptions, BBC programs and its journalists have only been interested in a story involving me when there was a personality angle to it I have been interviewed by the BBC 11 times since I arrived in the UK in mid 2014 Only two interviews were motivated by the journalist s or program s genuine interest in my non orthodox approach to economics: a HARDtalkinterviewin August 2016, and an interview byAlice Baxterin January 2016 Fully six were about my friendYanis Varoufakiswhen he was Greece s finance minister Two others were on November 3rd, 2016, about some news story that I ve since forgotten And my most recentinterviewon the BBC, on September 14th this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Northern Rock, was the clincher for me That failure was the most significant financial event in the UK in almost eighty years: it was the firstbankrun since the Great Depression I was pleased to be asked to discuss it on air, and I expected a serious treatment of it Instead, the item consisted of a two minute introduction by one presenter, and a three minute exchange with another which rates as one of the most vacuous interviews I ve experienced in forty five years of being interviewed by journalists (my first was as a 19 year old politically active student at the University of Sydney in 1972) I did my best to answer inane questions seriously, but as one member of my Patreon community commented, you could see my answers parting the journalist s hair That was a cruel remark, but frankly a fair one Which raises the second riposte: why aren t there shows that are interested in the in depth analysis of economic issues on the BBC? Shows like the RT staples on which I was and continue to be interviewed regularly:Capital Account,the Boom Bust, theKeiser Report,Renegade Inc, the 7pm News with Bill Dod, andGoing Underground It s not because the programs were devised by dastardly Russian stooges: most of them were developed by independent broadcasters and pitched to a number of outlets I know for a fact that at least one of these shows was pitched to the BBC before it was offered to RT They weren t interested, but RT was This isn t because the BBC îand most Western media outlets îwere too highbrow for these programs: the opposite is more the case The BBC and its commercial rivals seem more interested in infotainment than analysis, more concerned with filling time with fancy graphics and pretty (male and female) talking torsos, than in actually getting to grips with the serious economic issues in a seriously challenging world The third rebuttal, which I ll develop in more depth in a later column, is that if I can help strengthen Russia as a rival axis of power to the USA, then I think that s a good thing I d rather have a bipolar (or tripolar) battle for global dominance between two (or more) Superpowers, than have a unipolar world with a single Superpower, led by a leader with a bipolar personality     ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/409261-soros-putin-conspiracy-keen/

"11 Sep, 2017",Korean nuclear tension: Apocalypse... almost now,"The saber rattling and harsh rhetoric during the current nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula should remind mankind of something we have forgotten Atomic weapons are terrifying things, and talk of using them should be a taboo subject is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London A week or so ago, I found myself reading Agatha Christie s 80th, and penultimate, book, Passenger to Frankfurt, and its relevance to today struck me The book was published in 1970, with the subtitle an extravaganza, ùis an utter failure and was often characterized as an incomprehensible muddle ù; however, this muddle is not due to Christie s old age or senility: instead, its causes are clearly political Passenger to Frankfurt is Christie s most personal, intimately felt, and at the same time most political novel It expresses her personal confusion, her feeling of being totally at a loss with what was going on in the world in the late 1960s the drugs, the sexual revolution, student protests, murders, etc So it s no wonder that Passenger to Frankfurt is not a detective novel There is no murder, no logic, and deduction This feeling of the collapse of the elementary cognitive mapping, this overwhelming fear of chaos, is rendered precisely in Christie s introduction to the novel: Hold up a mirror to 1970 in England Look at that front page every day for a month, make notes, consider and classify Every day there is a killing A girl strangled An elderly woman attacked and robbed of her meager savings Young men or boys attacking or attacked Buildings and telephone kiosks smashed and gutted Drug smuggling Robbery and assault Children missing and children s murdered bodies found not far from their homes Can this be England? Is England really like this? Not yet, but it could be Fear is awakening, a fear of what may be And not only in our own country There are smaller paragraphs on other pages giving news from Europe, from Asia, from the Americas, in Worldwide News Hi jacking of planes Kidnapping Violence Riots Hate Anarchy All growing stronger All seeming to lead to worship of destruction, pleasure in cruelty What does it all mean? ù Is our era with † leaders ù †like Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? So what does all this mean? In the novel, Christie provides her answer a terrible worldwide conspiracy which has something to do with Richard Wagner and The Young Siegfried We learn that, toward the end of World War II, Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war He then escaped to Argentina where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel The Young Siegfried ùMeanwhile, in the book s present, drugs, promiscuity, and student protests are all secretly caused by Nazi agitators who want to bring about anarchy so that they can restore Nazi domination on a world scale This terrible worldwide conspiracy ùis, of course, ideological fantasy at its purest: a weird condensation of the fear of extreme right and extreme left The least we can say to Christie s credit is that she locates the heart of the conspiracy to the extreme right (neo Nazis) and not in any of the other usual suspects (Communism, Jews, Muslims, etc ) The idea neo Nazis were behind the 68 student protesters and sexual liberation struggle, with its obvious madness, nonetheless bears witness to the disintegration of a consistent cognitive mapping of our predicament Christie is compelled to take refuge in such a crazy paranoiac construct as the only way to introduce some order and meaning into the utter confusion and panic she found herself in But is her vision really too crazy to be taken seriously? Is our era with leaders ùlike Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? Our situation is messy in a way very similar to the one described by Christie: a rightist government enforcing workers rights (in Poland), a leftist government pursuing the strictest austerity politics (in Greece) Thus, it s no wonder that, to regain a minimal cognitive mapping, Christie resorts to WWII, the last good war, ùretranslating our mess into its coordinates One should nonetheless note how the very form of Christie s answer (one big secret agent behind it all) strangely mirrors the fascist idea of the Jewish conspiracy: how there is one big Nazi plot behind which lies the explanation to everything And, today, the extreme populist right proposes a similar explanation of the Muslim immigrant threat ùIn antisemitic imaginary, the Jew ùis the invisible master who secretly pulls the strings, which is why Muslim immigrants are NOT today s Jews: they are all too visible, not invisible They are clearly not integrated into our societies, and nobody claims they secretly pull strings if one sees in their invasion of Europe ùa secret plot, then Jews have to be behind it As was the case in a text that recently appeared in one of the main Slovenian Rightist weekly journals where we could read: George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time, ùresponsible for the invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU as a typical Talmudo Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of Western civilization, the nation state and white, European man ù His goal is to build a rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work hating cultural Marxists, ùwhich would then perform a deconstruction of the nation state, and transform the EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe ùFurthermore, Soros is inconsistent in his promotion of multiculturalism: He promotes it exclusively in Europe and the USA, while in the case of Israel, he, in a way which is for me totally justified, agrees with its monoculturalism, latent racism and building a wall In contrast to the EU and USA, he also does not demand from Israel to open its borders and accept refugees A hypocrisy appropriate to Talmudo Zionism ù[Quoted from Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç, George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time (in Slovene), Demokracija, August 25 2016, p 15 ] Is this disgusting fantasy which brings together antisemitism and Islamophobia so different from the one staged by Christie? Are they both not a desperate attempt to orient oneself in confused times? The extreme oscillations in the public perception of the Korean crisis are significant as such One week we are told we are on the brink of nuclear war, then there is a week of respite, then the war threat explodes again When I visited Seoul in August 2017, my friends there told me there is no significant threat of a war since the North Korean regime knows it cannot survive it, but now the South Korean authorities are preparing the population for a nuclear war In such a situation, where the apocalypse is on the horizon, one should bear in mind the standard logic of probability no longer applies, we need a different logic, described by Jean Pierre Dupuy: The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as destiny, for sure, but also as a contingent accident if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example, it could not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not occur, it is not inevitable It is thus the event s actualization the fact that it takes place which retroactively creates its necessity ù[ Jean Pierre Dupuy, Petite metaphysique des tsunami, Paris: Seuil 2005, p 19 ] Dupuy provides the example of the French presidential elections in May 1995; here is the January forecast of the main polling Institute: If on next May 8th, Mr (√âdouard) Balladur will be elected, one can say the presidential election was decided before it even took place ù The moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities When applied to the recent tension in Korea, this means: IF the war explodes, it will be necessary and inevitable; IF war will not explode, it was all a false alarm This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of nuclear (or ecological) catastrophe: not to realistically ùappraise the possibilities of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on the background of this acceptance, we should mobilize ourselves to perform the act which will change destiny itself and thereby insert a new possibility into the situation Instead of saying the future is still open, we still have the time to act and prevent the worst, ù one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable, and then work to undo what is already written in the stars ùas our destiny What is needed is no less than a new global anti nuclear movement, a global mobilization that would exert pressure on nuclear powers and act aggressively, organizing mass protests and boycotts, while denouncing our leaders as criminals and the like It should focus not only on North Korea but also on those super powers who assume the right to monopolize nuclear weapons The very public mention of the use of nuclear weapons should be treated as a criminal offense And more than that, a global change in our stance is needed, what Peter Sloterdijk calls the domestication of the wild animal culture ù Till now, each culture disciplined and educated its own members and guaranteed civic peace among them in the guise of state power, but the relationship between different cultures and states was permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each state of peace nothing more than a temporary armistice As Hegel conceptualized it, the entire ethic of a state culminates in the highest act of heroism, the readiness to sacrifice one s life for one s nation state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within a state Is today s North Korea with its ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons, and rockets to deliver them to distant targets, not the ultimate example of this logic of unconditional nation state sovereignty? However, the moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities A task rendered all the more difficult by the ongoing rise of sectarian religious and ethnic heroic ùviolence and readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one s specific cause The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/402959-korean-nuclear-christie-apocalypse-zizek/
"5 Jun, 2017","If George Soros is the answer to the EU crisis, what on earth is the question?","Just as a stopped clock is right twice a day, George Soros, a man who s done more to destabilize countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis Mr Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1 It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars Where Mr Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent ù Soros funded groups are only network following mafia ways in Hungary Orbanhttps:// tdotco /NPoXZlq4e3pic twitter com/CsQoLf1Sle The truth of the matter is that the Soviet Union liberated Europe from fascism, that without the inordinate tenacity and sacrifice of the Soviet Russian people and the Red Army, Hitler would have succeeded in colonizing the continent As US historian Peter Kuznick writes, Up to [D Day, June 1944], the Soviet Union had almost singlehandedly battled the German military Until the invasion of Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten Germany lost over 6 million men on the Eastern Front and approximately one million on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean ù Returning to Mr Soros speech we are regaled with the assertion that the EU is surrounded by hostile powers Putin s Russia, Erdogan s Turkey, Sisi s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can t ù Here again, the billionaire investor is guilty of peddling a convenient inversion of the truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr Soros, also happens to be a member It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: Russia s surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr Soros is right to point out that if the europeanunion carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement That is why the europeanunion needs to be radically reinvented ù The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self evident detriment of millions of working people It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short term investment as and where the opportunity arises It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08 The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti politics or to be more specific anti politics as usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward

Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September That s an inner German situation There s another situation coming from our West European neighbors We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social democraticparty no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social democraticparty SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse SS:Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War SS:Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President SS:Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality SS:Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population SS:Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment SS:There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems SS:Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/
"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety , limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ If you were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The opensociety Institute (OSI) and opensociety Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the europeanunion , going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/

Germany imposed an austerity program that served its narrow self interest ù Russophrenia: Western elites ignore their own citizens anger and blame Russia instead (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /h5UohS2ceE This is very unfair to Berlin The difference here is that the Marshall Plan followed the most destructive war humanity has ever known, and the US was not practicing pure benevolence either It was acting in naked self interest, because it feared all of Europe turning communist And despite Marxist Moscow helping to win the conflict, it was abundantly clear that the USSR and the US would compete for global domination in the new world order of the time Thus, the US was creating a buffer zone against the Soviets and bolstering allies it would need for its own protection, and for the maintenance of the capitalist system it promoted Germany s situation in 2008 was rather different Berlin was not seeking to become a global superpower, and the public was not pushing for it either Also, there was no ideology in play, other than a belief that countries should live within their means Furthermore, Germany had recently completed a costly reunification, and its economy was only returning to growth after a decade of near stagnation For the average German in 2008, the last thing on their mind was becoming Europe s hegemonic power Soros attack on Germany is probably borne out of personal frustration over Merkel s lack of willingness to push for further European integration Yet, this policy is merely a reflection of what her electorate wants Miserly Germans are unable to countenance financially supporting profligate southern Europeans As a result, the Euro currency project, which Merkel s predecessor Helmut Kohl was basically forced into by France, has always had a questionable long term future Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants #GeorgeSoros(Op Ed by Sam Gerrans)https:// tdotco /Kgqh4ICNxGpic twitter com/3HC9l5tljI If we believe Soros back story (and many have questioned it), he pushes liberal democracy for perfectly valid reasons The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler s Germany in 1944, ù he writes Later, of course, this regime was replaced with a totalitarian communist system before he fled Budapest in 1947 In his op ed, Soros tells us that his experiences in Britain and the United States taught him how open societies ù are the only ones which guarantee the safety of their people Indeed, the Hungarian may be right about this However, where he has long failed is in understanding the reasons why some countries are not ready for the kind of liberalism he espouses Let s remember how hechuckedmillions of dollars into pro western movements inUkraine A man born and raised in neighboring Hungary should have been well aware of how divided the country was, and known that his actions could lead to turmoil Especially given that his homeland has a stake in the southwestern part, where Hungarian is often the spoken language Yet, he ploughed ahead, and his actions helped to destroy the country The billionaire now says the only explanation I can find (for the electorate s rejection of globalization/liberalism) is that elected leaders failed to meet voters legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy ù Yes, this is really George Soros writing The same George Soros who attends Davos every year Because, if you were looking for a symbol of where the elites and the plebs most diverge, it would probably be at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain commune Where the rulers of the world look down on us mere mortals from the highest town in Europe (at 1,560 meters) Davos is the problem, not the solution (Op Edge by@NeilClark66)https:// tdotco /bwKAWPhSx5pic twitter com/49L7oGSMKq But Soros then decides to pin a large part of the blame on a figure who has never been much of a cheerleader for Davos Merkel And he goes on to predict the demise of the EU itself With economic growth lagging and the refugee crisis out of control, the EU is on the verge of breakdown and is set to undergo an experience similar to that of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s ù The reason for the EU s impending doom is apparently the 2017 election cycle, where the contests in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France will be key In the latter, the two leading contenders [Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon] are close to Putin and eager to appease him, ù according to Soros French people sacrifice their own interests to help Putin win the world? (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /qctrsI5Dtn So, now we are finally on to Putin Soros feels that if either Le Pen or Fillon wins, Putin s dominance of Europe will become a fait accompli ù He writes: I am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of opensociety ù This is because Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about ù Put plainly, the notion that Putin somehow engineered the French election to organize a contest between Fillon and Le Pen (which is still not guaranteed) is preposterous But this is the trauma filled world Soros now inhabits And he goes on to make another ridiculous statement: In a brilliant move, he [Putin] exploited social media companies business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies That is how he helped Trump get elected ù In other words, Soros thinks Putin manipulated Facebook and Twitter to win the US election for Trump This argument is ridiculous and makes Soros look stupid It also suggests that he s throwing his rattle out of the pram because a few democratic decisions have gone against him And he needs to denigrate Merkel and use Putin as a bogeyman in order to deflect any mud from himself But lets look at the reality here Soros strongly opposed George W Bush s presidency He funded the Move On project and threwmillionsuponmillionsat the democraticparty What this interference did was help remove them from their working class base and transform them into a globalist party, which now seems to win only in coastal metropolitan areas Shorn of a need to fund raise to the same extent as before, leftists used Soros money to focus on identity politics , which alienates the white working class And that same blue collar group voted overwhelmingly for Trump this fall For his own part, Soros, ironically at Davos,predictedthat Trump had no chance of being elected president And he was wrong Now it appears he can t deal with the outcome Perhaps because he feels his life s work is slipping away The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/372921-soros-eu-democracy-putin-merkel/
"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia If there were a hero of the year list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian led airstrikes One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself a decision that also took out the approaching enemy John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko s single act of heroism when he wrote: I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism –£ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥ –ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–æ–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å –Ω–∞ —Å–µ —è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞https:// tdotco /vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that NATO does not seek confrontation, and that it is everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race, the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever closer to Russia s borders However, as Pepe Escobarexplained, The real measure ù is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018 This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s Putin emphasized that NATO s inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to respond adequately to any threat to its national interests On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, Jamala (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision s rules Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors: The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!, Clark concluded via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is, In God We Trust Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as The Satanic Temple (TST) Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics, Thranholm wrote TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000 One of the group s objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan ù Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ù,according to a promotional video Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from God Country : Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US led countries continued with their regime change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from † war torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe s welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants, that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros plan will reap positive benefits via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the forced migration caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it: If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states, Gerrans concluded The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber if not outright disastrous outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance Following news that Germany s Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded: Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign No more In a highly controversial move, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19 year old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony Let s deal with some facts here, Cunningham continued Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years So much then for claims of Russian state sponsored doping ù Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance enhancing drug only in January of this year In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances The US anti doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add insult to injury As Bryan MacDonaldexplained: Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency The reader will be able to discern the line of reasoning in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone: Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes ù In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov s murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs, Whitmore tells us So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime It could also turn out to be a harbinger ù As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump s landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back door machinations Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania The idea didn t seem so wild at the time for a Clinton coup as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306 232), he failed to win the popular vote reportedly by 2 5 million votes Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton in similar fashion to George W Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court could steal the White House from Trump This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes, Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle of so called faithless electors tipping this contest in Clinton s favor Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton an unlikely yet possible scenario Trump went on to formally secure the vote and the presidency on December 19 via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor: Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence ù that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved ù in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta ù against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still ongoing hacking operations from the air Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace Happy New Year!

"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro Clinton supporter In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton s particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4 8 years of US led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton s War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes, What s the point of having this superb military if we can t use it? And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq which was half a million dead Iraqi children was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded, We think the price is worth it Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball: Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government But it is already clear that Russia s intervention in our election on Trump s side is the real scandal of 2016 Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia s (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the real scandal of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange s torturous, slow drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind boggling list of poor decision making The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics, Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans nothing to look at here, please move on Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton s chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump s victory chances on Nov 8th And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC †chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton Trump CNN hosted debate The jaw dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate style investigation By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either But that s mere child s play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad Clinton s leaky emails point to the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of †ISIS †of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including †ISIS, that s there in those emails, the WikiLeaks co founder said There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone, he added Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of collateral damage in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We ll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers ù Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich as opposed to Russia was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr Rich ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered îat dawn îas he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild conspiracy theories, yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about Russian involvement in the WikiLeaks Although it may be perfectly true that Mr Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government îthe Russians When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America s global military footprint if elected president, neo conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American style fascism Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals like George W Bush and, yes, Barack Obama who pledge to continue America s wars of expansion and empire Clinton s past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to Make America Great Again Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures Assange òsorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t co/6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A Mussomeli in the Washington Post, of all places really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump: Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al Assad in Syria, are frightened But what really troubles them is [Trump s] generally level headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs †Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep s clothing î just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf s clothing Anne Applebaum, perennial anti Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange s work with groundless accusations: Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen Philip Breedlove †and probably others The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U S democratic process and, again, the elite ù who supposedly run it Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum s diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess Albright claimed that Russia seeks to undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr Assange, the value of that statement for themselves So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton s rat infested ship once and for all We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365545-madeleine-albright-clinton-neocon/

others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called colorrevolution s, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps:// tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the opensociety Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety , we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/

"8 May, 2016",Russia: The new baddie ‚Äì again,"Each leader the West wants to take down is really the same stock character brought back in slightly different attire after the commercial break; Saddam, Gaddafi and Assad are all the same guy: the archetypal Darth Vader to our Luke Skywalker Within this simplistic, childlike meta narrative nothing the baddies do can be good As those in charge of our propaganda know, the vague, malevolent force which characterizes all our baddies is a much better reason to attack them than anything based in reality Thus, baddies have no convincing backstory They are evil because well, just because And that is precisely why they must be overcome While the West had other countries to trash, it let Russia slide in and out of various tenuous sub plots But now that Western enemies in the Middle East are burning nicely, the script has space for the development of a new central baddie as the prelude to Well, we all know what One struggles to remember a time when Russia could do anything right in the eyes of Western media It liked the end of the Cold War and the Yeltsin era when Russia was handing over the nation s wealth to non Russian interests; a people elbowing each other out of the way in a fight for shiny trinkets that was acceptable The pre story to that drama was the deal Gorbachev cut with the US Under Gorbachev, the USpromisednot to encroach on Russia s sphere of influence a fact now denied by the US, naturally But at the time it was true, and it gave Russia the confidence it needed to let Communism go and allow personal initiative to find a level Fast forward thirty years and NATO is busy fillingPolandwith troops, and claims outrage when Russia monitors its activities in theBaltics However, when the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to re join Russia, this result was rejected by Western media as lacking any legitimacy Russians now get it that in the post Soviet stage play called international politics anyone with traditional values who doesn t clap wildly when his own side takes a hit will be hissed at while the piano clangs away menacingly in the corner They understand that talk about fairness, democracy, choice and equality is just that: talk They have seen how globalism works And unsurprisingly they aren t interested in much more of it In a BBC piece purporting to measure attitudes towards what it calls global citizenship , Russia isidentifiedas the most backward country on earth Feeling like a global citizen (i e having abandoned all the values your grandfather would have laid his life down to uphold) is assumed by the BBC to be the very definition of virtue Spain is found to be the country most wholeheartedly throwing itself over the cliff edge, with what the piece calls an eye catching majority of 84 percent believing that they should take in more of those fleeing the five year civil war in Syria The fallacies are instantly obvious to anyone with a functioning brain: Syria s civil war is entirely the result of sustained attacks by western money and mercenaries, and four out of five refugees arenot from Syria Syria was slated by the US for what it calls regime change i e unilaterally going into a country which had done it no harm and committing mass murder in order to hand that country over to the same central banking system which runs everywhere else The source for this plan was disclosed by none other than General Wesley Clark But none of that matters The main thing is that globalism is super fab, and if you don t want more of it, you re backward and probably deserve theeconomic warwaged against you because you don t roll over in the face of NATO or Soros backed aggression Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski that master of how things actually are rather than how we are told to think about them famously said: Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves They ll only be able to parrot the information they ve been given on the previous night s news ù He was right Western publics are nothing if not malleable Not only is the ability to reason independently largely absent, people also have little or no memory And their attitudes towards Russia are no exception Having spent the last few years in Europe, I am constantly impressed by how immune to either facts or reason the general population is People will say in all seriousness that Putin is behind the current invasion of Europe repeating theclaimput out there by former NATO chief US General Philip Breedlove, who has been replaced by General Curtis M Scaparrotti, a man who is busy moving all his pieces into the very spaces on Russia s border the US promised never to occupy Resurgent Russia : New hardline#NATOEurope commander raises hackles in Moscowhttps:// tdotco /DDNNywPuPHpic twitter com/wrSAxrUwG8 Under Yelstin, Russia was nothing but an economic target; weak and failing, and selling off the family silver for pennies on the dollar while signing wholesale into law legislation handed to it by US NGOs with agendas entirely inimical to those of the Russian people Yet in the bed time story version of events for popular western consumption, Yeltsin was a goodie Had his successor continued in the same vein allowing foreign interests to asset strip the country the narrative today, doubtless, would be that Russia is free I have seen enough of how realpolitik works not to expect anything from any government ever beyond intrusion into my life and the appropriation of a proportion of what I generate I regard belief in government per se as a sort of weakness So while I understand westerners who rightly disillusioned by their own countries choose to see Putin as a lone hero fighting a rear guard action against globalism, I don t exactly share their sentiments One can t help but have a twinge of envy when looking at Russia s Putin Firstly, he is both bright and sober When a journalist asks him a question, he has the ability to answer it well and often with humor Even given the hopeless translations into English in the media, at least some of what is in the original Russian comes across Secondly, he is professional He demonstrates an appropriate CEO level grasp on his responsibilities Thirdly, he describes the world and acts within it like a man who regards people in his own country as his principle stakeholders Whether this is in fact the case is at least in my opinion impossible to tell But it makes for a refreshing and enjoyable narrative In the West, we are simply not used to this type of presentation Given the controlled demolition of Europe, it is clear now to those who retain their natural instincts that those who make the big decisions in Europe are simply acting liketraitors Thus, at the level of narrative, the Western propaganda machine is left with a thorny plot point to resolve Since relative to Putin the goodies have made themselves look decidedly Darth Vadery around the gills, the implication is obvious to anyone who knows how stories work: the Force is now with Putin This is highly problematic; a narrative meltdown The confusion and dilution of the villain archetype mid drama as anyone who has followed Star Wars will know can mean only one thing: that a brand new, conflict heavy storyline is on its way @SamGerrans     ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/342285-russia-new-baddie-again/

"9 Apr, 2016",Why Sitting Bull was right about Washington‚Äôs lack of integrity,"That integrity is a foreign land where Washington is concerned is an inarguable fact In the latest example, the failure to complete the construction of a nuclear disposal plant agreed with Russia once again leaves Washington s credibility in tatters Underlying this issue is the attempt by the US federal government to alter the terms of theagreementit signed with Russia in 2000 for the disposal of weapons grade plutonium, with each country building industrial plants with this specific objective in mind Russia has kept its side of the bargain and, at no small cost, built the facility required to dispose of its excess nuclear material in the manner agreed The US on the other hand is now looking at an alternative method of disposal, which amounts to storing said material in a process that allows it to retain its breakout potential ù i e its ability to be converted back into weapons grade plutonium Not what we agreed on : Processing method swap violates US Russian plutonium dealhttps:// tdotco /kePBWpIv3qpic twitter com/EA3MiCeGWl Given the record of subterfuge and double dealing on the part of successive US governments when it comes to its failure to honour treaties and agreements, nobody should be surprised Indeed, this subterfuge is so common where Washington is concerned that you could be forgiven for considering it a quintessentially American trait Since 2000 alone, the record in this regard makes stark reading The willfully false assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of WMD, for example, was used as justification for one of the most disastrous wars ever unleashed, certainly in modern times, which only succeeded in plunging Iraq and the wider entire region into a dark night of terrorism and sectarian bloodletting It is a state of affairs that shows no evidence of abating anytime soon, 13 years later Following on from that, when Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, he did so as the supposed antidote to the arrogance and mendacity that typified the Bush years before him One of his very first pledges upon taking office was that he would close of the controversial US prison facility, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, during his first term in office It was a pledge and an announcement that met with support across the world, given that along with rendition, waterboarding and torture, the very name Guantanamo conjured up his predecessor s war on terror, ù which replaced international law with might is right as the cornerstone of global affairs Yet despite Obama s pledge, 15 years later Guantanamo remains in operation Behind its bars 37 inmates, denied the right to due process, continue to be held in a state of legal limbo Compounding the scandal of this US military prison facility is the fact it exists on Cuba s sovereign territory despite repeated demands by the Cuban government for it to be returned More recently, we have had the scandal of thePanama Papers, containing evidence of mass and wholesale financial and tax impropriety by leading politicians, corporate executives and the super rich However, an even bigger story has been the politicization of the information contained within these papers throughout the Western media, involving a transparent attempt to smear Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, even though neither his name nor the name of any member of his family appears anywhere in them This is no surprise considering that the misnamed International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), based in Washington, is the body responsible for leaking the information to the media The ICIJ is the international arm of the US Center for Public Integrity, an organization that counts among its major donors George Soros s opensociety Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and the Carnegie Endowment, among others This has to explain why out of all the people whose names have been leaked thus far there are conspicuously few American citizens among them Do they really expect us to believe that the US is immune to financial corruption? Really?

Army liberate Palymra from ISIS, thus pushing back US plans for regime change in Syria still further and that the documents had been shared with two particular organizations, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)which receives funding from George Soros opensociety Institutes and in the case of the former,

enemy of the Russian government (at Davos this year he made his usualattackson Russia and its policies) and any leaks and allegations that would show Putin in a bad light would of course further his agenda The lack of prominent US individuals among the 11 million released documents has also raised a few eyebrows suspicions understandable when no US officials & corporate media gatekeeping the leakshttps:// tdotco /pyNLoUyOyR But if we are indeed talking about a US/ Sorosian conspiracy to foment trouble in Russia in a parliamentary election year, then it s a plan which seems to owe more to Baldrick than Albert Einstein While official enemies Putin and Assad duly made the headlines on day one of the news leak, the story has now moved on and threatens to jeopardize the careers of individuals Washington surely wouldn t want to see affected Furthermore, the leaks also put into the spotlight the turbo globalist, elite friendly economic system designed not in Russia, but by self styled free marketers in the US and Britain in the 1970s A Pandora s Box has been opened by the Panama leaks and ironically given the ICIJ and the OCCRP s funding it s billionaire global capitalists like George Soros who have done very well out of the economic changes of the last forty years who have most to fear from the populist backlash Here s the rub: Since the late 1970s and the advent of Thatcherism and Reagonomics, we ve seen a massive transfer of wealth from the majority to the super rich as elite friendly neoliberal policies replaced the more collectivist ones which operated in the thirty or so years following World War II In Britain, a report of the OECD in 2011 found the income share of the top one percent more than doubled in the period 1970 to 2005 Last October, Oxfamrevealedthat half the world s wealth was in the hands of just one percent of the population The Panama leaks, described by whistleblower Edward Snowden as the biggest leak in the history of data journalism, ùshow us how the global super rich exploit the current system still further to keep their wealth away from the taxman and get even richer at our expense And what the revelations make clear is that the super rich wouldn t be able to do this without the help of banks, lawyers, accountants and other intermediaries who most clearly do not act in the public interest British neocons and Sorosian liberals who no doubt gloated over Monday s headlines in the US and Britain involving Putin and Assad really don t have anything to shout about, because while no one named in the leaks comes out smelling of roses, it s Washington s most obedient ally Britain and its political and financial elites that arguably comes out of this scandal worst of all The UK harbours the largest tax

any other countries in the Panama Papers All in all, 1,900 British firms feature, and more than half of the 300,000 firms believed to have used the services of Mossack Fonesca are registered in

millionaire stockbroker, was the director of an investment fund called Blairmore, which was incorporated in Panama and run from The Bahamas The fund, which helped the super rich shield investments

give him the life of privilege he s enjoyed #panamapapers Only a week or so ago, it was revealed that over 300 public libraries had been forced to close in England and Wales since 2010 because of spending cuts These cuts we re told are made to help reduce the government deficit, but imagine how healthy the public finances would be if instead of tax dodging and helping others to tax dodge, multi millionaires like the Prime Minister s father had paid their proper contribution? As opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn correctly stated: This is money that s taken from our health service, our local services ù At a time of plenty, tax dodging by the super rich might lead to a shrug of the shoulders, but at a time of cuts which are havingdisastrous consequenceson individuals and communities,it s enough to turn the mildest, most politically moderate person into a pitchfork carrying revolutionary One name you know you ll never find in the#PanamaPapers: Jeremy Bernard Corbyn#OurCorbynpic twitter com/VLlxuK4pui In Britain the #PanamaPapers revelations are likely to provide a boost for Jeremy Corbyn ahead of important local elections next month And in America, Bernie Sanders could be the beneficiary An article in Wednesday s Independent newspaper in Britainarguesthat The Panama Papers could hand Bernie Sanders the White House ù Nobody is going to be under more pressure than Hillary Clinton, ùargues Matthew Turner For some Americans, she is the embodiment of a global elite; while Bernie Sanders is its antithesis The huge leak exposes governments across the globe willfully ignoring tax avoidance by the rich Although Clinton has not been linked to any malfeasance in the leak, there is a sense that she is among the elite rich, some of whose members have benefited from such schemes ù Well, if the #PanamaPapers do help Bernie to the White House and indeed Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 in Britain we can only imagine what George Soros s reaction would be After all this is a man who hasdonated$7m to a Hillary Clinton super PAC For all his progressive talk, the very last thing the liberal George Soros would like to see is a return of socialistic economies in the West and across the world He has after all spent decades helping to topple and destabilize governments which put their people before the interests of predatory global capitalists and hedge funders like himself Is his anti Putin obsession so great he d risk bringing the whole system down with him?

"24 Mar, 2016",America faces its moment of Trump,"The meteoric rise of Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner who is giving the Establishment 3D nightmares, is the natural outcome of a political system that has been arrogantly ignoring the will of the American electorate for many years Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge What started off as cheap comic fodder for late night television, and later ignored by the elite as an unfortunate yet containable nuisance, has now exploded on the scene as a destructive force of nature capable of blowing away the Establishment s corporate owned power structure Yes, we are talking about The Donald, a Category 5 political hurricane that is expected to cause major devastation should it touchdown in the Beltway So anxious are the Democrats (and Republicans!) to contain the mighty Trump they will even deny his First Amendment right to address his supporters Yes, while many Americans travel great distances at their own expense to listen to Trump s white hot political message, perennial provocateur George Soros must pay his puppets to erect roadblocks and hoist placards to deny free passage to the venues Who says freedom loving, liberal activists lack a sense of irony? Trump on Putin s compliment: Great honor https:// tdotco /WPsiSWKYQApic twitter com/2WmfxnGvsn Last week, for example, demonstrations in Chicago organized by the Soros funded MoveOn org group forced Trump to cancel a speaking engagement Later, on March 20, members of the same subversive outfitblocked trafficnear a Trump event in Arizona, while police in New York City the same day pepper sprayed demonstrators, some of whom are affiliated with violent anarchist groups And then there s the corporate owned media, which, instead of impartially and dispassionately reporting on Trump s rising star, is working on behalf of its owners to knock it out of the sky Here is a random CNN smearpiece, which opens with the angst ridden line: Anti Trump Republicans desperate to stop the billionaire from being their nominee are discussing creative ways to halt his momentum ùSo the story now is not about the millions of Americans who support Trump s political ideas, nor even discussing what those ideas might be, but rather about how the racist, misogynist, sexist outsider must be stopped Consider these two competing lines from another CNNarticle, and how they work to manipulate the mind of the reader regarding the boastful ùTrump and the proud ùClinton: Trump repeatedly boasts about the failure of millions of dollars in attack aids to wound his campaign, and insists he is on pace to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination ù While the very next about Clinton reads: Clinton said she was very proud to have won Arizona and hit Republican candidates who she said were literally inciting bigotry and violence ù But it is not just the Democrats and the liberal media working to sabotage Trump s campaign Incredibly, even the republicanparty is plotting against their own frontrunner, as Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox Newsexplained But why would the GOP work against Trump if he represents the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? #HillaryClintonspeaks at#AIPAC2016conference [VIDEO]https:// tdotco /X1yGaBHOvM Pirro nails it with this answer to herself: The Republican establishment are in bed with the Democrats So if Hillary wins, nothing is lost for them It s business as usual The lobbyists keep their offices on K Street, the pharmaceutical companies keep paying them and the lawmakers get their re election bribes I mean, contributions ù Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, when asked to explain the elite s refusal to support Trump, perhaps gave away a bit too much information when hesaid: Well, because he s an outsider, he s not them, he s not part of the club, he s uncontrollable, he hasn t been through the initiation rites, he didn t belong to the secret society ù Initiation rites? Secret societies? Secret handshakes? Did Newt just join ranks with the conspiracy theorists? Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers One of his regular claims aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him Although it is a delicious sight watching America s movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold hearted wretchedness of the dual party, borderline fascist system Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks The Establishment would continue unmolested with its too big to jail banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power Trump s ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they d work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril This polarizing issue largely explains Trump s huge popularity among voters today The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump s political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the republicanparty as we know it Amazing comments from the Pope considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank you very much Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff raff According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US Mexican border But the crazy is just beginning Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing Only the government could script such a narrative But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, ùsaid Garza This right here is border insecurity at its best Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities ù If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right wing parties, I really can t imagine it And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political correct speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from No, sending a message to other would be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W Bush s reckless 8 year war on terror Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it He never explained that decision to the public ù A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be All Americans knew is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job ù Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non consequential 8 year intermission by America s first black president) Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree) I think this is a great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, ùshe told C Span early last year I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that ù But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America s former shine @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/

A: All go to a luxury Swiss resort very yearpic twitter com/0cm9PJSFOj It s worth reflecting on how well the world was doing before Professor Klaus Schwab had his bright idea for a European Management Forum The 1960s was an era of great economic, social and cultural advances for ordinary people across the globe These advances continued into the 1970s The world had never before been so democratic and never before had its wealth been so evenly shared But starting with the coup which toppled the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and saw him replaced with the capital friendly dictator and human rights oppressor Augusto Pinochet, the global economic order was restructured in the interests of a tiny but very greedy elite who were unhappy that their share of the cake had shrunk in the genuinely progressive period following World War Two A hallmark of this neoliberal era has been the way states have been captured to serve the interests of international finance capital and giant global corporations Publicly owned assets have been privatized, providing rich pickings for the banks and financial institutions who handle the sales Meanwhile, the very rich have enjoyed generous tax cuts if they even pay tax at all Meanwhile, austerity is imposed on the majority Davos has played a key role in this process If the World Economic Forum has a habit of coming up with big business friendly solutions it s no surprise, as itsmembers comprise 1,000 of the world s top corporations, global enterprises usually with more than US$5 billion in turnover Last week, as the well heeled attendees arrived in Davos in their private jets, Oxfamreleasedits latest report on global inequality The report revealed that the richest 1% now own more than the rest of the people in the world combined A more shocking indictment of forty odd years of neoliberalism would be hard to find It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super rich so few, you could fit them all on a single coach, says Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB s chief executive He might also have said we could fit the small group of the global super rich in one hotel in Davos, which is where most of them probably were last week We won t get any meaningful change arising from anything proposed at Davos because the iniquitous status quo is in the interest of those who fund the World Economic Forum To solve the problems of today we need to do away with elite gatherings attended by everyone who matters and re democratize our politics and our economies In short, we need to take power away from the billionaires who meet each year at Davos, and return it to the people Follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/330046-davos-problem-global-economy-elite/

everybody It is no longer acceptable to be yourself This agenda serves the 1 percent and Washington, Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist, told RT in an interview Billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has attracted attention once again, this time saying the europeanunion should take at least a million refugees every year to ease the mass exodus of desperate people from the Middle East and Africa Soros wants the EU to dig deep and pay an annual amount of at least 5,000 per refugee, or 20 billion And this coming at a time of severe austerity measures pushed onto the European people, not to mention the bailout of entire countries, like Greece The Lonely Chancellor: Merkel Under Fire as Refugee Crisis Worsenshttps:// tdotco /ZqV8ScWwzQ Thus, it s little wonder that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says philanthropists like Soros must assume part of the blame for the current crisis This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state, Orban told reporters This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros Soros responded by issuing anemailstatement to Bloomberg Business, †claiming his international organization works to uphold European values ù,while Mr Orban s efforts to fortify the Hungarian border thereby halting a massive wave of illegal migrants undermine those values ù His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle, ùSoros added Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle ù READ MORE: Hungarian PM blames Soros for fueling refugee crisis in Europe Paul Craig Roberts offers his own interpretation as to what has precipitated this crisis of epic proportions as millions of foreigners now descend en masse on European communities, many of which are totally unprepared for the influx of foreigners It is Washington s wars, ùnot George Soros per se, that are forcing the refugees to flee their homelands and seek to enter Europe, Roberts believes Since the Clinton regime, we ve had three two term American presidents who have been at war, ùhe said They have created millions of displaced people and they are now seeking refuge in Europe ù Merkel s stance on#RefugeesCrisis naive, irrational former Czech presidenthttp:// tdotco /8tMFCf8IHNpic twitter com/uvONW5UUIw Roberts also asks whether Soros advice regarding Europe absorbing millions of refugees is based on something other than just humanitarian considerations We have to first ask the question whether Soros progressive causes are real or merely a cover for rule by the 1 percent, ùRoberts said You see, when political boundaries are broken down the result is a power vacuum to which Washington and the 1 percent can move in their pawns ù One consequence of Washington s wars over the course of three presidencies has been to destroy stable countries and leave in their place disorganized, small fiefdoms that war on one another, ùRoberts said What Soros means is: European values means you lost your national identity and you become a hodgepodge of different cultures and different nationalities and your traditional historical existence is dissolved in this pot of diverse peoples ù Migrants & refugees sue Berlin s main refugee center for delays to welfare handoutshttp:// tdotco /uXEPqpEfJOpic twitter com/fbri4tcGHq Roberts applauds Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orban], saying he is exactly correct that this is a threat to the existence of European peoples because they become dissolved in a so called diverse society of different people, different religions, different cultures, different values ù But for those individuals like George Soros who comprise the 1 percent of the global elite, their goal is to redefine what it means to be a European George Soros is in effect saying: We are redefining Europe Europe no longer consists of Hungarians, British, French, Germans and Greeks, etc It now consists of everybody And all of you historical people to be European means you have to be part of everybody You can no longer be yourselves That s the message ù Refugee rhetoric reminiscent of pre Holocaust sentiment UN human rights chiefhttp:// tdotco /BWeB1Qaiohpic twitter com/Bdi98Gp4Zw Yet there is little resistance to the agenda because Europeans have heard the same message repeated so many times they have been brainwashed, ùwhich then makes it easy for their so called leaders to open the borders and accept all of these refugees that Washington s wars have created ù Roberts also makes a dramatic claim, saying that every country that joined the europeanunion has committed an act of national suicide ù It seems to me that of all the leaders of Eastern and Western Europe, the Hungarian prime minister is the only one that has any sense He says: We re not going to commit suicide If Germany wants to commit suicide, fine If they want to follow Merkel into suicide, let them But not us ù Hungary s PM accuses George Soros of undermining European nations on refugeeshttps:// tdotco

the scenes destabilizing the country so as to prop up a Western friendly puppet leadership Indeed, Western non government organization have been operating freely in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union According to Roberts, it should come as no surprise as to where the funding for such large scale, operations originates And all of these non governmental organizations, they are funded by private donors, such as Soros, they are funded by the Department of State, the National Endowment for Democracy and they all serve as agents of Washington foreign policy And this is the way that very wealthy individuals like Soros come together with the government ù But this is not just an act of aggression against the Ukrainian people, but an attack on Russia itself, ùRoberts says This is an effort to weaken Russia, to threaten Russia, to make Russia back off from its resistance to American hegemony over the world, ùRoberts proclaims These behind the scenes operations, which work under the cover of lofty sounding agencies, benefit the United States by making it impossible for a European government to exist independently and therefore Washington does not have to worry about European governments such as Germany realizing that their own national interests are contrary to American national interests ù Ultimately, the work of these philanthropists and non governmental organizations is designed to break apart European national identity in order to prevent any sort of loss of the American empire to independent foreign policies among European countries, ùRoberts says If you don t have a country, you can t have a foreign policy What is the foreign policy of Libya [laughs]? What is the foreign policy of Iraq? What is the foreign policy of Afghanistan? What is the foreign policy of Somalia?

"26 Mar, 2015",Anti-Shia victim blaming & its roots in Iranophobia,"Since ISIS exploded onto the world stage last year, a common meme to have gained traction is that had Iraq s Sunni Arabs been given a bit more power, there would ve been no ISIS This is a dangerous fallacy that ignores some uncomfortable realities Eisa Ali is a correspondent at RT UK bureau in London He is also a political analyst with a focus on Iraq, Lebanon & Syria He studied Law & Marketing at university before becoming a documentary film maker, journalist and writer His writing has appeared onAntiwar com, Informed Comment & Digital Resistance and he has appeared on the BBC, Press TV, and Etejah English as an analyst and commentator Eisa Ali is a correspondent at RT UK bureau in London He is also a political analyst with a focus on Iraq, Lebanon & Syria He studied Law & Marketing at university before becoming a documentary film maker, journalist and writer His writing has appeared onAntiwar com, Informed Comment & Digital Resistance and he has appeared on the BBC, Press TV, and Etejah English as an analyst and commentator I can completely see how that makes sense If only, for example,
 the Minister of Transportation in Iraq had been a Sunni Arab then
 the following would ve happened: ISIS would ve realized their dreams of a global caliphate were
 misguided and would ve disbanded Anjem Choudary, the notorious UK hate preacher, would have
 stopped his incendiary statements about Sharia law for the UK Boko Haram would ve handed back all the land they ve seized in
 Northern Nigeria to the army Al Qaeda in the Peninsula wouldn t have launched the attack
 against Charlie Hebdo for publishing their blasphemous cartoons Jamaat e Islami wouldn t have perpetrated the Bali bombings The Pakistani Taliban would stop massacring Shia Muslims, Ahmadis
 and Christians for sport Al Shabaab would ve disbanded in Somalia The list could go on and on and on I am, of course, being
 somewhat facetious and of course the government in Baghdad has
 been an equal opportunity offender, with the towns and cities of
 the Shia south among some of the most deprived areas of the
 country There are many groups who have been marginalized by
 corruption and incompetence in central government, including the
 majority Shia UNDP s 2014 Human Development Index for Iraq paints a different
 picture to the Sunni marginalisation narrativepic twitter com/cSOhbp9EMs î Ali Kadhmawi (@AliKadhmawi)December
 23, 2014 Thus Sunni marginalization doesn t wash as a narrative to
 explain what lies behind ISIS, not when one considers they have
 also targeted Kurds, Christians, Yezidis and even non compliant
 Sunnis they claim to be protecting The actual connection behind all the groups mentioned above, what
 truly links them together is the philosophy underpinning their
 vision That is a growing inclination within Sunni Islam towards
 the Salafi (also referred to as Wahhabi) ideology which has its
 financial and historical roots in Saudi Arabia and the wider
 Arabian Peninsula In the case of the terrorist groups massacring
 Muslims, Christians and anyone else in their way, a particular
 reading of this philosophy is Salafi Jihadism, which sees as its
 end goal the establishment of the aforementioned global
 caliphate Still the marginalization canard persists to justify
 the barbarous rampage of ISIS which includes indiscriminate
 massacres against Shia Muslims, who they regard as heretics It
 is interesting to note that in any other country, such
 equivocation would be shut down in a heartbeat as justifying
 terrorism You can t point to the massive inequality targeting
 French, mainly North African Muslims to try to explain Charlie
 Hebdo, but you can say the Shia deserve to beslaughtered like sheepat Camp Speicher because, you
 know, jobs and stuff There are, of course, several agendas behind this The first is a
 quite shameless attempt by some who supported the invasion and
 occupation of Iraq towash their hands of any responsibilityfor
 it What better way than to blame the locals for the electoral
 system you imposed which has hamstrung repeated Iraqi
 administrations over the past decade, with the over emphasis on
 sect and ethnicity, and the power sharing structure which leads
 to inherently weak and corrupt governments The Shia Arabs form 60 percent of the Iraqi population but have
 shared power with all of Iraq s other minority groups in order to
 keep the peace These groups have played the role of spoilers in
 order to achieve their own respective interests The mainly Sunni
 Kurds have consistently threatened to secede should Baghdad stop
 paying the Kurdish Region its $1 billion welfare check, while the
 Sunni Arabs have drifted between boycotts of the political
 process and terrorism in order to pressure the central government
 for more concessions But as far as US leaders are concerned,
 when the US withdrew from its brutal occupation the message to
 the Iraqis was it s your baby now, you deal with it ù As Shireen T Hunter, a Professor at Georgetown University, states
 in her seminal piece; the exclusion of Iraq s Sunnis from
 leadership posts in Baghdad has been blown out of proportion 
 Western and especially US dislike of Iran has been a major cause
 for the disregarding of mass killings and assassination of
 Shias ù This brings us to the next agenda The Iraqi government has built
 close ties to its Persian neighbor to the east The Islamic
 Republic has supported successive Iraqi administrations, invested
 billions of dollars into the Iraqi economy, helped develop the
 holy shrine cities of Najaf, Karbala and Samarra and,
 particularly since last June,helped Iraqin its war with the so called
 Islamic State In fact numerous Iraqi officials have stated
 thatif it wasn t for Iran, and not the US, ISIS
 would ve been fighting in Baghdad itself and not currently on the
 defensive against the Alliance of Iraqi armed forces, Shia
 militias and local anti ISIS Sunni tribes This alliance which forms part of the broaderresistance axishas presented a huge problem
 for the regional foes of Iran and by extension, their Shia
 allies, both in Iraq and the wider region The first and foremost
 foe is the Israeli regime The Israeli obsession with Iran has
 led to an alliance with the Syrian rebels and in particular theal Qaeda branch in Syria, Jabhat Al Nusra, to
 which even theUN has borne witness Israeli Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the US congress at the invite of the
 republicanparty earlier this month and used his speech to
 excoriate a proposed US Iran deal over Iran s peaceful civilian
 nuclear program His message was that Iran is the major threat to
 world peace and not ISIS He is joined in this assessment by the Sunni monarchies just
 across the Gulf from Iran The Saudi s are also terrified, and
 claim to be under siege as the Islamic Republic, which now wields
 serious influence in Syria to the north, Yemen to the south and
 Iraq to the East Of course, the Saudi sponsorship of radical
 Sunni groups both within Iran s borders and without doesn t seem
 to be a problem or considered meddling bybiased and increasingly sectarianWestern
 policy makers & analysts Saudi money has gone a long way
 towards building this alternative reality, in coordination with
 theirallies in Tel Aviv Human Rights Watch, who
 havesolicited fundsfrom within Saudi Arabia and

 11, 2014 As the volunteers and their allies havemade gainswith Iranian assistance against
 ISIS in Tikrit, the criticism has reached a crescendo with people
 having the audacity to draw equivalence between ISIS on one side
 and those fighting for their very survival on the other While
 Christians and Yezidis are given a chance to repent ù or pay the
 Jizya protection tax to ISIS, Shias are afforded no such luxury 
 They are killed on sight, offered no chance of redemption, while
 ISIS hasvowed to attackthem in their holy cities in
 the heartlands of the South This narrative of victim blaming draws on the most putrid
 sectarian & racist biases and plays into the hands of ISIS
 and its supporters It helps them to justify their unjustifiable
 acts But more importantly, it falls into the context of an
 attempt by two of the world s most horrific regimes in Israel and
 Saudi Arabia to spread an irrational fear of Iranian influence in
 the region It is a narrative that seeks to derail the nuclear

"27 Oct, 2014",Re-elected Dilma wins in a Brazil broken in two,"President Dilma Rousseff of the ruling Worker s Party (PT) was re elected this Sunday in a tight run off against opposition candidate Aecio Neves of the Social Democracy Party of Brazil (PSDB) Sun, sex, samba,
 carnival and at least until the recent World Cup hammering by
 Germany, the land of football ùAnd don t forget vibrant democracy ùEven as it enjoys one of the
 highest soft power quotients around the world, Brazil remains
 submerged by clich√©s Vibrant democracy ùcertainly lived up to its billing in
 this hard fought presidential election Yet another clich√© would
 rule this was the victory of state centric ùpolicies
 against structural reforms ùOr the victory of high social spending ùagainst a pro business ù approach
 which implies business as the privileged enemy of social
 equality Exit clich√©s Enter a cherished national motto: Brazil is
 not for beginners Indeed Brazil s complexities boggle the mind It starts with
 arguably the key, multi layered message a divided country sent to
 winner Dilma Rousseff We are part of a growing middle class We
 are proud to be part of an increasingly less unequal nation But
 we want social services to keep improving We want more
 investment in education We want inflation under control (at the
 moment, it s not) We support a very serious anti corruption
 drive (here s where Dilma s Brazil meets Xi Jinping s China) And
 we want to keep improving on the economic success of the past
 decade Rousseff seems to get the message The question is how she will
 be able to deliver in a continental sized nation suffering from
 appalling education standards, with Brazilian manufacturing
 largely uncompetitive in global markets, and with corruption run
 amok Brazil is now mired in dismal GDP growth of 0 3 percent Just
 blaming the global crisis doesn t cut it; South American
 neighbors Peru at 3 6 percent, and Colombia with 4 8 percent are
 definitely going places in 2014 And yet the numbers are not that shabby Job creation is up 
 Unemployment is down to only 5 4 percent Investment in social
 infrastructure is picking up From 2002 to 2014, the minimum wage
 more than tripled GDP per capita is up, reaching roughly $9,000
 while the 2012 Gini coefficient of social inequality is down Industrial production is back to the same level before the 2008
 financial crisis Brazil paid all its debts to the IMF The
 proportion of debt in relation to GDP is falling reaching only
 33 8 percent in 2013 Workers have more purchasing power and
 even with rising inflation, that mirrors better income
 distribution Social programs have benefited 14 million families roughly 50
 million Brazilians These policies may arguably be derided as too
 little, too late Keynesianism But at least that s a start in a
 nation exploited by immensely ignorant, arrogant and rapacious
 elites for centuries Rousseff s first stint as President may also be blamed for too
 many concessions to big extremely profitable banks in Brazil,
 powerful agribusiness interests and Big Capital What happened,
 in a nutshell, is that the center left Workers Party swung to
 the center and was compelled to make unsavory oligarchic
 alliances The result is that a significant section of its social
 base the metropolitan working class, now heavily indebted to
 sustain its brand new consumer dream ended up flirting with the
 right as a political alternative Add to it the PT s not exactly brilliant management skills True,
 the fight against poverty is a lofty ideal But in such an
 unequal nation, that will take at least until 2030 for really
 serious results Meanwhile, serious planning is in order such
 as building a high speed railway between the two megalopolises,
 Rio and Sao Paulo (the Chinese would do it in a few months) And
 seriously tackling Brazil s oligopolies; banks, corporate media,
 construction/real estate conglomerates, the auto industry lobby Unlike the US and Europe, neoliberalism in Brazil has been
 repeatedly knocked out at the ballot box since 2002, when Lula
 was first elected President As for the social
 democrat ùopposition, there s nothing social, and barely
 democratic, about it The PSDB s pet project is
 turbo neoliberalism, pure and simple Team Neves had everything going for them Their key constituency
 was in fact 60 million mostly angry Brazilian taxpayers over 80
 percent living and working in the wealthier southeastern
 seaboard Life is tough if you are a Brazilian salaried
 professional or the owner of a small and medium enterprise (SME) 
 The tax burden is on a par with the industrialized world but
 you get virtually nothing in return No wonder these irate taxpayers are desperate for decently paved
 roads, urban security, better public hospitals, a public school
 system they can send their children to, and less red tape and
 bureaucracy which add to the nefarious, universally known Brazilian cost ù(as in no value for money) These are
 not Workers Party voters although some of them were What they
 want is galaxies beyond the everyday tribulations of the new,
 large lower middle class created by the social programs first
 implemented by Lula Yet with a mediocre candidate like Neves he even lost in his
 home state, where he was governor neoliberalism does not need
 enemies Neves predictably billed himself as the dragon who would slay
 what Wall Street derides as statism ù cutting
 government spending and liberalizing ùtrade, code for
 privileging corporate US interests At the same time Neves has
 never been able to capture the vote of an overburdened black
 woman in the favelas With Neves, Brazil s future Finance Minister would have been
 Arminio Fraga, a slick operator who, among other things, ran
 high risk funds in emerging markets for George Soros and is also
 a former president of Brazil s Central Bank Some of his
 shenanigans are detailed in More Money than God: Hedge Funds and
 the Making of a New Elite, by Sebastian Mallaby Fraga would have
 been the point man of a Soros inspired government Fraga is the proverbial Wall Street predator With him at the
 Finance Ministry, think J P Morgan controlling Brazil s
 macroeconomic policy The road in fact was already paved by
 PSDB s eminence, former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
 met with key global investors via J P Morgan in New York
 last month Fraga was keen on destroying the Lula and Rousseff
 administrations hyper Keynesian bet on demand ùand
 replace it with supply, via a new capitalist shock ùPredictably, his prescription was amplified by the enormous echo
 chamber of conservative Brazilian media, and drowned everything
 else And as perception is reality, contamination ensued pressuring
 public spending downwards, installing major confusion among
 private investors, and leading Western credit rating agencies to
 confirm the supposed lack of credibility of the Brazilian
 economy Brazil is slowly but surely moving from the semi periphery to
 being closer to the center of the action in international
 relations; because of its own regional geopolitical relevance and
 mostly because of its leading role among the BRICS This is
 happening even as Washington could not give a damn about Brazil 
 or Latin America for that matter US think tank land, ùby the way, abhors BRICS Politically, a victory for the Cardoso/Neves neoliberals a
 ghost of the social democracy they once practiced would have
 thrown Brazilian foreign policy upside down; not only against the
 way the historical winds are blowing, but also against Brazil s
 own national interests As Rousseff argued at the UN last month, Brazil is trying to
 fight a global crisis marked by increasing inequality without
 provoking unemployment and without sacrificing workers jobs and
 salaries As ace economist Theotonio dosSantosstressed, the decadence of the West
 still exerting substantial influence over the Global South via
 their extensive network of collaborators, he also went one up;
 the key fight, as he sees it, is to control Brazilian oil Dos Santos is referring to Brazil s top corporation, Petrobras,
 currently mired in a bribery scandal which must be fully
 investigated that obscures the Holy Grail: the future revenues
 from pre salt ùoil named after the billions of
 barrels of oil capped by a thick layer of salt lying several
 miles below the South Atlantic floor Petrobras plans to invest
 $221 billion up to 2018 to unlock this treasure and expects to
 make a profit even if oil trades around $45 to $50 a barrel Politically, in a nutshell, Rousseff s narrow victory is crucial
 for the future of a progressive, integrated South America It
 will reinvigorate Mercosur the common market of the South as
 well as Unasur the union of South American nations This goes
 way beyond free trade; it s about close regional integration, in
 parallel to close Eurasia integration And starting in 2015, Brazil may be on the road to renewed
 economic expansion again largely boosted by the fruits of pre salt ùand compounded with accelerated building of
 roads, railways, ports and airports That is bound to have a
 ripple effect across Brazil s neighbors As for Washington/Wall Street, the Empire of Chaos is certainly
 not happy and that s a major euphemism, especially after
 betting on thewrong horse, Marina Silva, a sort of Amazon
 rainforest born female counterpart to Obama s change we can
 believe in ùThe fact is, as much as the Brazilian model of
 income distribution is against the interests of big business,
 Brazilian foreign policy is now diametrically opposed to
 Washington s On a lighter note, at least some things will remain the same 
 Like Dilma s diary ù an apocryphal, satirical, ghost
 written take on the President s busy schedule published by top
 Brazilian monthly Piaui, a somewhat local version of The New
 Yorker Here s a typical entry; I watched a whole pirate
 copy of Homeland Awesome! We stayed up late, me and Patriota
 [the former Minister of Foreign Affairs] He found the whole
 thing extremely believable! ù Who said a vibrant democracy ùcan t also be fun?

"12 Aug, 2014",‚ÄãSovereign debt for territory: A new global elite swap strategy,"In recent decades, dozens of sovereign nations have fallen into ever deepening trouble by becoming indebted with the private megabank over world ù for amounts far, far in excess of what they can ever pay back Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Is this due to bankers professional malpractice coupled with
 government mismanagement on a truly grand scale? Or are we seeing
 global power elite long term planners slowly achieving their
 goals? Recurrent sovereign debt crises reflect neither over lending
 mistakes ùby bankers and investors, nor innocence ùon the part of successive governments in deeply indebted nations Rather, it all ties in with a global model for domination driven
 by a system of perpetual national debt which Ihave called The Shylock Model ù As with the tango which requires rhythm and bravado, Argentina is
 again dancing centre stage to global mega bankers financial
 tunes after falling into a new technical default ù Not
 just because the country is unable to pay off its massive public
 debt by heeding the rules of the game ùas written and
 continuously re vamped by global usurers, but now with added
 legal immorality and judicial indecency on the part of New York s
 Second District Manhattan Court presided by Judge Daniel Griesa Griesa has shown no qualms in putting US law at the service of
 immoral parasitic bankers and investors ùsuch as Paul
 Singer of the Elliott/NML Fund and Mark Brodsky of the Aurelius
 Fund The mainstream media inside and outside Argentina refer to these
 parasitic money sloshers ùas vulture funds ù;
 a conceptual mistake because one might then be led to believe
 that other funds and bankers Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citigroup,
 JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, George Soros, Rothschild, Warburg
 are not vultures ùwhen, in fact, the very foundations
 of today s global banking system lie on parasitic pro vulture
 rules and laws coupled with an overpowering lack of moral values Sovereign debts are a major problem in just about every country
 in the world, including the US, UK and EU nations So much so,
 those debts have become a Damocles Swords threatening the
 livelihood of untold billions of workers around the world One often wonders why governments indebt themselves for so much
 more than they can ever hope to pay Here, Western economists,
 bankers, traders, Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel
 laureates and the mainstream media have a quick and monolithic
 reply: because all nations need investment and
 investors ùif they wish to build highways, power plants,
 schools, airports, hospitals, raise armies, service
 infrastructures and a long list of et ceteras, economic and
 national activities are all about But more and more people are starting to ask a fundamental
 common sense question: why should governments indebt themselves
 in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
 mega bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
 and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their
 own local sovereign currency instead? Here is where all the above experts ùgo berserk &
 ballistic, shouting back: Issue currency? Are you crazy??
 That s against the rules & laws ù of economics!!! Issuing
 national sovereign currency to finance the real economy s
 monetary needs leads to inflation and lost jobs and chaos and 
 (puts us nice mega bankers out of a job )!! ùThat s when
 they all gang up into noisy The sky is falling! The sky is
 falling!! ùmode Then you ask them: What happens when countries default on their
 unpayable sovereign debts as they invariably and repeatedly do
 not just in Argentina, but in Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, France,
 Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Portugal, Russia, Bolivia,
 Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and
 Indonesia? Again the voice of the experts ù: Then countries
 must restructure ù their debts kicking them forwards 20, 40 or
 more years into the future, so that your great, great, great
 grandchildren can continue paying them ù Oh, I see! The truth is that countries need public spending to maintain
 their economies resilient and buoyant, their citizens working,
 prospering and happy; their nation states sovereign, strong and
 secure OK: happy, secure and working populations cannot be defined as a
 formula that can be readily integrated into expert ùeconomists spreadsheets However, there s a basic truth that
 should be obvious by now: Finance (which is the virtual world of
 bankers, investments, speculation and usury) should always be
 fully subordinated to the Real Economy (which is the world of
 work, production, buildings, milk & bread and services) All this begs the obvious question: Since governments have a
 natural tendency to overspend and end up getting themselves into
 too much debt, which is the better option then: that their red numbers ù(aka sovereign debt) should
 be owed to themselves; their own nation states (debt in local
 currency that in the last instance can be written off, even if a
 bad bout of inflation cannot be stopped, countries can always
 revamp their currencies as Argentina repeatedly did over the past
 forty years), whereby the whole debt crisis ùbasically
 becomes a short term internal affair (albeit painful!), or to convert those red numbers ùinto foreign currency
 debt (US Dollars or Euro) fully controlled by powerful far away,
 well organized creditor technocrats and global mega bankers
 sitting at the FED and IMF in Washington DC; the European Central
 Bank in Frankfurt; or perched in eager expectation in their Wall
 Street vulture nests? This tongue twister, which famously proved too much for Baby Bush
 to muster, is a fitting description of how the hellish sovereign
 debt system really works in the long term Argentina s recurrent defaults and debt restructuring go back
 many decades For brevity s sake, let s just point to 1956 right
 after President Juan Domingo Per√≥n was ousted by a very bloody
 1955 US UK (and mega banker) sponsored military coup Per√≥n was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina
 with the mega bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all
 of Argentina s sovereign debt So, once the mega bankers got rid
 of him in 1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created
 the Paris Club ùto engineer decades worth of sovereign
 debt for vanquished Argentina, something they ve been doing until
 today But each sovereign debt crisis cycle became shorter, more
 virulent and more toxic By December 2001, Argentina had collapsed financially sinking
 into the largest sovereign debt default in history Immediately,
 the IMF s deputy manager Anne Krueger proposed some new and
 creative ideas ùon what to do about Argentina She published them in 2002 in an article on the IMF s website: Should Countries like Argentina be able to declare
 themselves bankrupt? ù, in which she said that the
 lesson is clear: we need better incentives to bring debtors and
 creditors together before manageable problems turn into
 full blown crises ù, adding that the IMF believes this
 could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy regimes like
 Chapter 11 in the US ù She pointed this out as a possible new approach ù,
 adding that of course many practical and political obstacles
 to getting such an approach up and running ùneeded to be
 overcome, the key features would need the force of law
 throughout the world ù, creating a predictable (global)
 legal framework ù From the stance of global mega bankers geopolitical long term
 planners, Ms Krueger s proposal consisted of first gradually
 driving countries into receivership, and then sequentially into
 full fledged bankruptcy Then as if nations were private corporations like Enron or
 WorldCom they could be broken up into as many digestible ùpieces as possible, to be gobbled up by
 international creditors in some global vulture fest banquet These ideas were developed in greater detail in her IMF essay, A New Approach to Debt Restructuring ù, and in a Foreign Affairs ù(mouthpiece of the powerful New
 York Based Elite think tank, Council on Foreign Relations)
 article published in July/August 2002 by Harvard professor
 Richard N Cooper: Chapter 11 for Countries ù Here, Cooper very matter of factly recommends that only if
 the debtor nation cannot restore its financial health are its
 assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed to its creditors 
 again under the guidance of a (global) court ù(!) During those turbulent years, the global press Time and The New
 York Times, for example even suggested that the immensely rich
 Patagonia southern region should secede from Argentina as a
 defaulted debt payment mechanism In June 2005, however, a new sovereign debt bond mega swap was
 instrumented by Argentina s new president, Nestor Kirchner, and
 his Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna However, as Argentina became more and more structurally mired in
 debt, its sovereign debt crisis cycle grew shorter and shorter so
 that by 2010 a new debt crisis was in the books involving yet
 more debt reengineering, this time by President Cristina Kirchner
 and her Economy Minister (and today prosecuted Vice President)
 Amado Boudou But that too failed to hold for long, and today Singer s
 NML/Elliot Fund and Brodsky s Aurelius Fund have pushed Argentina
 again into default, this time with the legal backing of local
 Manhattan Federal Judge Griesa and the US Supreme Court The very fact that today the fate of Argentina s sovereign debt
 lies with the US Judiciary is an eloquent sign of things to come Surprisingly, Ms Krueger recently came out in defense ùof Argentina recommending Judge Griesa and his Vulture
 Nest ùboys should not act hastily killing off the Argentine
 hen that lays golden eggs In an article published July 2014, she warns that the US
 Supreme Court s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle, and may
 very well further increase the risk attached to holding sovereign
 debt and this, to the cost of issuing it ù The specialized and mainstream media Financial Times, New York
 Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist are also recommending
 Judge Griesa and his vulture chicks to show more restraint
 because in today s delicate post 2008 banking system, a new and
 less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart the global
 elite s plans for an orderly transition towards a new global
 legal architecture ùthat will allow orderly liquidation of
 financially failed states like Argentina Especially if such debt
 were to be collateralized by its national territory (what else is
 left!?) Will yet another sovereign debt bond mega swap be imposed upon
 Argentina, this time with large swathes of its national territory
 especially Patagonia being used as collateral guarantee? That would mean that in a few years time the Shylocks in Wall
 Street and London will do everything they can to yet again push
 Argentina into default, since that would pave the way for them to legally ùtake over its territory cashing in on their
 collateral as compensation ù Remember: usurer Shylock drooled at the mouth whilst sharpening
 his knife preparing to cut deep into Merchant Antonio s heart He
 didn t give a damn about the 3000 ducats owed him: he just wanted
 the pound of flesh legally ùhis Is this what the coming Sovereign Debt Model ùwill look
 like? If we tie this all in with what the unfolding of Act
 III ùin the on goingIsrael Palestine crisiswhereby re settling
 millions of Israeli civilians into southern Argentina might be on
 the drawing board, we can then begin to understand how nicely
 Argentina s next debt crisis will tie in: The global
 Rothschild s, Warburg s, Lazard s, Soros, Rockefellers will be
 able to legally ùtake over Patagonia, and then legally ùhand it over to whomever they wish without a
 single shot being fired! If this is what s really happening behind the curtains regarding
 Argentina, does anybody believe it will stop there? Beware Greece, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Korea,
 Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa the world government is
 marching in!

"26 May, 2014","‚ÄãChina to be the most important country in XXI century - Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment There s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today Follow@SophieCo_RT SS:Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us We re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? JR:Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don t like saying it, since I m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together America is driving Russia more and more to Asia That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington SS:So you re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? JR:Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly As you know, they ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn t think through the consequences Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that s not so unusual what s unusual is that America didn t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day to day basis, so now Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia I m afraid America just didn t think it through, they ve bungled, they ve acted on a day to day basis, and they ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr Obama SS:You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine another embarrassment for the US foreign policies ù Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? JR:That s an extremely good question Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia SS:But if you re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? JR:I didn t say it s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that s not that s good for Russia, that s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners SS:George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? JR:America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to I mean, if we ve sold all of our oil reserves, it s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even But, then the markets it s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn t have anything in reserve, so again, you have to ask him, I don t know, but that doesn t seem like a very viable solution to me SS:But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe will the US be able to fill the gap? JR:No America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe You don t just sort of snap your fingers and do that You don t just put in on a boat or plane, you ve got to have special ports on both sides, you ve got to have special ships, and you ve got to have natural gas in the right place Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe that s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas will they have a surplus in five years? I don t know Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it SS:I don t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? JR:Pay it back to the europeanunion ? No, I doubt it very seriously They re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it I don t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back SS:Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair? I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? JR:Sophie, you re asking extremely good question I don t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play I don t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game I don t see what America expected to get out of it Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would SS:But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? JR:I don t see that it has hurt Russia Maybe there s something I don t know, but I don t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point SS:What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk So where does that leave dollar? JR:Again, I don t particularly like saying this, because I m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar many people now must be saying guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don t like us, they ve going to put sanctions on us! ùSo more and more people would say maybe I shouldn t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn t have my money in US dollars ùAt the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar More and more people are doing the same thing, they re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar This is just a continuing long term move away from the US dollar And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions SS:So, if you re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? JR:The US has been the world s reserve currency, has had the world s medium of exchange and so far we ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say here they are! ù then that cripples America in many many ways The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view Just recently, the space people said every country in the world has eventually collapsed ùand the way America is going, we might collapse too This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things If you read history, Sophie, it s true, it s correct When people do not have the money that they used to have they re limited in many ways You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don t have the money to pay for it anymore, you re in trouble SS:You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? JR:It s a been a long term adage in the investment world that you buy when there s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you re probably going to make a lot of money in the end unless the world comes to an end I don t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy I ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high that s what I m trying to do SS:Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now JR:I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I ll tell you I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine You don t buy something just because it s low because it can get lower and lower and lower I d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it s going to continue to be in turmoil If you ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10 15 years you know what I m talking about Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now SS:So what are you thinking how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? JR:I would suspect that it s going to America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said No, we re not going to do this anymore, we don t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia ù Europeans don t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it s doing nothing It doesn t hurt the Russians doesn t seem to There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don t suspect that this is going to last much longer SS:Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you re looking at non energy companies Is it right? JR: I have plenty of energy investment, so I m not investing in energy companies in Russia I m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy SS:Well, that s what I was going to ask you what do you invest in, in Russia? JR:I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares I own shares of the Moscow s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I m looking for other areas to invest I don t have any others yet, but I m looking SS:Look, I ve got a sense from what you re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia Is that s how it works, exactly? JR:I said, if there are more sanctions ù Washington keeps saying they re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will That s what they say they re going to do, they probably will do it And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while I have no idea of what s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak But it often does SS:Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well known basic strategy but you re not afraid for the long term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? JR:No, of course My point about sanctions is that they don t seem to be hurting Russia, I don t see that there s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don t go along with them, or don t go along with them in a big way I don t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short term It s just that I don t see it SS:With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? JR:Yes I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you ve probably know Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren t very viable, that they haven t hurt Russia in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they re doing more business with China China is a pretty successful economy, so it s not hurting, and in some ways it s actually helping Russia, because it s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals It s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars SS:Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let s say, during your lifetime? JR:During my lifetime? SS:Yep JR:Well, I hope I ll live a long time, Sophie, so yes I hope I ll live a long, long time SS:Well, we hope too But tell me one more thing: do you think there s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? JR:Oh, I m sure we will If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they re going to take advantage of it So, no, it s happening SS:You have said that you re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center you really think it has what it takes? JR:No, what I ve said was that I m astonished that they think that, that they re going to try I don t know if they can make that Mr Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center I m astonished I ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive Whether it works or not in 10 15 years? I don t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center SS:Talking about 10 15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age Is that where the future is, in China? JR:In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world SS:Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? JR:Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life I ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years I do think I see opportunities and therefore I m investing SS:So when did you first come to Russia? JR:I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years I knew I wouldn t work But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I ve started investing in Russia SS:So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? JR:No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn t as bad as it had been for 46 years SS:I want to ask one more question about China I m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn t suffered any crises yet But, it might at some point, like all markets do so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? JR:Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it s going to affect some people If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering That s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now It s just like if America has problems; it affects a lot of people If Japan has problems, it affects some people So there is no question that China will have problems I don t know what, or when, or why but every country has problems, somewhere along the line What is a little bit unusual is that it s been a long time since China has had major problems That is extremely unusual That s one reason I m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I m waiting in case there s a problem coming out of China If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I m smart enough to buy more china SS:Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/161436-china-russia-investment-rogers/
"30 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãGulf toil?,"US Saudi relations have long been grounded in an oil for security exchange But with U S dependence on Middle Eastern oil diminishing and Saudi power rising, is there a growing gulf in the Gulf? Has the US spat with Russia affected this relationship, and could it lead to a change in the Syrian deadlock? Oksana is joined by Dr David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, to drill into these issues WATCH: https://www r tdotco m/shows/worlds apart oksana boyko/http://www youtube com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart President Obama spoke a lot about the good and bad ways of doing geopolitics this week a rhetoric intended for European and possibly Russian ears that was all but brushed aside when he landed in Saudi Arabia How is it that American values seem to depreciate every time the Saudis are involved? To discuss that, I m now joined by David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Dr Weinberg, thank you very much for taking time to talk to us David Weinberg:Thank you for having me OB:Now, the organisation you work for was set up after 9/11 to promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism ù Is there any country that is more antithetic to all those objectives than Saudi Arabia? DW:Sure, Syria, Iran, lots of countries But certainly there s a big gap between the values of the US and the values of the Saudis It s a relationship that s been strained by the conflicting values of the two sides OB:But my question was whether Saudi Arabia really takes the cake for essentially lacking all the three elements that are mentioned in the purposes of the organisation that you work for Again, there is not much in the way of pluralism, they don t value democracy at all, and when it comes to the ideology espoused by Saudi Arabia not only it condones terrorism, it actually supports it DW:Yeah, I mean look, dictatorship is not a contest, but if it were, the Saudis would be doing great My organisation has actually been quite active on this issue For instance, this week we put out a report highlighting the hate that is continually, still being taught in Saudi Arabia s public schools through their textbook system So, we certainly are no friends of the Saudis on this issue, and we certainly hope that the President had some very serious conversations about human rights behind closed doors, while he was in Saudi Arabia OB:Well this is a very mild way of putting it But Saudi Arabia is not officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism And yet it is well known that it is the largest source of financing when it comes to militant jihadi groups such as the Taliban or Al Qaeda And I hardly need to mention that it is Americans who suffered a great deal from the terror plots hatched, and sometimes executed with the help of Saudi money Fifteen out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals And when you think about it, had they been Russians, I think we could have had an outbreak of World War III by now But with the Saudis, again, it s always let s be patient with them ù And it may be a personal question, but for a country like Russia, which often finds itself on the receiving end of US condemnation without hurting a single American, it s very difficult to understand why would Americans let the Saudis off the hook so easily, given how many Americans were hurt in 9/11? DW:Absolutely Well, you know, I think it s reflected, first of all, in public opinion numbers Saudi Arabia has absolutely dreadful numbers when you as the American public what they think of the other country But when you say Saudi money going to sponsor terrorism, I m curious whether you mean state money going to sponsor terrorism, or whether you mean private money going to sponsor terrorism? Which do you mean? OB:Well Dr Weinberg, I mean both Because obviously, there are some private sponsors of terror groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Lebanon They used to sponsor insurgency in Chechnya as well But official government structures in Saudi Arabia are not the most transparent, so you can never be sure that official money is not being used for the same purpose DW:But is there evidence of official money? I don t think so OB:Well, I think Prince Bandar, for one, is quite involved in sponsoring various rebel groups in Syria And I guess we can argue about the definition of terrorism and freedom fighting, but I think it is pretty clear that Saudi Arabia is supporting groups that use terror as a tactic in Syria So, that would be, sort of, evidence, wouldn t it? DW:Sure, I mean I think that some of Saudi Arabia s identified clients in Syria are extremely unappealing For instance, the extremist group most convincingly tied to Saudi governmental assistance is called Jaysh al Islam, or the Army of Islam, which is led by a man called Zahran Alloush, whose father is a preacher in Saudi Arabia, and who advocates ethnic cleansing of Shiites and opposes democracy This is an organisation that by and large is repulsive and antithetical to western values, and it s an organisation that the US has been, to my understanding, pushing the Saudis behind the scenes to reduce their support for OB:You just mentioned how little support there is for the Saudis and their tactics among the American public And yet American politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, seem to be sort of welcoming, or at least tight lipped, when it comes to criticism of the Saudi officials Why do you think that is? DW:Well, I think we need to differentiate between the executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue Because, I think the legislative branch has been quite comfortable raising concerns about Saudi policies that conflict with universal human rights and democratic values So for instance, members of Congress for both parties, in the last week and a half, have issued letters to the President, calling on him to make human rights part of the discussion, and to make religious freedom part of the discussion when he went to Saudi Arabia So I do think that American politicians of both stripes, be it Democratic or Republican, are not reluctant to speak out about this issue But I do think that when either party is in power at the White House, they certainly have incentives to try elicit regional cooperation from the Saudis, and unfortunately sometimes that means human rights reform issues get kicked a little bit lower on the priority list Just as that sometimes is the case in US relations with Russia American officials would actually like to be raising these issues even more often than they do with Russia, but because of Russia s important role as a geopolitical power, don t even raise it as much as they actually would, as surprising as that may be for some of your viewers to hear OB:But Dr Weinberg, I wonder how much more often those issues could be raised? Because I think human rights in Russia is one of the most popular issues for American politicians, whether of the executive or legislative branch But going back to Saudi Arabia, President Obama has just visited Riyadh What do you think he was hoping to achieve there? DW:Well I think the messaging coming out of the White House really focused on trying to dispel the image that there s a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United States So even as the President s plane was pulling into Saudi Arabia, his deputy national security advisor was giving a briefing to the press corps, and he was trying to emphasise that things have gotten better in the US Saudi relationship since the fall, when the Saudis were upset So, not denying that the Saudis have been upset with the US, but trying to argue that that dispute over Iran, over Syria, over other issues, has been resolved or at least significantly reduced As to whether that narrative is going to be seen as persuasive, either by the media or the general public, we still have yet to see OB:Now the biggest strain, as many analysts have identified, in this bilateral relationship is Americas reluctance to fully back the Saudis in their existential fight against the Shia forces of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, possibly Iraq And this fight that the Saudis are in is not driven by money, it is not driven by political calculations It is driven by genuine values, however archaic and bigoted they may be And I wonder, given the existential nature of this fight, whether Americans can really reason with the Saudis at this point, or is it increasingly a case of the tail wagging the dog here DW:Well, I certainly would agree with you with regard to your argument that this is an area where the US really has some difficulties satisfying the Saudis fully You know, the Saudi public sees what s going on in Syria as the greatest humanitarian calamity of our age And that s not my words, that s the Saudi Foreign Minister s words And so what they see are Shiites, whom they already have dehumanised in their education and religious system as heretics, slaughtering Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, slaughtering Sunni civilians as well as rebels And so, in that regard, the Saudis want the US to decapitate the regime in Syria, at the very least by toppling it And so the Saudis are not going to be satisfied when they see the US pursuing an approach that actually, in some regards on the battlefield, is quite similar to Russia s strategy, which is to have this conflict turn into a stalemate The Russians want to enable Assad to not be toppled, to outlast the conflict And the US wants to ensure, like Russia purportedly, a political solution to this conflict, by ensuring that the rebels are not fully marginalised on the battlefield But when it comes to actually toppling the Assad regime militarily, the US administration has held back to some extent until now And we ll just have to see whether the Saudis can convince them to take a harder line on this It certainly could happen, especially if there s no progress at Geneva OB:Since you mentioned Russia s intentions in Syria, I think Russia would much have preferred not having this conflict to begin with I think this conflict was initiated and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US to begin with So it is those two countries that actually opted for changing the status quo But rather than going in depth into Syria, I would like to ask you very quickly this relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was founded on a quite explicit agreement that Washington would defend the Gulf state in exchange for oil contracts And the US no longer needs that much Saudi oil, and the nature of security threats has also changed So I wonder if it s possible that, sooner or later, the US and Saudi Arabia will have to part ways? DW:Well, first of all, I d like to address something that you said right before your question, which is how this conflict started As Americans see it, the way this conflict started was a Russian supported dictator, Bashar al Assad, slaughtered his people when they went out on the street and peaceably demonstrated As well as arresting and torturing teenagers So that is how we see how this conflict started As to whether the US and the Saudis OB:Well, you see this conflict this way because you are told that this conflict started this way As somebody who was on the ground in Syria, all those three years ago, I can tell you that there were snipers, there were provocation, there were Saudi agents there on the scene So obviously the tactics of Bashar al Assad are not to be defended, and his indiscriminate use of force But I wonder if the US would react in any different way if the constitutional law and order were threatened? For once, if I can remind you of the search operation for the Boston bombers, if you remember a couple of years ago The whole city of Boston was blocked to find two men, police was used and he was shot dead So, I think Americans use force quite extensively when their own security is compromised, but they for some reason deny that right to other countries But I would still like you to answer that question about whether you see any chance for the US and Saudi Arabia parting ways geopolitically, given how different their value systems really are? DW:Well, having lived in Boston, having actually lived on the same block as the Boston bomber, having been a graduate student at MIT in the past where a police officer was slaughtered by the bombers no doubt Americans take terrorism seriously As to whether the Saudis and the US are going to part ways, the triumphalism of the shale energy boom to some extent is overwrought Because the US, just as Russia, just as other countries are in the global economy, are dependant on stability in the global price of oil And in that regard, until industrialised countries such as the US, such as Russia, such as the countries of east and south Asia, have fuel choice about the fuel they put in their automobiles, we re going to be continually dependant on the security in the Gulf OB:I see Dr Weinberg, we have to take a short break now, but when we come back the United States has rediscovered its good old enemy in Russia What does this mean for the future of US Saudi relations? That s coming up in a few moments on Worlds Apart OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the love hate relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia with David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies DW:That s a great way of putting it OB:Dr Weinberg, you just heard, I turned it in terms of love and hate, and I m not sure about the love, but to see the examples of hatred, all you need to do is to open the Saudi school textbooks, which you alluded to earlier, that for decades have been spewing vitriol at everything Western And as you mentioned, you wrote a very interesting report recently on how lenient the US has been recently with Saudi Arabia on this issue But I wonder, what is the real reason for Saudi procrastination in removing all those vitriolic passages from their textbooks? DW:Well, first of all, I d like to say that I don t think that the US has been uniquely lax when it comes to raising Saudi textbooks In fact, I think it s done more than any other government in its exchanges with the Saudi authorities on this issue For instance, I saw no indication that this was part of the conversation when Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin met last year in Moscow So I think there are things that other countries could do That having been said, the US has more leverage that it could potentially use with Saudi Arabia on this issue And in that regard, I really do with the US would do more OB:Well Dr Weinberg, the reason why President Putin may not raise this issue, or other issues, with foreign visitors is because Russia doesn t make the promotion of democracy the pillar of its foreign policy It s the US that does And if I m not mistaken, the State Department first noted a problem with the Saudi textbooks all the way back in 2003 And ever since then, the Saudis have assumed this very typical approach for them of not saying no outright, but not delivering either And my question to you is whether they see any practical gain in essentially indoctrinating their youth in this mindset, whether they do it on purpose as a part of state ideology? DW:Well, I think Saudi Arabia, like any country, does have some internal debates, even as an absolute monarchy But that having been said, I do think that the Saudi authorities bear responsibility for what s in these books, especially because these books are printed on an annual basis by their Ministry of Education So they are to blame for what s published in their texts The Saudi monarch, and the Saudi royal family, and the government say that these books have been reformed, that they re being improved But when they say that, they only take the lowest hanging fruit They take some of the hatred out of elementary school books They say that they spent money on teacher training, to moderate teachers They say that they re increasing the number of women in universities But the reason that they don t take this on more seriously, I think, is because they see more benefit in not upsetting their conservative, reactionary preachers, than they see in telling their children a more tolerant view of the world and keeping their children from being indoctrinated So I do think that it really will take diplomatic consequences in Saudi Arabia s foreign relations with the international community for this to change OB:Now, this violent extremism that children are being taught in Saudi public schools is bad when it is targeted at you, but when it targets some of your rivals, it may come in handy And here I would like to shift gears a little bit and discuss the Saudi US relations vis a vis Russia, because there are quite a few historic examples when this partnership was very successful in undermining Moscow I wonder whether these recent tensions that we saw between Russia and the West, and the US in particular, could lead President Obama to re evaluate or rethink his relationship with Saudi Arabia DW:Actually, I think US Russian relations in the last month have added an extra strain to to the US Saudi relationship Because the Saudis wish that the US had been firmer with Russia over the Crimea Just as they saw the US choosing to pursue a negotiated deal with Russia over Syria s chemical weapons in the fall, this was an area where US, Russia I d like to say at least averting away from more direct conflict actually came at some cost to the US in its relationship with the Saudis Similarly, the US helped turned the tide of the battle in Afghanistan in the 80s, against the Soviet Union, by introducing a large number of MANPADS man portable air defence systems that the Mujahiddeen used against the Soviet air force The US hasn t gotten much credit from the Russians for something that they ve done, which is showing some restraint when it comes to MANPADS in Syria today The Saudis have been itching to introduce those in massive numbers, unsupervised, without any sort of permissive action links, without any sort of way for the US, for instance, to disable them if they fall in the hands of Al Qaeda But the US has actually held relatively firm on that to date, and that s an area in which the US hasn t gotten much credit OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, I think this is a very novel interpretation of both recent events in history Because if it wasn t for the US and Saudi Arabia, those weapons wouldn t be in Syria in the first place So I don t see how we can credit the US for not restraining Saudi Arabia well enough Going back to Ukraine, there have been reports that Washington has already reached out to Saudi Arabia to provide some of the $15 billion promised to Ukraine And while Saudi Arabia doesn t have any intrinsic interest in Ukraine, what it is interested in is seeing Washington toughen up on Syria And I wonder if we could see any sort of Ukraine for Syria swap here essentially Saudi Arabia giving the money for Ukraine, but Washington in return doing what Riyadh wants it to do in Syria? DW:You know, actually the most persuasive tit for tat of this sort that I ve seen has been a recent story in the Washington Post, suggesting that the US is finally considering doubling its training of vetted Syrian rebels, to be funded by the Qatari treasury So if there s going to be a tit for tat, in this regard, that s actually where I ve seen some suggestions that it might happen OB:Now, Russia is a natural rival for the US in Ukraine, and for Saudi Arabia in Syria so much so that George Soros has already suggested that the two team up in driving the oil prices down And of course, this move proved to be very effective back in the 80s, when these two countries colluded in driving the oil prices down, and that proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union Do you think that could work this time around? DW:No, I don t think there s persuasive US Saudi collusion on the energy price that actually influences Saudi energy policy The Saudis make their oil production decisions based on internal budgetary issues, and they do this also by looking at the domestic situation in Saudi Arabia and making outlays to keep their public quiet So that, I think, is actually going to be the biggest driver of Saudi oil policy But, you know, they can be hypocritical about this too, just as the US can be hypocritical about where and when it supports democracy, just as Russia can be hypocritical about where and when it supports sovereignty OB:I wonder if we could consider one more way of how the Saudis and Americans could exact their vengeance, or their revenge on Russia, and that would be by supporting terror groups They used to do that in Chechnya, as I mentioned before, and they could probably do the same in Crimea, which has a somewhat sizeable population, couldn t they? DW:Well actually, the Muslim population in Crimea is significantly smaller before Stalin ethnically cleansed the place So actually, I think that leverage is much smaller now OB:But, just fore the benefit of our viewers, as far as I know, I may be mistaken but back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Crimea was a very popular destination for wounded Chechen rebels First, because of the geographic proximity to Chechnya, and also because of the somewhat lax security policy of the Ukrainian authorities I think it is estimated that at the moment, there are around 5,000 followers of the Wahhabi branch of Islam in the Crimea, and I guess you wouldn t need even that many to stir trouble? DW:Well, you know, first of all it is important to distinguish between people s religious views, be they intolerant or not, and whether they re actually engaged in acts of violence But certainly I do think that when an intolerant brand of religion is promoted in places abroad, including in elements of the Soviet Union, there are consequences for that down the road, absolutely OB:Well one of the natural consequences for Moscow would be to deepen its ties with Tehran, especially given the very politically correct reaction of the Rouhani government to Crimea s joining Russia But I wonder if that will deepen the trenches even more in this geopolitical rivalry? DW:It s absolutely possible, but I do think it conflicts with what the Rouhani government s strategy is in Iran, which is a little bit different than what the Supreme Leader s strategy is in Iran The Supreme Leader s strategy is direct confrontation with the US The Rouhani government s strategy is to maintain many of the Islamic republic s policies, but to try and achieve some sort of rapprochement with the international community They may not be ready to pay the cost of what that entails, and they ve given no indication that they re ready to stop the IRGC s terrorist activities in places like the Levant and the Gulf And that s actually what motivates the Saudis to push hard when it comes to Iran issues, and something that the US, personally I think, could be doing a little more on Certainly Russia could do more on it as well OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, unfortunately we have to leave it there, I appreciate your being on the show DW:Thank you, Oksana OB:And to our viewers keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and I hope to see you again same place, same time here on Worlds Apart RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/usa-saudi-russia-relations-165/
"28 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIntellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ] The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia This has been the colorrevolution s that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments It s not something that comes as a surprise to me SS:You ve mentioned Georgia and orangerevolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s SS:You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another prot√©g√© of that whole Shachtmanite issues You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations SS:But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years SS:The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the orangerevolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent ù SR:I absolutely agree The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned ù or gotten out of control ù it s a fine line There are individuals who are very well trained These NGOs operate on every level They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier because the patrols are less likely it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia Herzegovina is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the europeanunion has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time SS:With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? ù What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing SS:If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp of ¶ and there s a lot of money that comes with that There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders it comes with the good price tag SS:So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your money ¶NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative SS:If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either Let s say that NATO does want to come in they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies ¶because NATO won t come in as a state, run only ¶you know, europeanunion will have to come alongside it So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it I think the Western economy is poison SS:You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that ¶ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic That s the problem that I have with this You talk about hegemony the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance SS:What about these sanctions that the U S and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success They would slow down the amount of success that they are having The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the europeanunion , and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia ¶you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time SS:But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany ¶ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise SS: ¶It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, ù how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the europeanunion I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine SS:If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"14 Mar, 2014",'Britain‚Äôs being relegated to lowest tier in EU‚Äô - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near death state of Ukrainian finances but doesn t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it s great to have you with us today I m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously the EU s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine ù Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them how and why? Bill Cash:I m very much in favor of political cooperation, I m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious It would have been far better if it had been a lower key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was misconceived ùand he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I ll just quote from it: This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits ùIn retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn t been so ambitious I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely na√Øve I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation SS:But what about now, Mr Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it s on the brink of bankruptcy can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is No ù, and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this because when they say 35 billion ùyou can usually add quite a lot more The fact is that proportionately, we re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt SS:But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won t end up in the new elite s pockets? BC:Well, that s a very important question It could apply to almost any country of the EU The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years so the probability of the money getting astray is very very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption That is well known Quite frankly, we don t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don t think the money is there to pay for it SS:Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don t know What I do know is that there are very big questions here I mean, I m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well negotiated answer to these problems I m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years SS:Keeping in mind everything you ve said right now, Mr Cash and talking about being realistic what do you think about Ukraine s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries I m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said we should be associated, but not absorbed ù, and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U S and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating SS:Yeah, but it doesn t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break I m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U S diplomats which openly dismiss the EU s efforts in Ukraine should the EU swallow its pride and follow America s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the europeanunion must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy I m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU It is just simply a complete mess, and I don t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy SS:The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I ve seen the regulations in question In fact, I m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you ù, and given the fact that everyone is saying there won t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very very bad situation When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better SS:Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don t regard the EU as having its own money as such it s a way of interpreting the situation When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it As far as I m concerned, it s our money and I m very glad we re getting it back again I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself SS:Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem As one EU official put it, the scale of it is breathtaking ù Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking I may say that I wouldn t exonerate any country, I don t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world It s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy It s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts All I can say is that it has to be dealt with The court of Auditors of the EU do their best We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly every year I ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn t been signed off, as far as I m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether SS:Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don t think that the consequences and this is a very large subject of majority voting and co decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically I don t think that s healthy, as I ve said in Germany itself, I don t think it s healthy for Germany and I don t think it s healthy for Europe as a whole SS:Now you ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two tier Europe which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I ve said over this, over the last 20 years there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time SS:Talking about great democracy and protecting it you ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I ve just said By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy SS:But, here s another thing You ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream what s changed? BC:Well, I think that s the recognition that it didn t work It has taken a very very long time People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right not with any great self satisfaction, because as far as I m concerned, it s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s SS:Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land mass Unlike France it is a relatively small land mass And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded I am actually not in principle against immigration I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen But, by the same token, there have to be limits An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain s membership of the EU That s it for this edition of the Sophie&Co, we ll see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/british-mp-eu-problems-738/

 from US hardliners with their you re either with us or
 against us rhetoric A decade ago Iraq was branded a rogue state ; today, moderate estimates speak of an Iraqi
 death toll of 500,000 since the 2003 invasion and civil
 war Iraq is clearly the most famous rogue state, if we are to believe
 the two Bushes, especially the junior George, who rammed into
 that country in 2003, all but destroying it, maiming its people
 and proud 3,000 year old heritage † All based on an outright
 lie: the infamous weapons of mass destruction they were accused
 of hiding, but that were never found In those days of hysterical mainstream media warmongering George
 W , Tony Blair and their henchmen had their way, bombing the
 country to smithereens A decade on, we learn from areportjust published in the Public Library of
 Science Medicine Journal that, based on household samplings, an
 estimated 500,000 men, women and children have been killed since
 the invasion A moderate estimate, since others go significantly higher Take
 The Lancet, one of the world s oldest medical journals, which
 published two peer reviewed studies, the latest in 2006 putting
 the figure in excess of 650,000 Or ORB (Opinion Research
 Business) an independent polling agency in London, which in 2007
 published a study estimating total Iraqi war fatalities between
 2003 and 2007 at over 1 2 million All because Bush, Blair and their allies got it all wrong ù about
 Saddam s WMD s: We never found em, ùsaid George
 W , who then went on to joke about the whole affair during a
 White House dinner in March 2004 Clearly, blatant genocide and war crimes committed by the West s
 top leaders in broad daylight over which nobody seems to be
 responsible No one was ever made accountable; no one ever
 bothered to apologize to Iraq or to the world I guess they ve all been too busy going after and smokin out 
 other rogue states like Syria, where the civil war against the
 legal government of Bashar Assad that is being waged by US, UK,
 French, Saudi and Israeli backed/trained/financed terrorists
 (including Al Qaeda offshoot Al Nusra Front) has already cost
 over 120,000 Syrian deaths, mostly civilian Then there was Libya in 2011, where interim democratic 
 government estimates speak of as many as 30,000 dead, including
 the execution of Muammar Gaddafi and many of his family members
 and government officials God only knows how many were actually
 shot, bombed, and lynched like Gaddafi by the NATO backed
 freedom fighters there Add to this the impossible to calculate number of dead, maimed
 and murdered during the Western Powers engineered Arab
 Spring throughout the Arab World over the past three years,
 plus the decades long Palestinian tragedy at the hands of their
 Israeli run Concentration Camp Kommandants, and we re talking
 about many millions of deaths which begin to echo the so, so
 oft repeated 6 million figure So be careful, world! † Make sure your country s not branded
 a rogue state , because if it is, then you re in for a
 lot of trouble! First of all, the term more importantly, the concept was made
 popular during the Clinton Administration It was formally
 introduced by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in 1994 when
 then National Security Advisor Anthony Lake published a report in
 CFR journal Foreign Affairs, claiming the reality of
 recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain
 outside the family [of democratic nations] but also assault its
 basic values ù In typical self righteous US ranting, he then went on to label
 North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Iran as rogue states That
 initial list grew with time to include Sudan, Afghanistan,
 Somalia, Serbia, Montenegro, Venezuela all backed by PsyWar
 name calling like Axis of Evil , Outposts of
 Tyranny and Terrorist States But, to understand what a rogue state is, we first need to
 understand what a rogue state is not in today s world according
 to the US/UK/EU/Israel Let s begin by describing the four things that every country must
 do in order not to be branded a rogue state by the global
 hegemons: 1) General behavior: Every nation must maintain unconditional and
 unflinching alignment to the present world order controlled and promoted by the global powers that are embedded
 deep inside key Western military powers, notably the US If a nation heeds, obeys, acclaims, pays tribute and is
 subservient to the on going economic, financial, political,
 historical and cultural world outlook and order, and remains
 passive whilst the global powers prepare the coming new world
 order whether under the guise of the Western
 democracies , or globalization , or the
 international community or, soon to come, World
 Government then you re OK If, however, a nation dares defy any aspect of this, it will soon
 find itself slipping fast into rogue state mode That s
 what happened to Saddam in 1990 after he invaded Kuwait without
 first getting the proper green light from the US; that s
 what happened to Argentina s pro US military junta in 1982 when
 General Galtieri tried to take back the Falkland Islands from
 Britain without Washington s OK 2) Specific behavior: Then, every nation must maintain
 unconditional alignment to specific US/UK/EU/Israel dictated special interests involving the country and its region 
 This naturally varies from country to country and fluctuates as
 specific interests of the hegemon evolve † Some examples: ¢ Egypt: Total alignment to Israel and its geopolitical
 interests That was quite a historical somersault for Gamal
 Nasser s country to make, considering that for decades Egypt
 spearheaded Arab opposition to the West s imposing of Israel on
 Palestinian territory Hosni Mubarak was their man who for 32
 years kept Egypt on course until † Until he
 stupidly breached condition No 3 (see below) ¢ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain:
 Keep the oil flowing, be nice to our oil companies and to Israel,
 and your leaders can do whatever else they like (see 4, below) ¢ Argentina: Never, ever launch a proper investigation into the
 country s decades old mostly illegitimate even illegal public
 debt rooted in the 1976 1983 US backed military regime Because if Argentina were to do that it could then declare huge
 chunks of it as odious debt suing the mega bankers in
 US/EU courts Such table turning would make Goldman Sachs,
 Citigroup, JPMorganChase, HSBC, the IMF/WorldBank/FED and vulture
 funds really angry One other thing: now that your 30 year old
 democracy has destroyed Argentina s armed forces and sunk the
 country into unprecedented decadence, don t even think of making
 a policy U turn Keep all of this going and your leaders too can
 do whatever else they like (see 4, below) 3) Internal control & credibility: However, if a nation s
 leadership behaves nicely , yet cannot control its own
 population and maintain domestic credibility, then like it or
 not, we re going to have to replace you † And if you don t
 like it, well, they will just make you an offer you can t a Hosni Mubarak of Egypt: When the Tahrir Square uprising began
 he proved unable to maintain order and credibility It turned out
 that 32 years is just too long stay in power even with US money
 and support, so out the window he went When Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton visited Egypt in March 2011 to make sure
 Egypt gets the kind of democracy that we want to see, ùMuslim
 Brotherhood president Morsi was not what she had in mind, so he
 too went out the window thanks to a US backed military coup Aren t military coups supposed to be done by undemocratic
 SOB s? † Yes, but as President Franklin Roosevelt once
 famously said of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, he may
 be an SOB, but he s our SOB! ù b Fernando de La R√∫a of Argentina: Elected in 1999, he was 110
 percent compliant with (1) and (2) above, however he was most
 inept in the way he bled the country so it would pay its pound of
 flesh to international mega bankers His internal credibility and
 grip collapsed and Fernando was forced to escape aboard his
 chopper from the roof of the Casa Rosada presidential palace into
 oblivion, as his police killed and beat up protesters on the
 Plaza de Mayo square below Twelve years on, with Argentina s democracy about to
 celebrate its 30th anniversary, its present political managers
 are again losing grip: a new bout of spares and replacements 
 are thus needed, and you can bet your bottom dollar that they
 have been identified and are being positioned to become
 Argentina s soon to come new government Just make sure
 that they too continue being serial debt payers to the
 global mega bankers as president Cristina Kirchner recently
 described her and her husband s more than 10 year tenure in
 power 4) Corruption galore: The global powers message to all national
 political leaders: as long as you fully perform and comply with
 (1), (2) and (3) above, you can sink your grubby hands into all
 the money you want The message is clear: perform as we need you
 to perform on the above key issues, and we don t really care if
 you steal millions, hundreds of millions or even billions from
 your own people, whether by imposing endemic poverty on the local
 population or as outright theft CitiCorp, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros, Goldman Sachs, US
 Treasury, the IMF & World Bank couldn t care less if Mubarak,
 Berlusconi, Rajoy, Fujimori, Menem, Calder√≥n, Lula and Kirchner
 steal from their own people If they can get away with it whilst
 maintaining their local credibility and grip, it s just not an
 issue If anything it s an added asset for the elite, because
 should such local leaders misbehave , they can then be
 easily blackmailed out of power That, in a nutshell, is how the global powers exert control over
 whole countries and regions by ensuring their chosen local
 managers are placed at the helm of national governments to do
 the elites dirty work for them As long as these leaders behave
 and perform properly they can stay on for decades just like
 Hosni Mubarak If they misbehave or their useful lives expire, they re
 then quickly shown the exit and shoved out the door When their
 crimes and thefts are publicly exposed their own local
 populations will do the kicking out for them Saddam was so useful during the eight year war of attrition
 against Iran in the 80s (Iran was Ronald Reagan s original rogue
 state), even Don Rumsfeld shook Saddam s hand and gave him
 chemical WMD s to use against Iran s Ayatollahs After Kuwait,
 however, Ronnie s Veep the Elder Bush gave Saddam quite a
 thrashing, but he didn t learn his lesson So Baby Bush taught
 him good in 2003 Sure, it s not all that simple: each country has its own
 characteristics, its own problems, its own usefulness for the
 global powers In fact, each country is a testing ground and a
 learning ground, the lessons of which are later put to good use
 in other countries and regions So, nations of the world: you ve been warned When walking
 amongst fierce beasts, make sure you do so quietly, cautiously
 and discreetly Be not too defiant lest you too are branded a rogue state Then
 you ll be in real trouble! Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

"26 Aug, 2013",The world according to the global power brokers,"When the World Economic Forum released its 2013 Global Risks Report earlier this year, it included an interesting array of proposals which should raise eyebrows and be taken very seriously Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi Adrian Salbuchi is an international political analyst, researcher and consultant Author of several books on geopolitics in Spanish and English (including The Coming World Government: Tragedy & Hope ), he is also a conference speaker in Argentina and radio/TV commentator He writes op ed pieces for RT Spanish as well as RT English, and is a regular guest on alternative media radio and TV shows in the US, Europe and Latin America Adrian currently hosts his TV show Segunda Rep√∫blica on Channel TLV1 Toda La Verdad Primero in Buenos Aires, and is founder of the Second Republic Project (Proyecto Segunda Rep√∫blica), a sovereign governance model for Argentina, Latin American countries and elsewhere His website is:www asalbuchi com ar;YouTube channel:www youtube com/user/arsalbuchi The World Economic Forum (WEF) used risk management exercises to
 address many of the challenges that we all know about growing
 social and political violence, the West s on going financial
 collapse, food and water shortages, and the Elite s all time
 favorite global terrorism ù However, they also worked out proposals for government ùand some rather uncanny X Factors ùwhich, coming as they
 do from one of the global powers favorite think tanks, we would
 do well to read between the lines As German playwright Johann W Goethe once remarked, coming
 events cast their shadows forwards ù This is particularly
 true when those shadows are cast by global power brokers in a
 position to drive and control those coming events, according to
 their hearts desire, and here we are talking about the World
 Economic Forum (WEF), founded in 1971 Chaired by Klaus Schwab,
 who sits on David Rockefeller s Trilateral Commission, means he
 has direct access to the families of Rockefeller, Bush, Soros,
 Kissinger, Brzezinski, Rothschild, Lazard, Harriman, Montbatten,
 Warburg, Schiff, Borb√≥n, and Orange Indeed, it is from behind these curtains that the global elite
 are planning to impose a world government on all mankind; by
 designing, planning, and executing the macro changes that they
 need to impose upon all countries each according to need and in
 their due time as the process of privatizing global power rams
 forwards on a global scale Two interesting issues are being highlighted by the elite through
 the WEF: the re engineering of national governments, and the
 introduction of so called X Factors ùinto the collective
 psyche Subtitled Lessons Learned from around the World; Global
 Agenda Council on the Future of Government ù, this WEF piece
 written in 2011 echoes the Council on Foreign Relations academic,
 Richard Gardner s seminal essay written almost forty years ago on
 the hard road to the new world order ù, where he
 recommended sovereign Nation states should be eroded piece by
 piece ù This Report urges governments to align to the future by
 adapting and continuously evolving to create value ù, adding
 that governments need to stay relevant by being responsive to
 rapidly changing conditions and citizens expectations, and build
 capacity to operate effectively in complex, interdependent
 networks of organizations and systems across the public, private
 and non profit sectors to co produce public value ù It then goes on to recommend what is needed today is Flatter,
 Agile, Streamlined and Tech enabled (FAST) government ù Translating this think tankese mumbo jumbo into English, we get: Flatter = less authority; less sovereignty; Agile = more malleable; controllable; Streamlined = less meaningful; less powerful Tech enabled = subservient to those who own/operate/control
 technological R&D Need we remind ourselves that the true mission of sovereign
 nation states is not to adapt and continuously evolve ùwhich, again, is think tankese for aligning to the coming
 world government, or else ù? The true and inalienable functions of sovereign nation states and
 their governments are to: Promote the Common Good of the vast majority of the people over
 and above the interests and greed of powerful local and/or
 foreign minorities, that are embedded in local, public and
 private power structures, and Defend the country s national interest in today s dangerous, even
 deadly, world made so precisely because of small and
 illegitimately powerful minorities that have everywhere usurped
 far too much power President Putin of Russia understands this only too well; so does
 president Xi Jinping of China † Most other countries,
 however, either never learned this fundamental lesson or seem to
 have forgotten it The global elites suggest a number of measures to align civil
 service systems to the requirements of their proposed FAST
 Governments based on such factors as carefully planned workforce
 reductions coupled with the significant organizational,
 technological and workforce advances inherent in FAST governments
 to build slim and streamlined organizations that can thrive in
 the new world order Adaptive governments that share labor,
 services and resources through networked approaches and Gov 2 0
 strategies can remain slim while delivering on their mission in
 effective and innovative ways ù Yes, I know: this sounds far more like a Corporate Annual Report
 than a geopolitical piece for creative statesmanship The authors challenge governments to design and implement two
 new complementary ways of assessing governments performance The
 first set of measures consists of a holistic approach to
 government performance along the four axes defined earlier as
 FAST † The second set of measures focuses on measuring
 the value of such transformation to citizens ù If where it says government ù, you read corporations ù, and where it says citizens ù, you
 read clients ù, then you get a blueprint for private
 government Prying farther into what the future holds in store for us, Mr 
 Schwab s team partnered with the editors of Britain s leading
 science journal, Nature, and came up with a series of X
 Factors ù, five of which are truly revolutionary
 game changers Just take a look at them, and then let s infer what might lie
 behind the curtain: 1) Runaway climate change: Is it possible that we have
 already passed a point of no return and that Earth s atmosphere
 is tipping rapidly into an inhospitable state? ùThis
 ties in nicely with the Elite s proposal of imposing a Global
 Carbon Tax backed by the coming world government s legal
 framework, which will serve as a tool to control every country,
 region, city, and individual by allocating carbon credits ù based
 on their carbon footprint ù, thereby globally controlling
 all permissible activity 2) Significant cognitive enhancement: Ethical dilemmas akin
 to doping in sports could start to extend into daily working
 life; an arms race in the neural enhancement of combat troops
 could also ensue ùSuch scientific and technological
 breakthroughs are all basically controlled through the global
 network of mega corporate high tech laboratories † We have
 an example in Monsanto s patenting of genetically modified seeds;
 the leitmotiv is to impose uncrackable, unhackable, high tech and
 secret encoding over just about every resource on planet Earth:
 from seeds to sports competitions; from NSA eavesdropping to
 military gear The coming world government will reserve for its
 exclusive use specific override code factors that will allow them
 to take over communications systems, power grids and aircraft 
 military and civilian, in flight and on the ground (9/11
 Conspiracy Theorists take note!) 3) Rogue deployment of geo engineering: Technology is now
 being developed to manipulate the climate; a state or private
 individual could use it unilaterally ùAs if we
 did not know about Project HAARP High Frequency Active Auroral
 Research Program based in Alaska and Norway which has been
 undoubtedly playing dirty tricks all over the world, creating
 droughts and flooding!! It appears that HAARP installations can generate directed high
 power electromagnetic standing waves over specific geographical
 areas that interfere with weather fronts, stopping rain clouds in
 their tracks This can lead to too much rain on one side
 (floods) and too little rain on the other (droughts) of these
 invisible standing waves Also, as geologists well know, certain high power precisely aimed
 radio frequencies can be made to resonate with tectonic plates
 that are ready to slip ù; so with the right data the HAARP
 weapon might be used to trigger earthquakes/seaquakes that are
 ready to happen ù 4) Costs of living longer: Medical advances are prolonging
 life, but long term palliative care is expensive Covering the
 costs associated with old age could be a struggle ùA
 warning: The mysterious and anonymous Georgia Guidestones erected
 in 1980 in Ebert, Georgia which read like the global
 commandments, starts off by recommending the elites maintain
 humanity under 500 000 000, in perpetual balance with
 nature ù † Global depopulation is a coming ¶ 5) Discovery of alien life: Proof of life s existence
 elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological
 implications for human belief systems ùWhat a
 convincing way to bring on world government almost
 overnight! † In a Speech at the UN in 1987, former US
 President Ronald Reagan asked how quickly our differences
 worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from
 outside this world And yet, I ask is not an alien force ALREADY
 among us? ùHmmm ¶ Contact with alien life forms would demand a unified
 representation for all of mankind; yes indeed: a world
 government † And, of course, over the past 70 years,
 Hollywood has mentally programmed the world to accept that any
 such contact would be with the Elite s key representative, the
 United States If one day soon little green men from Mars were to
 tell any human, take me to your leader ù, the proper
 landing strip will, of course, be the White House lawn The think tankese conclusion: The Global Risks Report is the
 flagship research publication of the World Economic Forum s Risk
 Response Network providing an independent platform for
 stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate on building
 resilience to global risks ù Translation: Whoever controls the global agenda, the politically
 correct limits of debate and technological change, has an awfully
 huge edge over the rest of mankind, whether they are grouped by
 regions, nations, ideologies, demographics, raw material wealth,
 or whatever Actually, all this rings much more like an attempt at generating
 self fulfilling prophecies, rather than on trying to understand
 how to tackle the world s future problems Goethe was right: coming events do cast their shadows
 forward † The global elites mad drive to impose world
 government on all of us is exactly that: an increasingly dark

Commission s European Chairman Mario Monti is out; and Trilateral
Commission Member Enrico Letta is in Long live the Trilateral
Commission!It seems that there is just nothing any country in the West can do
to free itself from the shackles of the Global Power Masters and
their Megabankers No matter what elections are held; no matter what mass
demonstrations bring citizens on to the streets; no matter how many
signs are shown on millions of TV screens accusing the Megabankers
of being the worst crooks, the truth is there for all to see: the
Global Power Masters have taken over governments in country after
country, enslaving all nations to their Megabankers The mainstream media broadcast it; the alternative media point out
the sheer inhumanity of it all, even in the europeanunion where
double digit unemployment is rampant, banks are fraudulently
 bailed in by stealing account holders money, and millions of
workers houses are foreclosed on There just does not seem to be anything anybody anywhere can do
about it It all basically boils down to the vast majority of working people
in just about every country suffering the most perverse, unfair and
blatant discrimination of all: when small but extremely powerful,
unelected and illegitimate minorities discriminate against the vast
majority of disorganized and as yet unawakened citizens This is not a conspiracy theory or any such rubbish This is
something that s right before our eyes All you need to do is look
in the right places, see who are running this greatest show on
Earth , and then think with your own commonsense mind instead of
letting CNN or Rupert Murdoch do the thinking for you After three time premier Silvio Berlusconi sank Italy to new depths
of decadence where its workers have been sucked into an economic
Eurocratic maelstrom that finally led to his resignation in
November 2011, the Megabankers decided at the time to take over
Italy outright That was when they replaced Berlusconi with Mario Monti of
Trilateral Commission glory as Italy s prime minister, aswe then explained on RT Now, after Italy s recent elections we saw its aging President
Giorgio Napolitano again put a Rockefeller/Rothschild Boy in power;
because Enrico Letta too is a Trilateral Commission member And to
make sure that Megabanker theft is duly supplemented by traditional
Italian political mafias, Letta s coalition government includes
members of Berlusconi s party After all, his uncle Gianni Letta
was/is Berlusconi s right hand man So, yes indeed: Poor
Italy! The Trilateral Commission brings together Rockefeller, Morgan,
Warburg, Rothschild, Lazard, Goldman Sachs and Soros banking
interests under the aegis of global power elite geopolitical
planners like Sir Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Dominique
Mo√Øsi, Richard Perle, Philip Zelikow and Paul Wolfowitz, amongst
many others Notably, both PMs, the outgoing Mario Monti and incoming Enrico
Letta, serve the Trilateral Agenda shoulder to shoulder with the
top brass from such global megabanks as CitiCorp, HSBC, Barclays,
Nomura, Banco Santander, BBVA Bank, UBS, NM Rothschild, Deutsche
Bank, BNP, Commerzbank, † Goldman Sachs, Lazard, Mediobanca,
Morgan Stanley, Warburg Pincus, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of New
York Mellon, and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Overworld banking
agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal
Reserve Bank, Bank of England, European Central Bank, Dutch Central
Bank, Bank of † Greece, and Bank of Japan † Just a
sampling to show that this is a most powerful high class money club
if ever there was one At 70, Monti is an elderly man; at 46, Letta is a promising young
politician In Italian politics it seems that the more things
change, the more they stay the same The key question that should once again be on every Italian s mind
is: will Enrico Letta work to improve the plight of the Italian
people or to promote bankers interests? Former Argentine President
Juan Per√≥n once said that all nations presidents and premiers have
a foremost decision to make: they either govern to promote and
protect the interests of their people over and above those of the
global megabankers, or they merely work for the global megabankers
and against their own people It s a political coin that has had to be tossed by leaders time and
again since the times of Jesus † Those making the right
decision for their people often end up ousted, assassinated and
demonized Looking at the list and track records of Trilateralists who have
been catapulted into the highest echelons of power in government 
Papademos in Greece, Monti in Italy, Cavallo in Argentina, Bill
Clinton and George HW Bush in the US, Horst Kohler in Germany,
Toomas Ilves in Estonia, Condoleezza and Susan Rice (yes, both of
them!) in the US one can see a pattern So, yes: friends, Romans and countrymen everywhere, the Trilateral
Commission certainly does nave enormous clout and leverage to
promote its globalist agenda over and above every country s
national interest Letta s ascent to become Italy s new prime minister a country
with huge economic, financial, social and political problems once
again raises the question: Who decides?Is it the Italian people who have freely and democratically chosen
to have an elite megabanker friendly bureaucrat run their country
or as in Greece, France, the UK and so many other countries is
there a hidden hand that discretely catapults its own servants into
the highest places of power?Do We, the People ever really decide anything or are we just
asked to legitimize through some high profile election, decisions
they have already taken? Do our real political choices thus boil
down to two, maybe three, elite candidates? A sort of
 you can have Coke or Pepsi non choice?If this only happened in Italy, we could say that it s some sort of
 Italian problem † But, no: there s clearly a pattern whereby
global power brokers first recruit and then very discretely promote
their chosen players to the top echelons of entities like the
Trilateral Commission where they are suitably groomed, positioned,
prepared, coached and politically and financially armed 
Normally, such individuals have little or no allegiance to their
countries of origin and countrymen, but rather are align to the
supranational globalist agenda And they plan well in advance too! † An April 27 FoxNews TV
report just aired a pro Bush Family program showing that The Powers
That Be are already busy toying with the idea that Jeb Bush 
another Baby Bush might just be the right guy to run for
president of the United States on the Republican Party ticket in
2016 s presidential elections Not surprisingly, many powerful Democrats are, in turn, already
working to put Hillary Clinton as their candidate for those
presidentials That would mean that in 2016 the American people just might have to
choose between Jeb Bush (son of Trilateral member George HW Bush)
and Hillary Clinton (wife of Trilateralist Bill Clinton) † I
know, I know: just a coincidence Come to think of it, maybe the title of this article should not
just be Poor Italy , but rather Poor Italy and Greece
and Argentina and Germany and USA and Estonia and Benjamin Disraeli British Queen Victoria s prime minister in the
19th century once said that ÄúThe world is governed by very
different personages from what is imagined by those who are not
behind the scenes ÄùA lucid vision from someone who was in a position to know †
Add to this 21st century trillions of money sloshing politics and,
once again, we see that on the global political stage, money does
indeed make the world go around The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/italy-government-letta-monti-610/
"19 Apr, 2013",Gold bounces back ‚Äì but for good?,"Gold is on the rebound after a 4 5% drop this week, and the plunge has triggered serious concern about the condition of the global economy The Comex index has passed the $1,400 mark, gaining 21 5 points
to $1,412 60 an ounce at 15:17 DST We are already seeing a strong response to the fall in
prices, with a sharp pick up in physical gold sales by investors
and retail consumers in the two key consumer markets India and
China, ùMark Pervan, head of commodity strategy at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group, wrote toBloombergtoday While the value of the biggest gold producers declined by $169
billion, jewelers took advantage of the 30 year record low gold
prices to stock up for anticipated high demand retail and jewelry
sales Chinese and Indian jewelers are optimistic that gold will
rebound as much as 29% by December 2013, to as high as $1,800 an
ounce, as demand increases, according to billionaire Indian jeweler
T S Kalyanaraman,Reutersreported There s been continued buying interest, particularly into
China, ùNigel Moffatt, treasurer of Australia s Perth Mint said
on Bloomberg Television Friday Americans took advantage of the price dip to buy stock in a
historically high yielding investment In April, the US Mint sold 153,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins, a three year high, according to its website The recent slump in gold has been paired with disturbing
economic data forecasting significant slowing in some of the
world s largest economies † the US,China, andRussia The gold drops are signaling concerns about global growth, 
said Mohamed El Erian, the co chief investment officer of PIMCO,
which oversees $2 trillion in assets,Reutersreported Commodities have been sending the signal on growth for a
while, and now even louder, El Erian added Gold has certainly been the loudest of the flailing indexes,
after it plunged 14% in the first two April sessions, hitting a
30 year low as slowed growth data from the US and China trickled
in Prices also dropped as the Cypriot bailout payment plan toyed
with the idea of selling 75% of their reserves to help finance the
bailout, which spooked investors other cash strapped European
states, like Spain and Portugal, might do the same The economic slowdown was confirmed by the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday when it trimmed back its forecast on
economic growth in 2013, down to 3 3% from the earlier 3 5%
projection Citigroup predicted, and was correct, that 2013 would be the
first year when commodity prices at the end of the year were lower
than at the beginning Citigroup predicted the end of the super cycle when rising
prices commodities supersede demand As growth slows, governments are scrambling to find a way to
stay afloat Most governments are doing this via cash stimulus 
simply printing more money to avoid deflation, the Bank of Japan
the premier example The recent retreats in gold, oil, and other precious metals and
energy stocks, are evidence to many of a weak and maybe slightly
unstable economy Because metals and energy are so closely tied
to industrial growth, a decline in their demand can provide an
accurate reading of an global economic performance As inflation falls, this in turn reduces the value of gold as a
fortification against rising prices If investors forecast an
inflation dip, gold will also lose its value Because the global economy is on the downside of a global
credit bubble, it seems unreasonable to expect abnormal
inflation, said Richard Bernstein, the head of an investment
advisory firm in New York,Reutersreported Gold, a major investment for both individuals and institutions,
provides a viable alternative to currency that their government can
just print more of It also provides and investment alternative to
stocks George Soros cut his holdings in SPDR Gold Trust by 55% last

$1,487, as investors continue their selling frenzy The sell off has all the hallmarks of panic driven, stale long
liquidation, stop loss and capitulation selling in the face of a
concerted short sale ù Peter Richardson, a Morgan Stanley analyst,
wrote in a report According to JPMorgan s report, it s not a time to invest, or
reinvest in gold Merrill Lynch recently warned that gold could fall to $1,200

For owning an offshore account?The ICIJ groupclaims, The hoard of documents represents
the biggest stockpile of inside information about the offshore
system ever obtained by a media organization more than 160 times
larger than the leak of U S State Department documents by

global media is, the names of the newspapers the ICIJ chose to

Post, among others UK Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to
use his leadership of the G8 to help crack down on tax evasion and
money laundering While the mainstream world press is focusing on the leaks, it s
relevant to ask just who is this ICIJ leaker?According to their website, the ICIJ was founded in 1997 as a
project of the Center for Public Integrity to extend the
Center s style of watchdog journalism ù Among financial donors
to ICIJ are opensociety Foundations, which have been involved in
many countries targeted by the US State Department for regime
change or colorrevolution s ù including Georgia, Ukraine, Burma
(Myanmar), Libya The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of
Hewlett Packard founder and former Assistant Defense Secretary
David Packard, among others But the more interesting organization is the one which created
ICIJ: the Center for Public Integrity, which shares the same office
floor with ICIJ Here we find a creation of the most powerful
families of Wall Street and US political establishment The Center
for Public Integrity was created in 1989 to enhance
democracyby revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal
of trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the
tools of investigative journalism ù † Sounds noble
enough Notably, however, listed funders in 2012 of the Center include the
Ford Foundation, documented in the Cold War to work intimately with
the CIA; George Soros opensociety Foundations; John D &
Catherine T MacArthur Foundation; billionaire Wall Street banker
Sandy Bernstein s Sanford C Bernstein & Co , LLC; GE
Foundation; Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller Family
Fund Now what do America s cr√®me de la cr√®me of powerful families and
bankers find so compelling about financing an organization of
journalists who now hold documents allegedly containing material
that could be used to blackmail governments and politicians and
businessmen around the globe? Are their offshore holdings to be
exposed along with those of Russians or French or Germans?The relevant question is what agency would have the capacity to
hack international computer data banks and secret encrypted banking
offshore records to give to ICIJ? The methodology of the ICIJ suggests another agenda at play A
global witch hunt against private fortunes îlegal or illegal îhas
begun No longer is it a former employee of UBS or another Swiss
bank who steals data files of a few secret German clients to give
German tax authorities as an act of conscience ù Now all offshore
accounts in the world can presumably be exposed as ICIJ
decides James S Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey & Company,estimatesthat wealthy individuals have $21
trillion to $32 trillion in private financial wealth tucked away in
offshore havens The question is what agency or agencies of which governments have
the espionage facilities to pull off such a massive global hacking
of all offshore bank accounts?William A Hamilton was involved in the Reagan years with a project
that the National Security Agency initiated to interdict the sale
of embargoed technology to the Soviet Union In a recent exchange
with the author regarding the source ù for the ICIJ files on global
offshore accounts, Hamilton noted, NSA is one and perhaps the only
obvious candidate ù He added that in the 1980s the NSA obtained
a copy of [Hamilton s software] PROMIS from the US Department of
Justice and arranged for copies to be installed on computers in the
banking sector (wire transfer clearing houses the World Bank major
commercial and investment banks worldwide) to facilitate NSA s
real time electronic surveillance ù † Clearly in the
intervening three decades the NSA international banking covert
espionage capabilities must have been upgraded There is a role for genuine honest investigative journalism, but
the Secrecy for Sale project of the ICIJ smells like a massive US

"16 Apr, 2013",Gold goes bear-shaped: Billions lost as precious metal plummets,"Billionaire John Paulson lost almost $1 billion as gold posted its steepest decline in 30 years hitting $1,361 per ounce The precious metal is no longer seen as a safe haven asset Those who decided that it was
too early to dump gold for good, lost a lot in the past few days 
Billionaire John Paulson lost almost $1 billion of his personal
wealth in the past two days as gold price fell to its lowest in
almost two years, losing 13 per cent, Bloomberg reports Out of
around $9 5 billion invested across his hedge funds, some 85 per
cent is invested in gold Influential investor George Soros seemed well prepared for the
slump He said earlier in April that gold has been destroyed as
a safe haven ùduring the euro crisis However he added he
expected the global central banks to continue buying gold to
support prices Speaking with the South China Morning Post, Soros sounded
cautious on the metal It has disappointed the public, because it is meant to be
the ultimate safe haven But when the euro was close to collapsing
last year, actually gold went down, because if people needed to
sell something, they could sell gold, ùSoros said Soros said he did not expect gold to go down ù However
he started significantly shortening his positions in gold in 2011
when he dubbed gold the ultimate bubble Back then he sold
most of his holdings in the bullion backed SPDR Gold Trust and
iShares Gold Trust funds and invested in mining instead Some experts believe its is too early to drop gold If the
economy in the US does not recover, gold might yet be a worthy
hedge Renowned bond investor Bill Gross, the manager of PIMCO s Total
Return Fund said in early February said that he saw gold as a
 stellar inflationary hedge ù as global central banks attempt to
reflate their economies Investor Jim Rogers commenting on the latest gold drop to
Bloomberg, said he s not buying the commodity yet, as he expects it
to go even lower This may be the correction that gold needs, ùsaid
Rogers, chairman of Rogers Holdings If it goes down enough, I
will start buying it, ùRogers told reporters in
Singapore Precious metals are a very special type of asset 
Manufacturing demand is smaller than investment demand so you can
hardly call it a traditional raw material Moreover unlike stocks
and bonds gold does not generate profit on its own The only reason
to keep gold is the risk of inflation, as well as lack of
confidence in traditional types of assets, ùMoscow based asset
manager Timofey Martynov explained to RT In the past two years I ve not been recommending to invest in
gold because the potential profit is the same as its risk, while
there has been and still are no signs of inflation And even if
tomorrow gold falls to $1000, I wouldn t say that you have to buy
it because it s cheap It would be reasonable to return to gold
only in several cases steady signs of a price surge, a major
conflict (Iran, North Korea etc) or, for example, the collapse of
the eurozone, ùhe said Experts say gold dropped so significantly due to a number of
short and long term reasons JPMorgan sees falling global inflation
as the main factor slashing gold s value as a sustainable hedge In the short term, the main reason for gold s weakness is the
rise of the US dollar value due to the credit crisis in Europe 
Signals that the US economy is recovering may force the Federal
Reserve to withdraw its stimulus package sooner than expected, the
Economic Times reports Goldman Sachs lowered its gold price prognosis expecting
accelerating US economic growth The price forecast for 2013 was
lowered to $1,545 an ounce from $1,610 The forecast for 2014 hints
at a further decline to $1,350 an ounce from $1,490 Global investors were seen getting rid of gold and transferring
their funds in riskier assets Weak economic data from China and
reports that Cyprus could sell of its gold reserves to pay off
debts contributed to the latest slump in the gold price Meanwhile analysts at Citigroup claim the commodities super
cycle might be over Citi Research s Ed Morse, released a report on
Friday, to coincide with the historic gold slump, while oil prices
demonstrated a steep decline as well The second quarter should provide another affirmation that
the so called commodity super cycle has finally ended and should
usher in the first normal year in over a decade in which,
broadly, commodity prices end the year lower than when the year
started, ùMorse s reports said adding that the super cycle
headed towards the end for several years dubbing it Supercyle
Funeral ù that began in 2011 This year would be the after party, ù
he added Experts also foresee a drop in prices for aluminum, copper and
nickel by some 5% 10% in 2013, and by 8% to 13% in the following

"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their

receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the opensociety 
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
"6 Apr, 2013",Boao Forum: Chinese convention rivals Davos,"When people hear economic forum the first thing they probably think about is Davos and snowy Alps But that is set to change as China s Boao hosts the largest and most representative economic summit in Asia The rapid rise of the so called Asian tigers has shifted the
focus eastwards, when it comes to world economic development 
Initiated by China in 2001, the Boao Forum focuses not only on
Asian economic issues, but also address global political and
economic problems The 12th Boao Forum in 2013 has already proven to be a truly
global, not just Asian event, once again bringing the world s
attention to the emerging nations ever growing economic clout Heads of state, business leaders and Nobel Prize winners,
altogether 1,477 representatives from 43 countries and regions have
all gathered in China to discuss pressing global issues This is the largest [economic] forum in Asia, ùKsenia
Yudaeva, Russia s representative for G20 summit preparations, told
RT Here you can see that Asia is the new center of world s
economic growth ù This year the forum is attracting some big names, like
Microsoft s Bill Gates, investor George Soros and head of the IMF
Christine Lagarde The vision of that forum is really comparable to Davos in
representation of speakers of Europe, the US and Asian countries I
would call it an Asian Davos, ùsaid Yudaeva, who also occupies
position of chief of the Presidential Experts Directorate in
Russia While Europe and the US are battling economic recession, China s
trade volume is growing steadily For many countries China has
already become the number one trade partner, a place previously
occupied by the US So there is little wonder that world leaders
and business gurus from countries affected by the crisis are
flocking to China s tropical Hainan Island for some advice and,
hopefully, remedy Unlike a BRICS summit, which is largely a government to
government thing, ùthe Boao Forum serves different purposes,
because it deepens contact between the civilsociety , business
and academics ùprofessor of political studies at the University
of Manitoba, Rhadika Desai, told RT One really important thing about this is that they are going
to move away from hub and spoke relationship that the developing
countries once had with the Western world and the advanced
industrial countries and began to create more contacts,
investment and trade amongst themselves, ùsaid Desai, who has
written extensively on the rise of emerging economies The global economic crisis made the Eastern countries realize
that the best way to deal with crisis is to widen your domestic
market to engage it a lot more and make it the driver of growth 
This is very important for laying the foundation for sustainable
long term autonomous [economic] growth, ùshe stressed The old export led [economic] growth model, which was being
followed and prescribed in the pre crisis era, is basically
defunct It could work as long as the US was able and willing to
observe the goods of the Western world, but as we know, it observed
it at the cost of giving excessive crediting to the rest of the
world, ùDesai concluded The BRICS countries have recently signed an agreement to trade
in their own national currencies, not the US dollar That move is
expected to eventually ditch the American currency Rumors about
China s yuan becoming one of the world s reserve currencies have
been discussed for quite some time already Washington has for years been accusing Beijing of manipulating
the exchange rate of Chinese national currency to gain some trade
advantages But China rejects all allegations, demonstrating
resilience in diplomacy and independence in economic
decision making   ",https://www.rt.com/news/boao-forum-asia-davos-429/

Cyprus which like its recent Greek, Irish, Spanish, Portuguese
and Italian versions continues to fester like a malignant tumor
in the body politic and economy of the europeanunion When times are stable and predictable, economics is treated like
a science by bankers, academics, journalists and politicians
aligned to the money power elite All economic and social woes are explained away as resulting
from the laws of the economy ùand the invisible hand of
the market ù † Economists theorizing mumbo jumbo never
tells you is that the invisible hand ù is moved by a muscular arm ùthat is directed by a perverse brain They try to convince us that it s normal ùfor markets,
sectors and entire countries to go up, down, sideways, even dive
into mega collapses Such economic nonsense is normally signed by Harvard, LSE or
Chicago University eggheads, suitably prestiged with Economics
Nobel Prizes, and lavishly promoted by the mainstream specialized
media like the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times However, as soon as the economic weather turns foul and the
waves of currency instability, winds of banking crises and tornados
of panic start rocking the boats of national and regional
economies, that s when the science of economics ùtakes a
really bad turn and it s every many for himself! † Or every
banker gets government ùto bail them out In economics what counts is Confidence and Trust, either real or
perceived That s why banks head offices tend to look like
veritable fortresses or gigantic skyscrapers, often with imposing
temple like columns, giant staircases and forbidding iron clad
gates † The idea was clear: when you enter a bank, you enter
the Temple of Mammon † Financial Olympuses like the FED, Bank
of England, and most every central bank beckon you to trust ùthem, just as you trust your God when you enter
Church; to have confidence ù in them for, like the Almighty,
bankers want to make you believe that they too reign for ever and
ever But, alas, as Patrick Young writing on RT Op Edge on Cyprusclearly explains, confidence remains a
rather intangible item Measuring trust is rather a black art We
can never be absolutely certain we have 100%
trust ù Indeed! † Trust is like virginity: once it s gone, IT S
GONE † So when trust turns sour regarding a particular bank,
or rumors arise of impending monetary collapse, or some major
corporation is about to be AIG ed ùout of existence, then trust and confidence ùturn into bank runs, panic and deadly
collapse What Cyprus 2013 shows is that, like Argentina 2001, trust
and confidence ùhave little or nothing to do with reality
especially when passed through the mainstream media s Lies
Machine for, like all perceptions, they can be manipulated to
fool, confound, hide ugly truths and distort When things start going really bad, fraudulent lies are
maintained for as long as possible to give those who DO know the
truth, the chance to exit quietly and unscathed † Once they
are at a safe distance then yes: all hell can be let loose! That happened during Argentina s massive banking, financial and
monetary collapse of 2001/2: social chaos, dozens killed in clashes
with police, 50% of the population buried below the poverty line,
40% drop in GDP, and yet not one single private bank folded! Argentina s then president Fernando De la R√∫a and his
Rockefeller Soros wizard Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo did
everything the mega bankers needed to weather the storm, but
nothing to help we the people ùwho lost life savings, jobs,
homes, health benefits Not surprisingly, after more than a decade Argentina s
government ensures a business as usual ùbanking atmosphere:
politicians and megabankers always cozy up to each other
(money sloshing tends to do that ) What about we the people ù ? † Argentine workers
continue biting the dust suffering all sorts of
government triggered abuse inflation, a total foreign exchange
lock down, and ferocious tax collector persecution †
Why? † When President Kirchner of Argentina must choose between
local workers and global megabankers, she systematically chooses
the latter with suitable media marketing of course Does this ring a bell? † Spain? † Italy? †
Greece? † Ireland? † Cyprus? Occupy Wall Streeters ? A tip: don t believe the mainstream media; don t believe
government liars; above all: don t believe the megabankers! Example: If you re having a drink at the pub and your mate
knocks your pint of beer on your lap: Ooops! † Sorry!!
Acccident † If he does that again 5 minutes later: Gosh what
bad luck!!! † If he does that a third time: HE S DOING IT ON
PURPOSE! † For some reason, it s the guy s behaviour pattern so
best to keep away from him! Now look at recurrent sovereign debt banking crises: Argentina
suffered four debt crises ùover the past forty years that
were all so similar to what later happened in 2008 in the US; which
was identical to the banking crises in the UK and Iceland, which
were then repeated in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy; which
flared last year in Greece and today robs Cypriot workers down to
their bones † Accident? † Bad luck? No It s a
System! We are in fact dealing with major fraud perpetrated by the
global megabanking establishment and done legally ùbecause
they pay for, finance, position and control key government posts in
the executive, legislative and judicial branches of governments in
just about every country Whether Argentina or Brazil, the US or Britain, Spain or Italy,
Greece or Cyprus † Same story; even the same players Because the global megabanking establishment have worked really
hard through their media, universities and their own players to
blind us to a key factor no one ever talks about: the difference
between public money (issued by the State) and private money
(created by private banks almost out of nothing) Publicmoney are the dollar, euro, peso and pound bills
circulating in different parts of the world issued by public
banking authorities, normally a national central bank having
monopoly issuance rights † Any private citizen doing the same
will, if caught, end up in jail † And rightly so because
counterfeiting currency adds money to the system but no work is
added to the Real Economy † The message to the people is
clear: You want money? † Work for it! Privatemoney, however, is created by the private banking
system thanks to Fractional Lending which legally allows them to
create loans for 10, 20 or 50 times the amount of deposits in their
vaults and then charge interest for them! † But private bank
money is just a figure on your bank statement or a blip on your ATM
screen † Like all screens it can go blank in a moment, in
a twinkling of an eye ùThe message to the bankers is
clear: You want money? Create it for nothing! People instinctively understand this which is why millions of
Argentinians cued at their ATM s waiting to get some""real
money ù(even if Mr Cavallo s corralito ù limited that to 250
pesos per week) † Fast forward eleven years to Cyprus: same
picture of people trying to withdraw 100 euros before they re all
gone 1) The private megabanker cabal uses their leverage/control over
governments and politicians so legislation is passed ensuring that
the central bank never provides the right amount of public money
the real economy of goods, services and investment needs; i e , no
credit 2) In come the private bankers, asking government: You need
money build highways, finance defense, education and health? †
No problem: we ll lend you all you want! ù 3) Government keeps borrowing and borrowing way beyond its
means 4) Bankers and politicians refinance debt again and again and
again, until it balloons way beyond repayment possibilities of the
victim nation Oh, the wonders of compound interest!! Say you re president of a country and you need to build a 100
mile road costing $ 120 000 000 over a one year period, at an
investment rate of $ 10 000 000 per month to pay for steel, cement,
constructors, architects, workers, etc † Everything is set to
go; you have two options: Option 1:Ask private bankers to loan you $ 120 000 000
at, say, 10% interest which means you are indebted by $
132 000 000 The bankers funding you will, no doubt, impose certain
conditions like you re having to use such and such a construction
company, insurer, consultant, cement, steel
providers Final cost: probably closer to $ 140 to 150 million †
Irresponsible modern politicians will of course just dump that debt
into the federal deficit black hole † Let the next president
or prime minister tackle it! Meanwhile, compound interest makes the debt grow and grow and
grow: music to mega bankers ears! Even more stupid: for a country like Argentina the loan will be
in Dollars even though everything they need to build the highway 
cement, steel, architects, workers is available locally and could
be paid in local pesos Final Result: Public indebtedness in foreign currency in an
amount 40 or 50% more than actually needed, that will continue to
grow under compound interest Option 2:You order your central bank to issue $
10 000 000 per month for 12 months in local currency † This
may have a temporary inflationary effect that is immediately offset
because government recovers tranches of that money through taxes
that cement, steel and service providers start paying to your tax
office, plus labor dues paid by workers † You repeat this for
the 2nd, 3rd, 4th months until the 12th month when the highway is
finished † Final equation: a good part of the currency issued
immediately flowed back to your tax office (who can take it out of
circulation), and the rest that remained † in circulation can
be recovered longer term through road tolls † In fact most of
it will be absorbed by increased demand emanating from real
economic growth generated by the new highway (gas stations, diners,
new towns, etc ) Benefits:you did it with your local currency at ZERO
INTEREST † If you do your homework right, the temporary
transitional inflationary effect can be duly neutralized †
Final Public Debt: Zero Now, you be the judge: what s better, financing with public
currency issued under a sovereign model, or with private banking
money that makes sovereign debt grow way beyond your means, leading
to inevitable Sovereign Debt crises in country after country; not
by mistake but by design That is what megabankers want in terms of money, and that is
what the Global Power Elite seeks because public debt ensures full
control of countries † To add insult to injury, when bankers
really screw things up as in 2008, government and media tell that
we must save those nice banks because they re too big to
fail ù † You put your money in a Cyprus bank? Sorry you ll
have to chip in with 20, 50 or 100 percent of it to save the
bankers Now do we understand what s behind this whole diabolical,
perverse, fraudulent and immoral Sovereign Debt Crisis system? Adrian Salbuchi for RT Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

"20 Feb, 2013",Not so precious anymore: Gold losing its shine as global economy spreads its wings,"The price of gold is tumbling and has reached $1609 an ounce which is 10% less than its October high of $1798 10 According to some analysts, the main reason for the fall is
growing economic stability in the world An improving global
economy reduces the appeal of gold as the safe harbor it is usually
considered as by buyers during harsh times While the perspective
doesn t look exactly cheerful right now, with Europe s recession
deepening in 4Q 2012 as its economy shrank 0 6%, it still seems as
if things are starting to look up Particularly, the US economy is
raising its head as the Federal Reserve may end its third round of
stimulus measures We re probably very close to seeing panic lows in the price
of gold, ù says Ronald Stoeferle, an analyst at Incrementum
Advisors AG , a Swiss based financial services firm, in an
interview with The Globe and Mail Generally Central Banks buy gold as a defense against
hyperinflation However, at the beginning of 2013 there was no
sharp increase in inflation, which did not meet investors 
expectations As a result, investors and Central Banks started
cutting their positions in gold, which led to the price falling 
However, if inflation in Europe, the United States and China grows,
gold prices might start climbing again in 2Q 2013, ù Andrey
Shenk, an economic analyst from Moscow based Investcafe, told
RT Another fact that triggered the fall of the precious metal s
price was the liquidation of a large part of the gold held by major
speculators, including billionaire George Soros who cut his holding
in one of the major gold investment funds by nearly $100 million in
the fourth quarter of 2012 Gold demand has also been weak in two major markets of the
world, China and India In China all business was put on hold
during the Chinese New Year holidays last week In India where gold
has traditional cultural uses less is being sold due to high import
taxes introduced by the government in an effort to improve the
country s trade balance As of now,the world s biggest buyer of goldis Russia as its
Central Bank acquired 570 metric tons during the last decade, an
amount almost triple the weight of the American Statue of
Liberty Russia s numbers are no surprise, as the country is a big
gold producer As an export oriented country it needs large gold
and foreign currency reserves to balance the books, and it is more
efficient to buy gold on the domestic market Thus, during the last
decade Russia has been buying around 60 70% of the gold it produces
for its gold reserves, ù Shenk explained to RT The metal was perceived as an economic buffer and also proven a
sound investment and opportunity for the Russian state to make
money, with gold prices crawling upwards over the past 12 years,
gaining 12% in 2012 alone, though the tables could be turning right

"26 Dec, 2012",US attempting regime change in Malaysia: Fact or fiction? (Op-Ed),"As the South East Asian nation of Malaysia prepares for general elections, distrust of the political opposition and accusations of foreign interference have been major talking points in the political frequencies emanating from Kuala Lumpur The United Malays National Organization (UMNO) leads the country s ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and has maintained power since Malaysian independence in 1957 One of Malaysia s most recognizable figures is former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been credited with ushering in large scale economic growth and overseeing the nation s transition from an exporter of palm oil, tin, and other raw materials, into an industrialized economy that manufactures automobiles and electronic goods The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who once held the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mahathir s administration, but was sacked over major disagreements on how to steer Malaysia s economy during the 1997 Asian financial crisis Today, the political climate in Malaysia is highly polarized and a sense of unpredictability looms over the nation Malaysia s current leader, Prime Minister Najib Razak, has pursued a reform minded agenda by repealing authoritarian legislation of the past and dramatically loosening controls on expression and political pluralism introduced under Mahathir s tenure Najib has rolled back Malaysia s Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detention without trial, and has liberalized rules regarding the publication of books and newspapers During Malaysia s 2008 general elections, the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition experienced its worst result in decades, with the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition winning 82 parliamentary seats For the first time, the ruling party was deprived of its two thirds parliamentary majority, which is required to pass amendments to Malaysia s Federal Constitution In the run up to elections scheduled to take place before an April 2013 deadline, figures from all sides of the political spectrum are asking questions about the opposition s links to foreign funders in Washington The question of foreign funding Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad has long captured the ire of officials from Washington and Tel Aviv, and though he s retired, he has channeled his energies into the Perdana Global Peace Foundation, which recently hosted an international conference in Kuala Lumpur calling for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 and has sought to investigate war crimes committed in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan Mahathir has been an ardent critic of Israel and organizations such as AIPAC, and has recently accused US based organizations the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the opensociety Institute (OSI) of holding a concealed intention to influence Malaysia s domestic politics through the funding of local NGOs and groups directly linked to Anwar Ibrahim s Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition In an article the former prime minister published in the New Straits Times, a leading mainstream newspaper, Mahathir accuses financier George Soros and his organization, the opensociety Institute, of promoting democracy ù in Eastern Europe to pave the way for colonization by global finance capital Mahathir acknowledges how OSI pumped millions into opposition movements and independent media in Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of strengthening civilsociety , only to have like minded individuals nominated by Soros s own foundation come to power in those countries The former prime minister has also pointed to how Egypt (prior to Mohamad Morsi taking power) has cracked down on NGOs affiliated with NED, namely groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and Freedom House, which are all recipients of funding from the US State Department In Malaysia, high profile NGOs and media outlets have admittedly received funding from OSI and satellite organizations of NED Premesh Chandran, the CEO of the nation s most prominent alternative media outlet, Malaysiakini, is a grantee of George Soros s opensociety Foundations and launched the news organization with a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok based Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), another organization with dubious affiliations to the US State Department Malaysiakini has come under pressure from local journalists for the lack of transparency in its financial management and hesitance in revealing the value of its shares Additionally, Suaram, an NGO promoting human rights, has borne heavy criticism over its funding and organizational structure The Companies Commission of Malaysia launched investigations into Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd, a private company linked to Suaram, and found it to be a conduit for money being used to channel funds from NED Suaram has been instrumental in legitimizing allegations of a possible cover up of the murder of a Mongolian fashion model, Altantuya Shaaribuu, who was living in Malaysia in 2006 and associated with government officials that have been linked to a kickback scandal involving the government s purchase of submarines from France Senator Ezam Mohd Nor, himself a recipient of Suaram s Human Rights Award, has accused the organization of employing poor research methods and attempting to disparage the government: Malaysians have the right to feel suspicious about them They have been making personal allegations against the Prime Minister [Najib Razak] on the murder of Altantuya and many other cases without proof their motive is very questionable especially when they are more inclined towards ridiculing and belittling the ruling government ùThe German Embassy in KL has reportedly admitted that it has provided funds to Suaram s project in 2010 Malaysia s Foreign Minister Anifah Aman followed by making strong statements to the German Ambassador and declared that Germany s actions could be viewed as interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the opensociety Institute Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton While Sreenevasan s organization claimed to be non partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations Anatomy of Malaysia s political opposition Malaysia is a multi cultural and multi religious state, and both the ruling and opposition parties attempt to represent the nation s three largest ethnic groups Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysians are either ethnic Malay or other indigenous groups and are mostly listed as Muslim, while another 25 per cent are ethnic Chinese who are predominantly Buddhist, with 7 per cent mostly Hindu Indian Malaysians The United Malays National Organization, the Malaysian Chinese Association, and the Malaysian Indian Congress head Barisan Nasional The opposition, Pakatan Rakyat, currently controls four state governments and is led by Anwar Ibrahim s Keadilan Rakyat, the Chinese led Democratic Action Party (DAP), and staunchly Islamist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) While a large percentage of urbanites with legitimate grievances are quick to acknowledge the government s shortcomings, many are hesitant to back Anwar Ibrahim due to his connections with neo conservative thinkers in Washington and general disunity within the opposition † Ibrahim maintains close ties with senior US officials and organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy In 2005, Ibrahim chaired the Washington based Foundation for the Future, established and funded by the US Department of State at the behest of Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of then Vice President Dick Cheney, thanks in large part to his cozy relationship with Paul Wolfowitz While Ibrahim was on trial for allegedly engaging in sodomy with a male aide (of which he was acquitted sometime later), Wolfowitz and former US Vice President Al Gore authored a joint opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in support of Ibrahim, while the Washington Post published an editorial calling for consequences that would affect Malaysia s relations with Washington if Ibrahim was to be found guilty Ibrahim enraged many when he stated that he would support policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview with the Wall Street Journal; this is particularly controversial in Malaysia, where support for Palestine is largely unanimous Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar writes: It is obvious that by acknowledging the primacy of Israeli security, Anwar was sending a clear message to the deep state and to Tel Aviv and Washington that he is someone that they could trust In contrast, the Najib government, in spite of its attempts to get closer to Washington, remains critical of Israeli aggression and intransigence Najib has described the Israeli government as a òserial killer and a ògangster ù Members of Barisan Nasional have addressed Ibrahim s connections to the National Endowment for Democracy in the Malaysian Parliament, including his participation in NED s òDemocracy Award event held in Washington DC in 2007 Independent journalists have uncovered letters written by Anwar Ibrahim, two of which were sent to NED President Carl Gershman in Washington DC that discussed sending an international election observer team to Malaysia and general issues related to electoral reform A third letter was sent to George Soros, expressing interest in collaborating with an accountability firm headed by Ibrahim Pakatan Rakyat s Communications Director, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, verified the authenticity of the documents This should come as little surprise, as Ibrahim s economic policies have historically aligned with institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, in contrast to Mahathir, whose protectionist economic policies opposed international financial institutions and allowed Malaysia to navigate and largely resurface from the 1997 Asian financial crisis unscathed An issue that concerns secular and non Muslim Malaysian voters is the role of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as part of the opposition In sharp contrast to the moderate brand of Islam preached by UMNO, the organization s primary objective is the founding of an Islamic state The PAS has spoken of working within the framework of Malaysia s parliamentary democracy, but holds steadfast to implementing sharia law on a national scale, which would lead to confusing implications for Malaysia s sizable non Muslim population The debate around the implementation of Islamic hudud penal code is something that other Pakatan Rakyat coalition members, such as figures in the Chinese led Democratic Action Party, have been unable to agree on The PAS enjoys support from rural Malay Muslims in conservative states such as Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu in northern Malaysia, though they have very limited appeal to urbanites While certain individuals in PAS have raised questions about NGOs receiving foreign funding, Mahathir has insinuated that PAS s leadership has been largely complicit: They [foreign interests] want to topple the government through the demonstration and Nik Aziz [Spiritual leader of PAS] said it is permissible to bring down the government in this manner They want to make Malaysia like Egypt, Tunisia, which were brought down through riots and now Syria when the government does not fall, they [Pakatan Rakyat] can appeal to the foreign power to help and bring down, even if it means using fire power ù Feasibility of òregime change narrative It must be acknowledged that the current administration led by Prime Minister Najib Razak has made great strides toward improving relations with Washington At a meeting with President Barack Obama in 2010, Najib offered Malaysia s assistance to cooperate with the United States to engage the Muslim world; Najib also expressed willingness to deploy Malaysian aid personnel to Afghanistan, and allegedly agreed on the need to maintain a unified front on Iran s nuclear program Najib has employed a Washington based public relations firm, APCO, to improve Malaysia s image in the US and has seemingly embraced American economic leadership of the region through his support for the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement Some would argue that Najib is perhaps the most pro American leader Malaysia has ever had † ì a stark contrast to the boldness of Mahathir Despite Najib having good rapport with formal Western leaders, it is clear with whom the thank tank policy architects, Zionist lobbies, and foundation fellows have placed their loyalties Sentiment among Malaysia s youth and pro democracy ù activists, who constitute a small but vocal minority, tend be entirely dismissive of the òregime change narrative, viewing it as pre election diversionary rhetoric of the ruling party While bogeymen of the Zionist variety are often invoked in Malaysian political discourse, it would be negligent to ignore the effects of Washington sponsored òdemocracy promotion in the global context, which have in recent times cloaked mercenary elements and insurgents in the colors of freedom fighting, and successfully masked geopolitical restructuring and the ushering in of neo liberal capitalism with the hip and fashionable vigor of òpeople power coups As the United States continues to militarily increase its presence in the Pacific region in line with its strategic policy shift to East Asia, policy makers in Washington would like to see compliant heads of state who will act to further American interests in the ASEAN region Let s not ignore the elephant in the room; the real purpose of America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify the region as a counterweight against Beijing The defense ministries of Malaysia and China held a landmark defense and security consultation in September 2012, in addition to frequent bilateral state visits and enhanced economic cooperation It was the father of the current leader, Malaysia s second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, who made the landmark visit to Beijing to normalize relations in 1974, and under his son Najib, Sino Malaysian relations and cooperation have never been better Following the global economic crisis of 2008, Najib looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented economy, emphasizing increased Chinese investment into Malaysia and expanding the base of Sino Malaysian trade in areas like education and student exchange, finance, infrastructure development, science and technology, yielding lucrative and mutually beneficial results China has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures reaching US$90 billion in 2011; Malaysia is China s largest trading partner among ASEAN nations In asking the question of regime change in Malaysia, Dr Chandra Muzaffar reflects on Washington s moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the Asia Pacific region: Establishing a military base in Darwin [Australia], resurrecting the US military alliance with the Philippines, coaxing Japan to play a more overt military role in the region, instigating Vietnam to confront China over the Spratly Islands, and encouraging India to counterbalance Chinese power, are all part and parcel of the larger US agenda of encircling and containing China In pursuing this agenda, the US wants reliable allies ì not just friends ì in Asia In this regard, Malaysia is important because of its position as a littoral state with sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, which is one of China s most critical supply routes that transports much of the oil and other materials vital for its economic development Will the containment of China lead to a situation where the hegemon, determined to perpetuate its dominant power, seek to exercise control over the Straits in order to curb China s ascendancy? Would a trusted ally in Kuala Lumpur facilitate such control? The current Malaysian leadership does not fit the bill ù Backwards and forwards Pakatan Rakyat, the main opposition coalition pitted against the ruling party, has yet to offer a fully coherent organizational program, and if the coalition ever came to power, the disunity of its component parties and their inability to agree on fundamental policies would be enough to conjure angrier, disenchanted youth back on to the streets, in larger numbers perhaps What is ticklishly ironic about reading op eds penned by the likes of Wolfowitz and Al Gore, and how they laud Malaysia as a progressive and moderate model Islamic state, is that they concurrently demonize its leadership and dismiss them authoritarian thugs Surely, the ruling coalition has its shortcomings; the politicization of race and religion, noted cases of corrupt officials squandering funds, etc ì but far too few, especially those of the middle class who benefit most from energy subsidies, acknowledge the tremendous economic growth achieved under the current leadership and the success of their populist policies Najib s administration would do well to place greater emphasis on addressing the concerns of Malaysia s minorities who view affirmative action policies given to Malay ethnicities as disproportionate; income status, not ethnicity, should be a deciding factor in who receives assistance The current administration appears set to widen populist policies that make necessities affordable through subsidies and continue to assist low income earners with cash handouts Najib has acknowledged the need for broad reforms of Malaysia s state owned enterprises over concerns that crony capitalism may deter foreign investment; this should be rolled out concurrently with programs to foster more local entrepreneurship To put it bluntly, the opposition lacks confidence from the business community and foreign investors; even the likes of JP Morgan have issued statements of concern over an opposition win It should be noted that if Islamists ever wielded greater influence in Malaysia under an opposition coalition, one could imagine a sizable exodus of non Muslim minorities and a subsequent flight of foreign capital, putting the nation s economy in a fragile and fractured state And yet, the United States has poured millions into òdemocracy promotion efforts to strengthen the influence of NGOs that distort realities and cast doubt over the government s ability to be a coherent actor Malaysia does not have the kind of instability that warrants overt external intervention; backing regime change efforts may only go so far as supporting dissidents and groups affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim No matter the result of the upcoming elections, Najib appears to have played ball enough for Washington to remain more or less neutral According to Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, Malaysia s electoral process is so restrictive that a mass movement like Bersih is required to purge the system of its backwardness These are curious statements, considering that the opposition gained control of four out of 13 states in 2008, including Selangor, a key economic state with the highest GDP and most developed infrastructure In response, Najib has adhered to Bersih s demands and has called for electoral reform, forming a parliamentary select committee comprising members from both Pakatan Rakyat and Barisan Nasional As elections loom, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenavasan is already dubbing them the dirtiest elections ever seen ù ì unsurprising rhetoric from a woman being handed her talking points by the US embassy Nile Bowie for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-regime-change-871/

"1 Apr, 2012",Argentina: From Falklands Blitz to ‚ÄòTreaty of Versailles‚Äô,"Thirty years ago, Argentina s ruling regime occupied the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, only to surrender 74 days later to Margaret Thatcher s Task Force The defeat paved the way for Argentina s very own degrading Treaty of Versailles ù Failed DiplomacyMany may remember how Argentine General Leopoldo Galtieri s ruling Junta occupied the bleak Falkland/Malvinas Islands Maggie Thatcher immediately responded by deploying a 127 military and merchant vessel war flotilla The flotilla was spearheaded by the aircraft carriers Invincible and Hermes, which were loaded with dozens of fighter jets to take the islands back Or perhaps how US president Ronald Reagan s Secretary of State General Alexander Haig pretended he was a mediator ù in the conflict † All the while, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was releasing billions of dollars worth of war material and supplies aircraft, missiles, night goggles, millions of gallons of fuel, combat gear, and logistical support † America s urgent support of Britain s war effort also included the use of military satellites and US installations on Ascension Island in the Atlantic, located half way between London and the Falklands WarMany will also remember the bloody battles in the war zone that began on 2nd May 1982, when the British nuclear submarine Conqueror was ordered by Downing Street to sink the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano The strike resulted in the loss of 323 sailors, despite the fact it was sailing outside Britain s unilaterally declared Exclusion Zone ù around the islands † well away from the theatre of war Shortly thereafter, Argentina damaged many scores of British vessels, sinking the Sheffield, Atlantic Conveyor, Coventry, Ardent and Antelope In the end, 649 Argentine and 255 British troops died † The rest is history Thirty years on, we hear echoes of that conflict in Argentine president Cristina Kirchner s and British PM David Cameron s vulgar bickering over oil prospecting, oil rights, sovereignty, decolonization and the remilitarization ù of the South Atlantic As we said in our 11th February RT article British laughter in the Falkland Islands ù, this is much ado about nothing ùDefeatBecause the real crux of the matter is this as with all nations defeated at war by the UK, US, and its allies Argentina too had to suffer its Treaty of Versailles ù, much as defeated Germany suffered in 1919 at the end of World War I when they were made to bite the dust by those same victorious allies † The humiliating conditions caused such dreadful economic, financial, social and political devastation ensured Adolf Hitler and his movement would find massive popular support a few years later † Here too the rest is history But the Allies have learned many lessons since then † As with Germany, Austria, Japan, Italy and Iraq, Argentina too was punished However, instead of outright military invasion, Argentina was made to swallow a different but just as bitter pill The US/UK brand of democracy ù was imposed on us, lavishly financed by the Global Power Masters and their local satraps and forcefully drilled into every Argentine brain by the local and global mainstream media When that democracy ù was installed in December 1983, successive presidents from Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n ( Mr Hyperinflation 1989 ù), through Carlos Menem (local manager of Argentina s Treaty of Versailles ù) and Fernando De la R√∫a ( Mr Financial Meltdown 2001 ù), up to Nestor and Cristina Kirchner over the past nine years, all guaranteed the Global Power Masters that three things would happen:(1) Argentina would always kneel before its victorious vanquishers;(2) Argentina would never ever investigate the illegal origin of its sovereign debt under the generals, but instead would pay, pay and pay even more, and(3) Argentina would dismantle, disintegrate and destroy its armed forces in material and moral terms, so that in practice we have become a totally unarmed nation All of that stems from Argentina s Treaty of Versailles ù Thus president Alfons√≠n had thousands of military officers publicly tried for human rights violations; a necessary task no doubt, but the † vast, long term PsyWar exercise that followed resulted in the general public hating its military institutions rather than individual culprits † This all but destroyed the military † Also, imagine what would happen if US, British, French and Israeli military officers were publicly tried for their mass murders in Africa, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Serbia, Panama? † No, no, that s only done to defeated armies: German, Italian, Japanese, Arab, Argentine † And of course, one can expect the teary Hollywood History Fiction movie to follow Versailles revisitedActually, Argentina s Versailles has its own name: The Anglo Argentine Investments Promotion & Protection Treaty ù, which was signed in London in December 1990 and sanctioned on 4/11/1992 by Argentina s Congress as Law No 24 184 † It crowned a long series of talks held between Argentina and the UK, which in February 1990 had led to a formal Agreement whereby then president

General Leopoldo Galtieri s ruling Junta occupied the bleak Falkland/Malvinas Islands Maggie Thatcher immediately responded by deploying a 127 military and merchant vessel war flotilla The flotilla was spearheaded by the aircraft carriers Invincible and Hermes, which were loaded with dozens of fighter jets to take the islands back Or perhaps how US president Ronald Reagan s Secretary of State General Alexander Haig pretended he was a mediator ù in the conflict † All the while, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was releasing billions of dollars worth of war material and supplies aircraft, missiles, night goggles, millions of gallons of fuel, combat gear, and logistical support † America s urgent support of Britain s war effort also included the use of military satellites and US installations on Ascension Island in the Atlantic, located half way between London and the Falklands Many will also remember the bloody battles in the war zone that began on 2nd May 1982, when the British nuclear submarine Conqueror was ordered by Downing Street to sink the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano The strike resulted in the loss of 323 sailors, despite the fact it was sailing outside

11th February RT article British laughter in the Falkland Islands ù, this is much ado about nothing ù Because the real crux of the matter is this as with all nations defeated at war by the UK, US, and its allies Argentina too had to suffer its Treaty of Versailles ù, much as defeated Germany suffered in 1919 at the end of World War I when they were made to bite the dust by those same victorious allies † The humiliating conditions caused such dreadful economic, financial, social and political devastation ensured Adolf Hitler and his movement would find massive popular support a few years later † Here too the rest is history But the Allies have learned many lessons since then † As with Germany, Austria, Japan, Italy and Iraq, Argentina too was punished However, instead of outright military invasion, Argentina was made to swallow a different but just as bitter pill The US/UK brand of democracy ù was imposed on us, lavishly financed by the Global Power Masters and their local satraps and forcefully drilled into every Argentine brain by the local and global mainstream media When that democracy ù was installed in December 1983, successive presidents from Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n ( Mr Hyperinflation 1989 ù), through Carlos Menem (local manager of Argentina s Treaty of Versailles ù) and Fernando De la R√∫a ( Mr Financial Meltdown 2001 ù), up to Nestor and Cristina Kirchner over the past nine years, all guaranteed the Global Power Masters that three things would happen: (1) Argentina would always kneel before its victorious vanquishers;(2) Argentina would never ever investigate the illegal origin of its sovereign debt under the generals, but instead would pay, pay and pay even more, and(3) Argentina would dismantle, disintegrate and destroy its armed forces in material and moral terms, so that in practice we have become a totally unarmed nation All of that stems from Argentina s Treaty of Versailles ù Thus president Alfons√≠n had thousands of military officers publicly tried for human rights violations; a necessary task no doubt, but the † vast, long term PsyWar exercise that followed resulted in the general public hating its military institutions rather than

That s exactly what happened in Argentina in 2001 and 2002 ! ù A decade ago, Argentina too went through a systemic Sovereign Public Debt collapse resulting in social turmoil, worker hardship, rioting and street fights with the police †Some months before Argentina exploded, then President Fernando de la R√∫a forced to resign at the height of the 2001 crisis had called back as finance minister the notorious pro banker, Trilateral Commission member and Rockefeller/Soros/Rhodes prot√©g√©e Domingo Cavallo Cavallo was the gruesome architect of Argentina s political and economic capitulation to the US and UK when he was President Carlos Menem s foreign minister and economy minister in the 90s Menem and Cavallo are primarily responsible for Argentina s signing of a formal Treaty of Capitulation with the UK/US after the 1982 Falklands War, opening up our economy to unrestricted privatization, deregulation and grossly excessive US Dollar indebtedness, almost tripling our sovereign debt in a few short years (see my February 11, 2012 article British Laughter in the Falklands) †The Plan? Prepare Argentina for planned weakening, bankster take over and collapse, so that a new weakening takeover collapse cycle could begin † † In 2001, Cavallo was back to finish his work During that very hot summer in December 2001, true to its Latin temperament, Argentina even had four (yes, 4!) presidents in just one week † One of them, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, who only lasted three days, at least did one thing right, even if he did it the wrong way: he declared Argentina s default on its sovereign debt All hell broke loose! The international bankers and IMF did everything they could to break Argentina s back; global media pundits predicted all kinds of impending catastrophes Debt default meant Argentina would have to weather the pain and agony alone, being cast out by the international financial community ù But no matter how bad it got, it would always be better to do that without the bankers, without the IMF s, European Central Bank s, US Fed s and US Treasury s help ù † Better to sort out your mess on your own, than to have parasitic banker vultures carving out their pound of flesh from your nation s decaying social and economic body And how bad did it get in 2002? A 40 per cent drop in GDP; 30 per cent unemployment; 50 per cent of the population fell below the poverty line; dramatic, almost overnight, devaluation against the US Dollar from 1 peso per dollar to 4 pesos per dollar (then it tapered down to 3 pesos per dollar); if you had a US dollar Bank account, the government forced you to change it into pesos at the rate of 1 40 pesos per dollar What did Argentina s government do wrong? † In the months leading to collapse it bowed to all the bankers and IMF mandated measures and recipes ù, which were actually the very cause of collapse: Argentina was loaned far more than it could pay back † And the banker knew it! † This was described in our December 19, 2011 article, Argentina: Tango Lessons † Successive governments since then have continued to be functional to banker interests by rolling over debt 30 to 40 years, aggregating huge interest and in 2006 paying the full debt to the IMF almost US$10 billion in full, cash and in US dollars (sole entity given most favoured creditor status) Today, Greece is confronted with a similarly tough decision † Either it keeps its sovereignty, or it capitulates to the Vulture Troika ù the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund † who work for the Bankers, not the People Not surprisingly, today we find that Greece too has a Trilateral Commission Rockefeller/Rothschild man at the helm: Lucas Papademos who is doing the same things Argentina did in 2001/2 † † †Argentina not only suffered Cavallo, but President De la R√∫a himself was co founder of the local Global Power Masters lobby, CARI Argentine International Relations Council local branch of the New York based Council on Foreign Relations, networking with the Trilateral Commission / Bilderberg mafia Greece today should do what Argentina did a decade ago: better to endure pain and hardship, and sort out the mess made by your politicians in connivance with international bankers on your own, wielding whatever shred of sovereignty you still have than allowing the Banker Vultures sitting in Frankfurt, New York and London decide your future Or do you think it s just bad luck, bad judgment and coincidence that countries Greece, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Iceland, Ireland, Russia, Malaysia, Ukraine, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, France, even the US and UK always borrow too much from the bankers and then discover ù that they cannot pay it back and that, symmetrically, the same bankers CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche, Commerz, BNP, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorganChase, BBVA lend too much to countries and then discover ù they cannot collect?No! † That is the very yellow brick road that leads to the Emerald City of † debt restructuring ù, debt refinancing ù, and sovereign debt bond mega swaps ù that snowball sovereign debt, spreading it over 20, 40 or more years into the future That guarantees unimaginably colossal interest profits for the Mega Bankers and for all those nice politicians, media players, traders and brokers, without whom that would not be possible This is a Model † It must keep rolling and rolling and rolling As this Monster Machine steams forwards, it completely tramples on, overruns, destroys, flattens and obliterates people, jobs, workers, health services, pensions, education, national security and just about everything human on its path † Run by parasitic usurer technocrats, it does not care what it destroys because it has no ethics; no Christian, Muslim or Buddhist morals † It only worships a greedy golden idol of money, money and more money † This is 21st century Money Power Slavery †Three generations of Argentines saw hopes dashed and dreams thwarted by this Monster Machine, suffering the hardship, woes and humiliations that come when countries give up sovereignty So, Greece: Just default on your sovereign debt ù! † Just revert to the drachma! † Just say No, thanks! ù to the German bankers and the Troika Vultures † †Please, Greece: just say No! ù to your Trilateral Commission president! † †You will be setting a strong precedent for your European neighbours † Like Spain, which is hurting so badly right now for similar reasons † Like Italy, with its Trilateral Commission Prime Minister Mario Monti (also Trilateral s European Chairman!) †Greece, the Cradle of Democracy, can teach the world a lesson in True Democracy by kicking these parasites out of the country, which will hopefully trigger kicking them out of Europe and one day, kicking them out of the global economy Because what Greece and Argentina and Italy and Spain suffer today is not True Democracy, but rather a distorted bastard imitation that systematically yields control to the Global Power Masters at the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg and Mega Banking Overworld † They run the whole democracy show ù, whereby all countries end up having the best democracy that money can buy ù which is no democracy at all †The Money Power juggernaut is steaming full speed towards us all † If Greece falls, who ll be next?

"26 Jan, 2012",Chancellor Merkel oasis of calm among Eurozone firestorm,"Many were hoping for a bold move from Angela Merkel 
Instead, all they got from the German chancellor was a plea for time and calm Ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, there had been persistent rumours that Merkel would announce an injection of as much as half a trillion euros into the Eurozone s bailout fund Unable to repay its national debts, Greece is teetering on the brink of default, and Ireland and Portugal are not far behind But Merkel said that action just for the sake of reassuring the markets would not guarantee a sounder economy I would like to ask all of you who are here as the representatives of the business community to recognize how democratic governments work and to please take the long drawn out processes with a degree of acceptance, ù she told the audience of thousands of the world s top policy makers and business leaders on the first day of a five day conference in the Alpine resort Despite being urged to make more money available by IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Merkel also insisted that plucking billions in guarantees for struggling countries out of thin air would increase not minimise risks Some say that the size of the bailout fund needs to be doubled then if that s not big enough, others will say it has to be three times as big, ù Merkel said What we don t want is a situation in which we promise something that we can t back up ùInstead, Merkel proposed the twin solutions of greater integration and austerity As many have predicted the imminent collapse of the euro, Merkel said that it was the lack of co ordination between the European economies that split Europe into the haves and have nots The question is do we dare more Europe? Yes, we dare more Europe said the chancellor She also asked for more painful belt tightening from Europe s stragglers, while simultaneously admitting that it would be impossible to reduce the deficits plaguing the continent s poorest countries in one go ùDespite her lack of easy promises, Merkel s speech received positive, if mixed, reviews I do think there really is a shift in sentiment and perceptions, ù Oxford professor Timothy Garton Ash said at the conference The market sees that Germany is really willing to do what it takes to save the euro ùGerald Lyons, global chief economist at investment bank Standard Chartered, welcomed the call for structural economic reform another of Merkel s themes but warned that Europe s problems are still being misdiagnosed by most of their leaders Europe is focusing on the wrong problem, ù he told the Washington Post Clearly debt has to be brought down But Europe suffers from a lack of growth, not a high level of debt Basically you need to address the debt problem by focusing on growth ùBillionaire George Soros, a regular at the forum, was more critical The problem is that the austerity that Germany wants will push Europe into a deflationary death spiral The economy will contract and tax revenues will fall So the debt burden will actually rise, requiring further budget cuts and setting in motion a vicious cycle ùWhich of these opinions is closer to the truth will be borne out by the Eurozone economies, which are predicted to collectively plunge into recession this year   ",https://www.rt.com/business/davos-day-wrap-685/
"19 Dec, 2011",Argentina tango lessons: Europe‚Äôs turn for financial danse macabre?,"Exactly ten years ago Argentina suffered a full scale financial and governmental collapse That was the end result of over a decade of doing exactly what the IMF, international bankers, rating agencies and global experts ù told us to do Then President Fernando de la R√∫a kept applying all IMF recipes to the very last minute, making us swallow their poisonous remedies ù It all began getting really ugly in early 2001 when De la R√∫a could no longer service Argentina s sovereign debt ù even after driving the country into full deficit zero ù mode, slashing public spending, jobs, health, education and key public services By March 2001, he had brought back Domingo Cavallo as finance minister, a post Cavallo had already held for six years in the nineties under then President Carlos Menem, imposing outrageous IMF deregulation and privatization policies that weakened the state and led straight to the 2001 collapse Well, it wasn t really De la R√∫a who brought back Cavallo but rather David Rockefeller (JPMorgan Chase) and William Rhodes (CitiCorp), who personally came to Buenos Aires to tell/order President De la R√∫a to name Cavallo or else! So, by June 2001, Cavallo † a Trilateral Commission member and Soros Rockefeller Rhodes prot√©g√© † tried to allay a default by engineering a new sovereign debt bond mega swap which increased public debt by $51 billion, but did not avert total collapse that December What then? De la R√∫a and Cavallo protected the bankers, avoiding a massive run on all banks by freezing all bank deposits Corralito ù they called it † the crib ù † whereby account holders could only withdraw 250 pesos per week (at the time, equivalent to $250; after the 2002 devaluation, equal to $75) Argentina s economy all but collapsed; people took to the streets banging pots and pans, screaming and yelling, calling all bankers thieves, criminals, crooks, swindlers and robbers but the big mega bank bronze gates all remained tightly shut No one got their money back Half of bank deposits were in dollars Again, no one got their dollars back, but just as pesos at a fraudulent rate of exchange after devaluation had been imposed and Argentina s so called convertibility ù Currency Board that Cavallo had imposed a decade earlier pegging the peso to the dollar at an unrealisticone to one parity, was dropped Clearly,this was a massive banker orchestrated, government backed robbery of the assets and savings of 40 million Argentinians Half our population quickly fell below the poverty line, GDP contracted by almost 40% in 2002, millions lost their jobs, their savings, their homes to foreclosures, their livelihoods and yet not one single bank folded or collapsed!Amid rioting in Buenos Aires and major cities and brutal police repression that left 30 dead on the streets, De la R√∫a boarded his helicopter on the rooftop of the Casa Rosada ù presidential palace and abandoned ship That last week of December 2001, four presidents successively went by until finally the bankers, the media, and the US State and Treasury Departments accepted Eduardo Duhalde as provisional president He finally named finance minister Roberto Lavagna, a founding member of the local CARI, the Argentine Council on Foreign Relations, which is the local New York CFR branch Argentina was used as a testing ground by the global power elite to learn how a full scale financial, monetary, banking and economic collapse can be controlled and its social consequences suitably engineered to ensure that, with time: (a) the bankers came out unharmed, (b) democratic order ù is re instated and the new government imposes another sovereign debt mega swap, balance their numbers, and calm the people down (or else!), and (c) put big smiles back on bankster faces Business as usual!The lessons learned in Argentina in 2001/3 are today being used in Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Iceland, the UK and the US So, Occupy Wall Street ù demonstrators, lend me your ears! You haven t got a chance! The global money masters already made their financial war game exercise in Argentina At one point it got so bad that New York Times journalist Larry Rohter (later alleged by the Brazilian government to have ties with the CIA) had the gall to suggest the territorial break up of Argentina to solve ù our debt crisis The title of his perverse article, published on 27 August 2002, said it all: Some in Argentina see secession as the answer to economic peril ù, specifically targeting our natural resources rich Patagonian region Then, the global power elite finally got their man when N√©stor Kirchner became president in May 2003 Kirchner retained the finance minister, Lavagna, engineered yet another sovereign debt mega swap running 42 years into the future (!); he paid the IMF the full amount they claimed of $10 billion (in cash, in dollars and with no deductions; i e absolutely most favored creditor status!) getting nothing in return; he further weakened Argentina s military, dumbed down education, media and culture, and ended up imposing his wife Cristina as successor Clearly, lots of lessons were learned from the Argentine experience, ù which come in so handy when dealing with those rowdy, poorer Europeans today So, one decade on anyone for a tango?

"13 Jul, 2011",‚ÄúHundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis‚Äù,"The head of Russia s Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug related deaths since the beginning of this year At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses The reason for most drug related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world s third most heroin consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq Some people, such as Mr Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence For people not involved in gross drug related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0 2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan s enormous drug production As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000 kilometer border with Kazakhstan RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe Mostly it s the Netherlands, where most amphetamine based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels † Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it s nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical No, of course not We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers After all, people are not born addicted to drugs It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents That s when they get to know drugs If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No We are not talking about forced treatment here Any forced treatment is a violation of a person Therefore it s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21] They re punished, and then they re released Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment As I ve said, this is the so called alternative responsibility By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti drugs fundamental conventions RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in this commission I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US Russia Presidential Commission Mr Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we ve been discussing at various international platforms On May 10, I spoke at the G8 s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding This concept hasn t been developed yet In this context, I want to note that the former Under Secretary General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world s leading banks This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set They ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000 Now, they are planning to return these 30,000 So, in fact, nothing has changed I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference It s longer than World War II But the situation in Afghanistan hasn t improved, it has become even worse And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse It s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country So, it s a kind of closed circle In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy The operation was called Äòmashtarak which, if translated from Persian, means Äòtogether  The operation was presented as a brilliant military success Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary We ve started talking about this need at long last It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production I ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan The EU strategy matches very well a Russia drafted plan called ÄúRaduga 2 Äù to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action RT: Thank you very much for your interview VI: Thank you very much RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/hundreds-drug-money-pumped/

"10 Apr, 2011",George Soros looks to establish new global finance system,"A new global economic policy is on the table at a meeting in the American town of Bretton Woods Economists, finance experts and scholars from across the world are gathered at the conference, held by billionaire George Soros The chosen venue has great historic significance this was the setting of the famous Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, which set the monetary system for the world as we now know it This is where the International Monetary Fund and what is now the World Bank were established, with the US dollar becoming the reserve currency for the world at this same conference Back in 1944 it was the United Nations that got together the allied countries towards the end of World War II However, today it is a very different story This time it is billionaire George Soros bringing together two hundred intellectuals, with the belief that the current economic thinking and the current world monetary policy systems are no longer working Since the financial collapse shook the globe and reverberated all across the world, there hasn t been anything to replace the old system, something which might reflect the new world, where the US is not the one singular power that dictates economic policy The idea among the thinkers in Bretton Woods is that there needs to be a system which reflects the fact that we live in a multi polar world, a system which brings developing nations into the conversation Many of those nations with booming economies have become rivals to developed nations such as the United States So, you come to 2010, and for the first time virtually for nearly 200 years America and Europe that s the United States of America and the 27 members of the europeanunion , for the first time are being outproduced, outmanufactured and outexported, and also, interestingly, outinvested by the rest of the world, ù former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the conference One of the key problems economists are now facing is the necessity to develop new, more efficient, ways of dealing with enormous financial deficits, particularly America s skyrocketing debt The United States is paving the way with more than one trillion dollars of deficit each fiscal year, adding up to more than 14 trillion dollars in debt a problem which the US political leadership does seem to be eager to deal with Robert Johnson, the executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, George Soros think tank, which is leading the conference, in his opening speech questioned the effectiveness of current financial governance and called for measures to restore trust in the system At this time, I do not think people are trusting governments after financial bailouts I do not think they trust experts by and large That s the nature of the problem, that s why INET was formed, ù he told RT However, Johnson says it is not so easy to come up with a recipe to regain the trust of people who feel betrayed by the billion dollar bailouts around the world I m particularly concerned about the United States, which is at the center of the world system The middle class in the United States is feeling compressed They are experiencing what you might call a social death, while two to three per cent are doing very, very well, ù he continued Almost all of the gains from 1979 to the present, perhaps more than 100 per cent, have gone to the top one per cent, and that s just not sustainable, and that is not inspiring of trust ùCommenting on the current situation with the dollar as the world s reserve currency, Johnson said that the prevailing view among delegates at the conference is that the dollar is diminishing in significance for various reasons: The dollar is diminishing in significance, somewhat for natural reasons, because the United States is the smaller proportion of the world economy, as the emerging countries, like Russia, Brazil, India and China, grow, ù he said At the same time, Johnson continued, the dollar may be suffering from the fact that leaders in the United States have not paid enough attention to strengthening the underlying economic conditions, such as infrastructure, education, scientific research and maintenance of demand If you have a damaged and diminished population, damaged infrastructure and paltry or non existent investment, you are not going to have a strong economy, and the dollar will be a reflection of that, ù Robert Johnson concluded Gerald Epstein, Professor and Chair of Economics at the University of Massachussetts at Amherst, says emerging countries and financial regulators have much heavier responsibilities in the face of the global financial crisis We need global cooperation to get us out of that current crisis, but also to help us to make a transition to a new type of economy where power is more widely dispersed around the world, ù he said, an economy that can deal with climate change and make the green transition that we need ù Roman Frydman, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that the BRICS countries are accounting for an increasingly larger part of world consumption US consumption, by some estimates, is expected to go down to as little as 20 percent, ù he said And Europe will be another 20 percent And the rest of the world will be about 60 percent

There is going to be a currency re valuation across the globe The dollar would probably be cut in half versus made of the trading currencies Gold in particular will have to be, as it was in the 30s, valued upward Gold and precious metals and any currency that brings in to the basket of commodities or precious metals as the basis of the currency will in concert I believe move 50 60% in one day or one week or may move over 100% in a week This means that all the currencies will be revalued against gold And the currency which will lose the most would be the US dollar So for people like in America, as it happened in other countries † like Iceland recently, or other bail out countries from the IMF, or in Russia, or in the UK in the 70s † suddenly people wake up and the currency is devalued by 50% Everything at the store costs double or triple or quadruple and there is nothing they can do about it Because it s not like these things happening according to a carefully coordinated plan by the banking establishment around the world that is setting this all up to go It is going to be practically effortless on their part I was impressed how Europe embraced the Euro The logistics of converting all these currencies to the Euro was a pretty amazing job So think about this new currency grade happening very quickly in all the currencies had a new relative value versus commodities Of course the US won t be happy about that but most of the major wealth in the US will be outside of the US by then RT: You say that people are pulling money out of America Do you have any data to spot this? MK: The data as you see is in the price of gold bullion for one thing, but all this talk about deflation and GDP is contracting and the economics are slowing down You still have the price of gold doing very well You also see the currencies outside the US start to break way from the US dollar And they are doing pretty well, currencies like New Zealand and Australia start to come back in a huge way They start to outperform the US right now The US is standing back a bit, but there are some countries which are doing much better The Russian Stock market is doing fantastically well They ve got resources, good infrastructure, great relationships with China, Iran, Brazil and some other countries They are positioning themselves as hot assets The US dollar based post WWII, IMF, World Bank a phantasmagorical world of never having to pay your debts is coming to a close And ones it happens you want to be on the right side of that trade RT: Are you prepared to stick out your neck and say by this date will be doomsday for America as you call it? MK: In the US the number that I would look at is the unemployment number, it is continuing to creep up, the wage number is continuing to go down on an hourly basis and even if you want to play with the numbers on employment and unemployment and there s a lot of ways that these statistics are cooked and arranged, the basic hourly wage number is continuing to deteriorate, so at some point there will be a critical mass of unemployed people in America who will then I think spontaneously, as it happens in other countries, will suddenly have to decide that this is it, that we can t take it anymore The honeymoon of Barack Obama seems to be entering a new phase where people are less excited by his program of change because they do not see any change in the banking system and the bankers are still very much pilfering and very much stealing and they want more power So its tough to say exactly when that spark will hit that ignites the Hindenburg of social unrest in the US but I do not think that at this point you can reverse it, there s nothing that can be done to reverse this inevitable collision and I think that also one of the amazing stories of 9/11 is how, when the 9/11 disaster hit, is really the beginning when the wealthiest in America start to move their money out of the US That was what they learnt that the US isn t really safe for my money anymore and they started to move their money out of US aggressively since 9/11 a lot of the complications and the reason why Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates down to 1 percent after 9/11 was in a large part to assist the wealthiest of America in moving all their capital out of America RT: Tell us more about the KarmaBanque that you've created MK: KarmaBanque is like what if Gandhi and George Soros had a love child, basically What I did was I figured out which companies, if a large boycott were enacted, would have the greatest impact on their share price, which companies market capitalization is most weighted toward a consumer boycott that would cause major damage So a company like Exxon is not particularly vulnerable to consumer boycott, cause they re diversified in many ways, their stock doesn t trade in the high multiple of retail sales But a company like Coca Cola is very vulnerable to boycott The second turbo charged aspect to the KarmaBanque methodology, is that if people decide that they re going to boycott a product like a Coca Cola, it will have an effect on their revenues and profits In America, they re used to the idea of if I like the company, I ll buy the stock So this is just the opposite: I don t like the company, I m going to boycott the stock to the point where hedge funds start selling short that stock RT: Some people call you a financial terrorist How do you respond to that? MK: That would be incorrect What I am suggesting cannot be considered financial terrorism It can be considered economics Because what I m saying is that a lot of these companies have unrealized risk that s not reflected in their own balance sheet which is descent risk I m making that risk visible, and by making this risk visible and quantifying it should be reflected in the stocks price Hedge funds and other big institutions like pension funds looking for ways to increase returns to help those people who benefit from their accounts in these large institutes will benefit from this approach RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/wealthiest-america-start-move/
