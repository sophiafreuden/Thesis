"16 Jan, 2021",America 2.0: After the election,"It is commonly acknowledged that the biggest economies have a major influence on political and social development of other countries ByDmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia s president from 2008 to 2012 and prime minister from 2012 to 2020 He has been deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation since January 2020 Crisesthat they periodically go through affect †the global economy and consequently have impact on regional and national economies, as well as on political systems of countries that are sensitive to such impact Yet, it is often overlooked that certain political events, such as elections, can also provoke serious crises in other countries That is especially so when countries that have a direct influence on the fundamental global processes are concerned In this context, it is worth taking a look at the recent US presidential election It is not that this presidential campaign, likely the most scandal ridden in history, proved that the flaws in the US electoral system have a comprehensive nature That is no news In fact, the strengths and shortcomings of the US voting system could be regarded as a purely domestic issue But there is one problem Elections in this country, especially when there is a transfer of power from one political force to the other, can trigger significant changes in the global economic development, seriously affecting the existing institutions of international law and global security system Many US leaders have at various times admitted, including to me personally, It is true that our system is not perfect, but we are used to it and it is convenient for us ù The problem is that the rest of the world finds it increasingly inconvenient ùto work with such a country, as the US becomes an unpredictable partner This unpredictability gives other states, regional associations and military political organizations cause for concern It would be nice if the US political establishment realized this responsibility Let us take a closer look At first, everything seems quite presentable: alternative candidates, primary elections, and live TV debates But this is a fa√ßade, a nice stage set which determines the spectacularity of the event and, naturally, the preferences of the voters In the US electoral system, a candidate who wins a relative majority in a particular state even by a slight margin almost always gets all the electoral votes for that state Therefore, in traditionally liberal or conservative states, votes cast by those who support the other party virtually disappear, being reduced to zero As far as recent history is concerned, Democratic nominees Albert Gore (2000) and Hillary Clinton (2016) lost the election, despite having won the most votes Since the existing system awards all the electoral votes to the winner, a candidate who won by a small margin in states with a total of 271 electoral votes may win an election, despite having lost by a landslide in other states In theory, even a candidate who won the popular vote by more than 100 million ballots may still lose the election in the electoral vote On top of that, there is another significant shortcoming in the Electoral College system, where an elector has a right to cast their vote sometimes without any serious consequences for someone other than the candidate they have pledged to represent in accordance with the will of the voters Instances of faithless voting by electors have occurred with regular frequency For example, in 2016 two Texas electors refused to cast their vote for Donald Trump, although such incidents have never changed the outcome of a presidential election Now, pending the official results of the election, the winner take all principle rather fairly has come under a new wave of criticism Even Hillary Clinton, who ran against Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has called for abolishing the Electoral College and selecting a president by the winner of the popular vote, same as every other office Otherwise, there is a difficult situation where tens of millions of voters do not believe that the outcome of the election reflects the actual will of the people Moreover, the US citizens themselves have called into question their country s conformity with the main criterion of democracy the ability of the state to ensure fair and transparent expression of the people s will in general This is an urgent issue the United States has to deal with The nation is divided, the fault line running between people of different value orientations, which reflect on the electoral choice between Republicans and Democrats There is a clear value divide ù between conservative Americans and those who promote change in traditionalist attitudes, between law abiding ù Americans and those who support active street protest, between those employed in high tech industry and those left out of the technological revolution Besides, the election race laid bare the tensions between the federal government and state and local governments Accusations against the federal government of exceeding its authority in using force to suppress riots have exposed cracks in American federalism, which the central government (regardless of party affiliation) prefers to conceal as far as possible There have also been large scale violations of the election law The United States still has no standard procedures for voter registration, voter identification, ballot issuance and submission According to the nonprofit organization Judicial Watch, by September 2020, 29 out of 37 states had 1 8 million more registered voters than actual eligible voting age citizens This is largely due to the fact that there is no such concept as a domestic passport or some kind of residence registration in the US, so when shifting their place of residence, people often fail to remove themselves from the voter list In addition, there were occasions of people who had long since died having voted for one of the candidates However, courts found no evidence that such cases had been widespread they were often down to the fact that other family members have similar names, which led to errors in the voter records Statistics show that there were 153 million registered voters in the US in 2018, with more than 20 million entries in the voter rolls being out of date According to the California Globe, an NGO, there were nearly half a million such entries in California alone in 2020 In this context, a large scale campaign was launched urging voters to update their data in the voter lists The most acute situation arose as a result of the mass postal voting, which brought Joe Biden a reported majority during the counting of ballots It is not even that Democrats created a controversial opportunity to gain votes from a passive part of their electorate, using the pandemic as an excuse They encouraged a more active use of the mail in voting procedure, which had been widely used only in some states during previous campaigns According to Donald Trump, this paved the way to uncontrolled machinations Thus, on the eve of voting day, the democraticparty allegedly attempted to change the procedure for counting postal ballots in the states of Wisconsin, Indiana, North Carolina, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Alabama in order to considerably lengthen the period of their acceptance This made it possible to relax the monitoring requirements for vote counting Consequently, once the voting was over, the Republicans almost immediately announced that they were filing lawsuits in connection with violations registered in 40 states Lawyers representing the Republicans found it unsound that so many states had continued to count the votes for several days after voting day They had some serious questions as to the legitimacy of accepting the late ballots Nevertheless, courts rejected most of the filed lawsuits even in Republican states All of this is hardly consistent with those norms of democracy that Washington arrogantly imposes on other countries For instance, US officials in the OSCE constantly point to the need for the OSCE participating states to comply with the recommendations by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) drawn up based on the results of its election observation activities In the meantime, the US itself fails to act on the relevant recommendations, blatantly violating the provisions of para 8 of the 1990 Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE and para 25 of the 1999 Charter for European Security stipulating the obligation to invite observers for monitoring national elections Since 2002, the ODIHR election observation missions in the US have recommended in their final reports that international observers be provided with access to all states at the federal level However, that is not what we see in reality Besides, the archaic US electoral system is such that the US federal government has no powers to establish procedures even for federal elections as this is the prerogative of the states Just as when America was a farmers republic with a population of 3 5 million, the president is still elected by the states, which inform the Congress of their decisions through the electoral college During the popular vote in 2016, the ODIHR did not have access to polling stations in 17 states The international observers, who showed legitimate interest in the elections on the voting day, faced threats of arrest and indictment In the 2020 popular vote, the number of inhospitable ù states reached 18 Only five states and the District of Columbia have legal provisions in place ensuring international election observation In all other states, it remains at the discretion of the local authorities and is quite unpopular The lengthy disputes over the election results in courts (and, at the end of the day, electing a new president there) is yet another fact demonstrating how inefficient and outdated this voting system is In the 2000 campaign, the votes cast for George W Bush and his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, in Florida were recounted multiple times It was the Supreme Court that had the last word, ruling that the vote recounting should stop, which meant the victory of George W Bush even though many Americans still doubt the validity of that decision But at the time, such a timely consensus between the Republicans and the Democrats was exactly what was needed to quickly stabilize the situation The enormous costs associated with such a voting system have by now practically erased the word consensus ù from the vocabulary of the American political elite Just recently, no one could imagine not even in their worst nightmares that all these partisan differences would lead to the storming of the Capitol, whose first foundation stone was laid by the first US president, George Washington The attack carried out by pro Trump protesters while the Congress was counting votes not only appalled national governments all over the world but provoked bloodshed in the country, which was only recently seen by many as the gold standard of democracy It was hard to believe that the events resembling so much Ukraine s Maidan and other color revolutions that unfolded in recent years across a wide range of countries, including those in the post Soviet space, were broadcasted live from the United States all over the world The techniques previously used by Washington for democratization of other countries backfired The cold civil war that had been raging in the US for a few months reached its climax And while the world is condemning the attack on the Capitol, anxiously waiting for what is to come next, it is as yet unclear how the Republicans and the Democrats are supposed to find common ground The social polarization keeps growing The long forgotten spirit of McCarthyism is again felt in the air And there is no one who could answer the question: are there a person and a timeless value that could unite the nation The situation that has been brought about by a chain of events predetermined by the archaic voting system can lead to new waves of violence and unrest On the other hand, the American political system has proved its flexibility over the course of centuries I am sure this time it will cope, too There is one more critical issue which, in the context of the outdated American electoral system, has moved extremely high up the agenda I am talking about the unprecedented role in public politics of social networks and new media, and, accordingly, of private IT companies that own those platforms Conventional American media, whose activities are regulated by laws and fall within the First Amendment, have traditionally and always officially taken the side of a certain candidate and yet deemed it necessary to give coverage to statements made by the opponent during election and post election campaigns The social media, however, are beyond any special regulations and work on the basis of user agreements And it was them that unleashed the media war without rules! And that war is waged against one single person During the vote counting, Trump s posts on Twitter, where he has over 85 million followers, were flagged as potentially misleading and later even hidden The events in the Capitol resulted in the unprecedented and permanent suspension of Trump s accounts on all social media where he has a total of about 200 million followers Noteworthy is that the tone of the posts that provoked the suspension of Trump s accounts was not much different from his narrative of the preceding weeks Next, they blocked tens of thousands of supporters of the incumbent president across all kinds of platforms which used to be viewed as forums for a full fledged discussion For America, just as for the rest of the world, this level of corporate censorship is a truly extraordinary phenomenon A question arises: who are those supreme judges that decided that they, of their own volition and based on their own rules but, in fact, guided by their political preferences, can deprive the country s president of the opportunity to communicate with an audience of many millions? Whether Trump is good or bad, he is his country s national, and, furthermore, an official who enjoys the trust of nearly half of Americans Thus, it turns out that several technological corporations located in California got an appetite for power and thought it possible to juggle with news and facts to suit their own political preferences This is but a blatant censorship! Dictating their own terms, they have sought to substitute for state institutions, encroaching on their mandates, aggressively imposing their views on a great number of people, leaving them no other choice; while the 75 million of Trump s voters and hundreds of millions of his subscribers were left out of their choice ù These were simply labeled as insecure Isn t it, indeed, a spectre of cyber totalitarianism that is gradually overwhelming society, taking away from it (and potentially the entire world) the opportunity to see the reality for what it is? But even if Donald Trump leaves politics for good and the tech giants wipe out his digital footprint, the minds will remain hugely polarized This is yet another problem stemming from the US s outdated voting system, and it will push governments of different countries into action to prevent the same scenario in their own states Given the special place of the US in the architecture of international relations, all this makes us try and guess the impact of the elections on the classical ù world politics as well as economy It is crystal clear that the elections influence direct trends in global development Everything else, with certain reservations, can be regarded as an internal affair of the US itself Yet outward effects are our common issue Let me remind you that George W Bush s victory back in 2000 caused significant, though short term, volatility on stock markets It is equally possible after the current shock, which of course provides considerable grounds for concern But the long term stability of the US dollar will be largely determined by the resilience of institutions for the protection of property rights, the demand for American goods and services in the global market, as well as the predictability and independence of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), which underpins the confidence in the US dollar US dollar volatility will abruptly increase only if US manufacturers lose a considerable share of the world market or investors doubt the existing safeguards for the protection of assets, the relevance and soundness of the FRS s long term policy Since this is impossible in the near future, it seems of much more interest to us what Joe Biden s economic policy will look like And this is often shaped based on the thesis just not the way Trump would have it ù It s some sort of a tradition: the same way, the 45th president without hesitation reversed the 44th President Barack Obama s directives on all tracks It is obvious that the development of a national legal and political system is the sovereign choice of a state itself, though many countries (and first of all the US) are seeking to impose their model of development on the world as the most effective Certainly, there is no legal and political system that can be called the monument of classical ù democracy It is constantly developing and improving The question is, how relevant and timely the models that are offered as a replacement for those that have lost their progressive potential are And here what we need is a combination of sound conservatism and well timed new laws Both artificial preservation of and constant experimentation with political and legal realities pose a danger The post Soviet nations have the examples of both, state regimes sometimes transiting from the presidential system to parliamentary and back once every two or three years Governments in many countries are posing questions about the policy continuity of such an important actor in world affairs as the US The 2016 elections shattered the century long tradition of continuity of the administrations, particularly in foreign policy issues This time, again, the US stance on a range of key issues depends on the election results Where shall we witness a reverse in policy, a getting around to approaches adopted by Barack Obama and his predecessors administrations? Let us take a look at the critical issue of fighting against the coronavirus The 2020 candidates opposing viewpoints regarding the danger of Covid 19 will lead to an expanded scope and increased stringency of pandemic related measures implemented in the US as one of the main short term effects of the election outcomes This will influence the lives and health of Americans as well as the well being of citizens in neighboring countries and the US allies The polarization among citizens themselves, when you could tell with great certainty by the presence or absence of a mask which party the voter has voted for, was grotesque indeed The two candidates have adopted very different approaches when addressing relevant economic issues inside the country, which have a direct influence on the entire world One should note, among many other things, that Donald Trump repeatedly commented on the FRS activities that lay outside the mandate of the head of state This caused a certain dollar skepticism in view of a possible loss by the FRS of its actual independence of the executive power, which triggered a discussion on the excessive dependence of trade on the US dollar even among the US allies in the EU The reaction of American markets and the actual recognition by Donald Trump of his defeat was clearly reflected, for example, in the S&P 500 November 2020 turned out the best November for the main US stock market index And for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the month was the best since 1987 The indices were undoubtedly influenced by the positive news about vaccines against Covid 19, but the growth began immediately after the election results were announced Support for international organizations (WHO, WTO, and others) turned into a bargaining chip in the presidential election results issue For decades, the US has increased its weight in these organizations And until recently, the attitude toward them has not depended on a certain administration in the White House These elections will inevitably lead to the restoration of the US full membership and the development of cooperation within international organizations such as the WHO and the WTO The outgoing administration has been notorious for its abrupt and hardly predictable demarches regarding its participation in such associations, which certainly destabilized their work Yet the US s financial support is crucial and very significant for them Even more important is the US participation in international arms agreements, such as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START III) and the Treaty on Open Skies (OST), as well as in different integration alliances, climate accords and many others As in the case of international organizations, the US is trying to restore to a certain extent its image as a reliable strategic partner Election pledges to extend the START III treaty with Russia which Biden called an anchor of strategic stability between the United States and Russia, ùsound very optimistic The president elect is an advocate of arms reduction and has been involved in drafting the INF Treaty since the Soviet era One of the election campaign themes was that the US should not withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement processes that have been set in motion in recent years By the way, the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement and its expected new accession to it is one of the clearest and most recent examples of political turmoil There is now a tectonic change in the very basis of economic activity A new economic order is taking shape States and individual companies are reshaping their models to be carbon neutral, carrying out rigorous assessment of their business chains starting from suppliers in some countries to consumers in others Global investors are rethinking their strategies International organizations are shaping new reporting standards that will obviously apply globally Finally, most recently the UN Secretary General called on all nations to rethink their tax strategies by cutting taxes on income while raising taxes on carbon All of these factors are of global importance And the US position, or rather its floundering, can obviously create new global imbalances Although everyone will adapt to them after a while, because, as T Dreiser wrote, you have to take things as they are and use them to your best advantage ù Building relations with their allies, especially in NATO, is another basic factor that directly influences the trajectory of international development The Biden administration which is largely made up of the key figures from the Obama administration has already assured its European partners that full cooperation within the North Atlantic Alliance will be restored The US is expected to drop its claims about the disproportionately small contribution of Europeans to NATO funding and the imbalance in military budgets, which have been repeatedly voiced by the Trump administration Time will show to what extent the trust of the US European allies will be regained But it is clear that the US foreign policy somersaults over a relatively short period of time will not go unnoticed Even on the issue of interaction with China the candidates have managed to take generally opposing positions Although both share the opinion that China is America s main competitor As part of the election campaign, Biden s rhetoric toward China was significantly more peaceful in comparison to Trump s promises and actions However, trade restrictions imposed by the Trump administration may remain in place in the new circumstances if the situation requires so The experience of the Jackson Vanik amendment and other sanctions laws shows that such restrictions can persist for a long time, even after the reason for their imposition has disappeared We expect it is highly likely that the United States will consistently pursue an anti Russian policy In recent years, the trajectory of relations between Washington and Moscow has been steadily going downhill, no matter who was at the helm in the White House There was indeed some hope of reversing the negative dynamics during the Trump presidency After all, back in 2016, it seemed that relations between the two countries could not be any worse than those under B Obama However, the following years have dispelled this illusion The Trump administration consistently strengthened the systemic confrontation between Washington and Moscow, continued its sanctions policy against our country wishing, inter alia, to force it out of the energy markets, and reduced our diplomatic contacts to a minimum And this was done against the background of D Trump constantly speaking about the desire to get along with Russia ùHis words did not matter much, however, as numerous restrictive measures in Congress were supported by both Democrats and Republicans Biden has not yet said anything positive about Russia On the contrary, his rhetoric has always been openly unfriendly, harsh, even aggressive He has repeatedly stated that Russia is the biggest threat to the United States in terms of undermining our security and alliances ùNothing more, nothing less Moreover, the Democrats team includes politicians who hold similar views and have no interest whatsoever in improving relations between Moscow and Washington Russia, on the contrary, is ready to work with any US president, ready to restore cooperation in a wide range of areas However, we can hardly expect any reciprocal steps from the new American administration Our relations are likely to remain extremely cold in the coming years And right now we do not expect anything but the continuation of a tough anti Russian policy But perhaps Biden will revisit the issues still on our joint agenda, for example arms control I have listed only a few areas which will obviously be among those deserving special attention Most importantly: the unpredictability of further US actions in the international arena, a kind of toxicity of this country even for its allies and partners is a result of serious social upheavals that American society faces This internal and external instability is largely due to a clumsy, hopelessly outdated voting system that has seen no major changes since the 18th century up to the present And the last election turned out to be not a political competition of ideas that the US had always prided itself on, but rather a confrontation between two campaigns of hatred We do not want the US to have problems And for practical reasons: such problems create waves of instability all around that overflow us as well The problems of the United States can only be solved by the Americans themselves along with the good governance of the country One of the founding fathers of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, rightly noted that the whole art of government consists in the art of being honest ùAny election is the most important test of such honesty Of course, only Americans themselves can decide whether to put aside their national selfishness and launch the voting system reform, and, consequently, the reform of political life, or not So far, there has been no real move toward this Nor even the slightest hint of a desire to change anything And the international community is already paying too high a price for the US reluctance to change",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/512700-america-election-dmitry-medvedev/
"28 Oct, 2020",Endangering European security: Joe Biden's assertion that Russia is number one 'threat' to US flies in face of all facts & reason,"Joe Biden s belief that Russia is the greatest danger to the US is based on emotion and outdated ideology It should alarm Europeans as they could find themselves on the frontline of a struggle that makes little or no sense ByGlenn Diesen, an Associate Professor at the University of South Eastern Norway and aneditor at the Russia in Global Affairs journal Follow him on Twitter @glenndiesen US presidential challenger Joe Biden recently referred to Russia as the main threat to the US The statement perplexed some observers given how his former boss Barack Obama dismissed Russia as a weak regional power in 2014, while in 2012 Obama himself had mocked Mitt Romney for arguing that Russia was America s number one geopolitical foe Biden, the †erstwhile †vice president of Obama, has now seemingly made a complete reversal Remarkably, Russia has become the primary threat to the US without Washington clearly defining the rivalry The vague references to Russia plotting against America, undermining democracy or being anti Western have the common denominator of lacking coherence and conceptual clarity What confrontation spawned this threat? The Russian threat argument is founded on the narrative that Putin † apparently reversed the supposedly Western friendly policies of Yeltsin and reignited confrontation Yet, what exactly would pro Western policies entail? Yeltsin pursued a radical pro Western †platform, accepting unilateral concessions and a demeaning student teacher relationship vis √† vis the West, in the belief that a Greater Europe would be constructed However, the West looked at a weakened Russia and decided to construct a new Europe without Moscow Through expansionism, NATO and the EU have become the main institutions to represent the continent and any Russian resistance is depicted as ambitions to restore the Soviet Empire Yeltsin s entire foreign policy platform subsequently collapsed before he brought Putin to power to reform the untenable policies toward the West Putin continued to push for a Greater Europe, although from a position of strength by rejecting unilateral concessions and being socialized or civilized by the West However, the West continues to conceptualize Yeltsin s pro Western policies as a capitulation by forfeiting any role for Russia in Europe Revisionism is the main concept that informs the West s threat analysis of Russia States can be divided into status quo powers, which seek to preserve the international system as it is, and revisionist powers that aim to overturn the status quo Depicting Russia as a revisionist power for opposing NATO and EU expansionism is the great paradox that defines European security Irrespective of any benign intentions, the EU and NATO are revisionist by being the main vehicles to reorganize Europe These two institutions push the dividing lines on the continent to the East and impose a destabilizing civilizational choice on the divided societies positioned between the West and Russia NATO and the EU did not simply create an unfavorable status quo for Russia, they rejected the establishment of a new status quo order by rejecting any limitations to their expansion For centuries the West was concerned that the Russian Empire did not have any natural borders and expanded by impulse, yet in the post Cold War era, this revisionist itch describes the West The failure to recognize Russia as a status quo power has continuously produced flawed predictions In August 2008, Russia intervened in South Ossetia to repel an invasion by Georgia, which had been promised by NATO in April 2008 it would become a member of the military bloc While Western media and politicians predicted that Russia would conquer Tbilisi and possibly annex Georgia, Russia merely restored the status quo of an autonomous South Ossetia In March 2014, Russia responded to the Western backed toppling of Yanukovich by †reabsorbing †Crimea Again, Western pundits warnings of Russia seeking to conquer Kiev and restore the Soviet empire proved to be wrong Russia cemented its control over its strategic naval base in Crimea, which it already controlled before the Maidan Russia s intervention in Syria in 2015 was similarly designed to preserve the status quo, aimed against US efforts to topple the Syrian government in a wider revisionist effort to reorganize the power balance in the region Russia s alleged effort to restore the Soviet empire similarly lacks coherence The accusation evokes familiar and powerful Cold War connotations that can mobilize political support and resources among NATO states However, what exactly does it mean to restore the Soviet empire and why would Russian tanks enter Warsaw? Moscow is not led by communists seeking to rid the world of capitalism Russia has neither the interest nor capacity to control a foreign population that does not want to live within Russian borders How did this absurd concept end up dominating the Western discourse? Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred in 2012 to the Customs Union and the pending Eurasian Economic Union as an effort to re Sovietize the region ùand proclaimed Washington s intention to slow it down or break it up The Eurasian Economic Union is not devoted to world revolution, rather it is a voluntary international institution largely modelled after the EU, which mostly focuses on facilitating free movement of people, goods, services and capital Does the reference to the Soviet Union help us to understand the Eurasian Economic Union in any way, or does it merely revive the inference of incompatible values and threats? The effort to make Russia fit in the clothes of the Soviet Union also manifests itself in the constant accusation of Moscow attempting to establish a sphere of influence, which implies a region of exclusive influence Is the pot calling the kettle black? Moscow s main argument under its Greater Europe Initiative has been to end bloc politics in Europe and replace it with mutual accommodation and harmonization of interests Before the toppling of Yanukovich, Moscow and Kiev proposed a trilateral EU Russia Ukraine trade commission to avoid zero sum formats of exclusive influence The EU Commission president denounced the proposal by Moscow and Kiev as unacceptable and insisted that Ukraine had to choose and make the right decision Similarly, Russian influence in the Western Balkans is frequently denounced as an unacceptable intrusion into the EU s backyard EU and NATO policies inevitably become a struggle for spheres of influence as there is no conceptual space for legitimate Russian influence beyond its borders The Sovietization thesis also explains why the West s prediction about a Russian Chinese clash over Central Asia did not materialize Unlike the West, Beijing has not defined its strategy in the post Soviet space as saving the region from Russia As both Russia and China do not demand exclusive influence in the region, a partnership has developed based on mutual recognition of legitimate interest Biden s antagonistic remarks about Russia should create concerns about the future of European security The ideological language and reluctance to address Russian security interests results in an inaccurate interpretation of Moscow s intentions while leaving no prospect for a compromise Russian security concerns and interests never enter the discourse in the West, and competition is subsequently interpreted solely as incompatible values When competing security concerns are identified, compromise is the path to peace However, when competing interests are clothed in the language of incompatible values, compromise is tantamount to appeasement and treason There is subsequently no prospect for a solution to this impasse, and peace demands nothing less than victory ",https://www.rt.com/russia/504691-threat-rivalry-confrontation-policies/
"12 Aug, 2020","Too little, too late ‚Äì but the open letter ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs time to rethink our Russia policy‚Äô at least opens the free-speech gates in the US","A group of 103 international relations scholars has called for change in America s course on Russia in an open letter titled It s time to rethink our Russia policy One is tempted to respond simply, No sh*t ù ByGordon M Hahn, Ph D, Expert Analyst atCorr Analytics& Senior Researcher at the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies (CETIS), Akribis Group Dr Hahn is the author of the forthcoming book: The Russian Dilemma: Aspiration, Trepidation, and the West in the Making of Russia s Security Culture (McFarland, 2021) More appropriately, such a call might have been a surprise, but it has been needed since about 1992 It s not only the text that s comment worthy; the group of signatories is of some interest, too Some of the statement s backers possess a sound record of sincere support for a realist or at least reasonable American policy towards Russia Indeed, at least one of them, Dmitry Simes, has been accused of being a Kremlin asset in the Soviet vigilante style of US media copiously on display during the Russiagate hysteria However, many are partly responsible for the sad state of US Russian relations in having supported some of the worst aspects of America s Russia policy Some are only narrowly or casually familiar with Russian politics, and many are compromised by the specific nature of their deep involvement in American politics Consequently, their collective statement has both weak and strong points Most disappointingly, the latter do not go far enough Therefore, it s unlikely their call for a new Russia policy will impart the necessary drive for a significant revamp of US policy and will have little demonstrable effect on US Russian relations It will have equally limited impact on the already hyper cynical Russian elite s view of the American policymaking circle s own cynicism, biases, insufficient knowledge, and considerable Russophobia Its most positive effect may be in preventing the complete monopolization by the most jaundiced perception of Russia, gradually establishing a stranglehold on US discourse about Russia But let s review the statement s actual content Unfortunately, one has the sinking feeling, or at least fear, that the appearance of the letter in the midst of the US presidential election campaign reveals that the authors are issuing a subtle rebuke to President Donald Trump, for such a statement should have come during every previous US administration Only a few of the signatories protested the more hawkish aspects of America s Russia policy in any fundamental way in those periods; examples are former Defense Secretary William Perry and, paying a price, Simes On the other hand, it could reflect, most of all, real alarm over the dangerous NATO Russia confrontation in western Eurasia and the dissolution of arms control and non proliferation regimes, and thus constitute a helping hand in any Trump effort to reverse the course of the democraticparty s failed policies and Russia hysteria Indicative of just how far intellectual and ethical rot in has penetrated the Washington elite even without reference to the impending Epstein pedophile scandal, the Bidens Ukraine corruption, the Clintons unique brand of across the board corruption, or the Obamas cryptic or stealth like undermining of the rule of law is that the authors are finally compelled to do something they should have done at least a decade ago on an individual basis during geostrategic catastrophes such as NATO expansion, which represented the triumph of blind hubris over statesmanship and vision inside the Beltway America s devolution is most evident in the co signatories felt need to appeal for something that should be a matter of course in government, intelligence, research institutes, and the media: careful, dispassionate analysis ùIn particular, they hope to generate this imperative ùin service of another a change of our current course ùin relating to Russia Indeed, in recent decades, Russia studies, perhaps more than any other policy or research area, have been held captive by domestic politics, rampant careerism, intellectual corruption, and the destructive force of political correctness in American academia, mainstream media, think tank and intelligence analyses Pervasive enough under Clinton and Bush, these cancerous cells metastasized into full blown tumors spreading uncontrollably through the American body politic after the arrival of Barack Obama The resulting nearly universal demand for thought slavery and uniformity has, for at least a decade, been ubiquitous in the very academic, media, analytical, and government milieu within which the signatories have long circulated While those who spoke out were being run out of these institutions, very few if any of the signatories spoke out and some were complicit in the poisoning of the American mind Also, continued foreign policy hubris and arrogance is inferable from the document s following statement: Russia complicates, even thwarts, our actions, especially along its extended periphery in Europe and Asia It has seized territory in Ukraine and Georgia It challenges our role as a global leader and the world order we helped build It interferes in our domestic politics to exacerbate divisions and tarnish our democratic reputation ù Lacking in this list of Russian behaviors and the statement as a whole is any kind of mea culpa any acknowledgement of Washington s and Brussels even greater responsibility for the sad state of US Russian and US Western relations than that of post Soviet Russia The American superpower s enormous advantage in the correlation of power over the politically divided, economically depressed, and geopolitically isolated Russia not to mention the extraordinary power gap between the entire West and Russia both today, but especially in the formative period of post Cold War relations in the early to middle 1990s, left the onus for the development of sound, just relations on Washington and Brussels Instead of acting magnanimously, the Cold War victors rubbed wounded Moscow s nose in new humiliations: NATO expansion, treaty withdrawals, EU expansion, colorrevolutions, condescending and even insulting statements, and a general disdain for Russian interests and security perceptions It is interesting to mirror image the above list of Russian behaviors, rewriting it as if a Russian wrote it Each item on the list in that case is even more true, except for outright territorial acquisition: The US and the West complicates, even thwarts, Russian actions, especially along her extended periphery in Europe and Asia They have seized (geostrategic) territory in Eastern, Northeastern, and Southeastern Europe (Ukraine and Georgia) They challenge Russia s role as a regional leader and the multipolar order she is trying to build They interfere in our domestic politics and those of our neighbors and allies to exacerbate divisions and tarnish our democratic reputation There is a hint, though not a full deployment, of American Russology s tradition of referencing only Russian actions among the causes of the poisoning of US Russian and Western Russian relations Thus, America s agency is deflated, our foreign policy arsenal reduced mainly to reactions, sanctions, public shaming and congressional resolutions ù In these ways and throughout their statement, the author/signatories, like the reigning US policy elite they represent, ignore two to three decades of NATO and EU expansion at the expense of Russian national security efforts to construct her own economic and later security system (the Eurasian Economic Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and, later, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) in western and central Eurasia after being de facto excluded from the West s blocs Glaring is the absence of any acknowledgement of the Western meddling and escalation in not just strategically crucial for Russia not the US Ukraine and Georgia, but all along Russia s extended periphery ùtoo Compare the enormous scale of that decades long meddling with the US reaction to minor Russian forays into our hemisphere in Venezuela, a long way from the US border Recall the almost immediate resort to NATO expansion at a time in the early 1990s, when it was first broached, when Russia was hoping to be a partner in the democratic community and its main outpost in the Eurasian region Then there s the decades long political, economic, and propaganda interference in Russia s internal affairs an interference both in government and society that leaves Russia s troll farms paling in significance After Moscow had given up its external and much of its internal empire, democratized, and fell into economic depression in part as a result of erroneous Western economic counsel and woefully insufficient and belated assistance, it was slapped in the face with the broken promises about NATO expansion and being integrated into the Western security and economic infrastructure Moreover, the authors fail even to give the hint of an acknowledgement of: (1) Clinton s illegal NATO military actions in Yugoslavia; (2) George W Bush s expansion of NATO to Russia s borders, and wittingly or unwittingly encouraging Georgia to attack South Ossetia; and (3) Obama s degeneration of too much of American foreign policy and public diplomacy into smug virtue signaling and deployment of jihadist and Ukrainian neo fascist proxies to do American bidding in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine truly disturbing trends that mirror equally troubling domestic crimes The authors main purpose is to put forward six broad prescriptions ùfor America s Russia policy First, we must deal effectively with Russian interference in US elections and, most important, block any effort to corrupt the voting process ùand engage Russia through negotiations out of the public glare, focused on each side s capabilities to do great damage to the other side s critical infrastructure ù Absent is any call to deal effectively ùwith US interference in the domestic politics of Russia or that of its allies and neighbors towards the goal of expanding NATO and the EU at the expense of Russia s attempts to maintain a buffer from the Western invasion and interference that has been an intermittent fact of Russian life for centuries There is also no mention of the decades of financing Russian opposition parties and media, micromanaging Russian government in the early 1990s, the continued propaganda and often disinformation by US government media targeting the Russian people with American values, the more recent faked Trump dossier and evidence that the only documentation of any Russian role in the hacking of the democraticparty s servers and Clinton emails has been acknowledged by its CrowdStrike authors to be inconclusive a point that was hidden from the American public for nearly three years, until the revelations in the FBI interview of the company s official in charge of the post hack investigation, which was released last month What is Moscow to make of members of an American elite that foster or tolerate the use of unverified information and outright disinformation to the detriment not only of US Russian relations, but also to the political stability and thus national security of their own country in order to discredit Moscow and worsen US Russian and Western Russian relations? A logical proposal would have been the pursuit of including Russia in the West s security and economic infrastructures Now relegated to some time in the relatively distant future, a revamped version of such an aspiration would be the beginning of work towards discussions specifically geared to such inclusion, which is now unthinkable for both sides until a new Russian leader comes to power This latter prospect could be as much as two decades in the offing This, along with the emerging China Russia Iran axis is the bitter fruit of Western actions, especially NATO expansion s rekindling of Russia s traditional culture of authoritarianism and statism, and strategic and political cultures focused on vigilance against external and internal threats emanating from the West A sound interim step until relations can be more substantially improved would be to initiate talks on a US Russian or international moratorium on interference and then a bilateral or multinational treaty on non interference in the domestic politics of each other or all foreign states, based on the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe s Helsinki Final Act, which was so willfully violated by all foreign parties responsible for the Ukraine crisis: the US, the EU, and Russia alike Second, the signatories call for restoring normal diplomatic [relations] ùas a top priority for the White House and supported by the Congress ùThey add: In the wake of the Ukrainian crisis, key governmental contacts were severed, consulates shuttered and embassy staff drastically reduced ùOf course, restoring normal diplomatic relations is necessary because of abnormal diplomatic relations the new Cold War so to speak cemented by the Ukrainian crisis that began in late 2013 early 2014 However, cracking the nut that is the Ukraine crisis involves restraining the ultranationalist and neofascist element inside the Ukrainian state and society, which is actively preventing a resolution of the Donbass civil war the clincher and anchor of the new Cold War Thus, the US must urge Kiev to move away from the nationalist radicals, and this involves acknowledging the real history of the Maidan crisis and its causes But the authors make no mention and likely never will mention what is the Maidan regime s central myth a profoundly false one: the persistent Obama administration lie, reiterated every February for five years (thus extending into the Trump era) by our State Department regarding Maidan s genesis and especially that about the perpetrators of the 20 February 2014 Ukrainian snipers massacre on Kiev s Maidan The ruse persists, and not one of the statement s signatories many of whom are relative moderates when it comes to Russia, not hawks has publicly acknowledged that the snipers were not deployed by Putin puppet Viktor Yanukovich but rather were members of the ultranationalist and neofascist wing of the Maidan revolution itself, and deployed by some of its leaders, including the Maidan regime s first acting president and its first speaker of parliament, among others George Washingtons and Thomas Jeffersons they were not For any of the signatories to do so would be the death knell of one s career ambitions to become Secretary of State, the National Security Council Advisor for Russia, a professor of government at Harvard, or an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations This, and the fact that the Russiagate hoax and Trump impeachment drive were based on Ukrainian and US Ukraine driven disinformation, demonstrate just how difficult it will be to get the needle moving in the other direction Without the courage to challenge such forces, the signatories will be destined to fail in any attempt to re rationalize America s Russia and Eurasia policies Third, the signatories propose the West adopt the strategic posture ¶ that ¶ served us well during the Cold War: a balanced commitment to deterrence and d√©tente ¶, while maintaining our defense ùStanding alone, this would be nothing more or less than a call for a return to a Cold War relationship with Moscow: nuclear arms control, make safer and more stable the military standoff that cuts across Europe s most unstable regions, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, ùretention of the late Cold War Open Skies Treaty, and new confidence building measures ù However, they also propose and this is a potential plus to engage Russia in a serious and sustained strategic dialogue that addresses the deeper sources of mistrust and hostility and, at the same time, focuses on the large and urgent security challenges facing both countries ù This addresses my own primary critique of the Obama Clinton reset , in which I argued we must discuss the most difficult issues plaguing the relationship The reset at best addressed only the low hanging fruit in the relationship for example, cooperation in the war against jihadism and, at worst, served as a cover for more of the same old hegemonic expansion of colorrevolutionism, creeping NATO and EU enlargement, human rights bullying, and the like At this point, however, I have grave doubts any constructive dialogue is possible, given the geopolitical distance and increasingly ideological distance that needs to be overcome, and the unlikeliness that Washington would appoint sufficiently constructive interlocutors A similarly important point is the fourth proposal s call for changing current policies ùsufficiently to improve US Russian relations such that Moscow desists from its readiness to align with the least constructive aspects of China s US policy ùWhile an admirable goal, especially in its attempt to reverse the dynamic of Sino Russian alliance making in all but mutual security guarantees, it s fraught with grave difficulties, not least of which is that it comes too late China is now too powerful to be substantially distanced militarily, politically or economically by Moscow The moment when Moscow could have been won for the West has passed and is a non starter in lieu of substantial regime change in Russia NATO expansion was preferred to having Russia as a potential ally and Western power The absence of any concrete proposals for achieving this goal demonstrates just how difficult it will be to move the needle in the opposite direction The only real option is a moratorium on further NATO expansion to accompany the proposed talks on the deeper issues confronting the Western Russian relationship NATO expansion touches specifically on the signatories fifth proposal: On salient issues where US and Russian interests are in genuine conflict, such as Ukraine and Syria, the US should remain firm on principles shared with our allies and critical to a fair outcome More attention, however, should be paid to the cumulative effect that measured and phased steps forward can have on the overall relationship, and in turn the opportunity an improving relationship creates for further steps forward ù The call for incrementalism is appropriate, but the signatories reveal the conservatism of their approach by insisting that US and Russian interests are in genuine conflict ùin Ukraine and Syria ùThis means that they are unwilling to acknowledge that the American interest in NATO expansion to Ukraine is a fool s errand and stands at the center of the core of what galls Moscow and threatens Russian national interests and security It also means that they remain committed to the destabilizing fiasco that has been America s attempt at regime change in Syria and other countries not ready for democracy Sixth, they propose smart sanctions that are targeted, ùflexible, and can be eased quickly in exchange for Russian steps that advance negotiations ùregarding unspecified outstanding conflicts, ùincluding efforts to cease interference in the US electoral process ùThe signatories proposal correctly criticizes the steady accumulation of congressionally mandated sanctions as punishment for Russian actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the poisoning in Salisbury, violations of the INF [Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty] and election meddling, ùbecause it reduces any incentive Moscow might have to change course since it considers those sanctions permanent ù Unfortunately, since there is no American/Western quid pro quo offered regarding Western interference in Russian political processes, Western actions in Ukraine, and treaty withdrawals, Moscow might simply respond to the lifting of sanctions by lifting sanctions they instituted in response to the West s own In order to salvage America s Russia policy, its foreign policy and the American experience itself, some US foreign policy, some mea culpa at least one internally recognized is necessary I am not talking about repentance for slavery, Jim Crow, or apartheid that has been an American practice for a century and 60 years, respectively but rather an internal discourse that at least allows open discussion, if not a conclusive recognition of the anti constitutional and illegal actions undertaken by recent US administrations in relation to Russia and Eurasia since the Cold War s ostensible end Some who have been inside the Washington swamp far more deeply than I ever was or wanted to be certainly possess important secrets symptomatic of the disease and must come forward to save the country, eschewing careerism for country and truth Like the alcoholic or drug addict, the ill must acknowledge their disease in order to begin to cure it America must begin this now before it is too late To be sure, Russia is a problem She overreacts to slights and is not as democratic or republican as we had dreamed, but Russia is their dream to fulfill, not ours Russians, Ukrainians, and others living under authoritarian inclined regimes will most smoothly and quickly attain democracy and markets when they do so on their own, without outside interference, using the knowledge of how to do this extant in the West, Japan, India, and elsewhere America s responsibility is to establish good relations with Moscow to an extent possible and that does not render Moscow a threat to others or an enabler of our post Cold War sicknesses of arrogance and ambition Russia should act in a similar fashion towards the US Unfortunately, America s post Soviet Russia policy has been precisely what was needed to achieve the contrary to a secure, democratic, and free market Russia Now US politics and culture are headed in an authoritarian and unpredictable direction, upping the anxiety regarding Washington felt in Moscow, Beijing, and elsewhere The first Cold War directly and indirectly corrupted our political culture in many disparate ways The new Cold War will drive the country to a bitter end The signatories have at least performed overall a service to the country by perhaps reopening the gates to freedom of speech in America

What Nuland really wants is to get around the Russian government and win the hearts and minds of the people, using the academia, civilsociety ùactivists and students She even proposes visa free travel for Russians between the ages of 16 and 22, allowing them to form their own opinions before their life paths are set ù Because the kind of graduates that come from US college campuses these days are really an example for the whole world to aspire to! Nuland was a Sovietologist, so it s not a surprise her proposals are still stuck in the Cold War mindset But the 1980s propaganda was based on American opulence, prosperity and Reagan era confidence Soviets who bought into it ended up with what Nuland herself recognizes as the years of chaos and impoverishment during the 1990s ùPutin is the product of that disillusionment, and while one may argue things might have been better this way or that, there is zero argument that his rule hasn t been vastly preferable over the 1990s to everyone † except the oligarchs and the activists on the payroll of the National Endowment for Democracy What does the US offer now, though?

"19 Dec, 2019","Ukraine, China & 2024 retirement plans: Key takeaways from Putin's 15th annual press chat","At his annual year end press conference, Vladimir Putin addressed his presumed retirement in 2024, the situation in Ukraine, domestic issues around healthcare and demographics, and relations with China, among many other topics ByBryan MacDonald, †an Irish journalist based in Russia Thursday s Moscow event was the 15th in as many years of Putin s presidency, and finished up as one of the longest The Russian president sat for four hours and 18 minutes, taking around 80 questions from 57 journalists, of which he answered about 77 Some 1,895 reporters representing Russian and foreign media received accreditation for the conference, with many more watching online The climate crisis was the first topic Putin appeared to cast doubt upon the Western mainstream scientific consensus that humans are responsible for the transformation, but he acknowledged the problem exists No one knows the reasons for global climate change, ùhe remarked It s hard, if it s even possible, to estimate human impact but it doesn t mean that we should sit around & do nothing ù Only last week, the president held his first meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris At the press conference, Putin said he was alarmed ù by Zelensky s post meeting statements about reviewing the Minsk accords, but says he is open to another summit (which Russian media speculates will happen in April) We have nothing except the Minsk agreement If we revisit this we are at a dead end The deal, crafted in the Belarusian capital in 2015, requires Kiev to alter its Constitution and grant special status ù to the mainly Russian speaking Donbass region Although his predecessor Petro Poroshenko (now Ukraine s de facto opposition leader) signed up to the plan, it s implementation is considered impossible for Zelensky Even if he somehow got it through Parliament, he lacks the strength to face down extreme nationalists who would surely take to the streets in protest If this happened a third Maidan ù is possible, potentially leaving Ukraine in complete anarchy and threatening the business interests of Ukrainian oligarchs, including Zelensky s own sponsor, the billionaire Igor Kolomoysky Also on the subject of Ukraine, Putin stated that Russia wants to negotiate a new gas transit arrangement with its neighbor (despite the NordStream 2 direct pipeline to Germany soon coming online) Putin said he would like to ensure Ukrainian consumers get reasonably priced gas & that supplies to Europe are guaranteed Next year, the president will approach the midway point of his final term in the Kremlin As a result, speculation about the 2024 transition of power is growing Putin says he wants to remove the word consecutive ù from the Russian Constitution s rules on presidential term limits So, basically, any president can serve two periods (like the US) before being blocked from standing again The US introduced these restrictions after experiencing its own four time president, Franklin D Roosevelt Interestingly, Putin has repeatedly invited comparisons between himself and the erstwhile US leader, going all the way back to the mid 2000s Indeed, many in Russia argue that the president rescued his country from the chaotic, anarchic, and destitute 1990s in a similar fashion to how Roosevelt dragged America out of the Great Depression Such a change would presumably mean Putin will have to retire in 2024 And Russian journalists, and analysts, have interpreted it this way However, some US/UK media reporters, on the Russia beat, believe it may be a cunning way ùof resetting the rules so Putin can have another term, or terms, before the new limits apply Although sources in Moscow ridiculed this theory on Thursday night Putin also floated the possibility of Russia switching to a more parliamentary style of government which would give the prime minister (currently Dmitry Medvedev) more control, ending the hyper presidential ùsystem introduced by Boris Yeltsin in 1993 (with US support) A move like this would mean future leaders won t have Putin s sort of power, as the presidency would be downgraded He also referenced Russia s demographic problems (the population fell this year after a decade of small rises), noting how the number of potential young mothers, aged 21 29, has fallen by four million This is the effect of the 1990s economic carnage which crushed birth rates, as many people worried about basic survival Closer to home, responding to calls for Vladimir Lenin to be taken out of his Red Square mausoleum and buried, Putin (who has always made it clear he s not a fan of the Bolshevik revolutionary) wasn t very keen He insisted there s no need to touch him ù whilst people are still alive who remember the USSR in a positive fashion and continue to celebrate Soviet achievements within their lifetimes Regarding journalist Ivan Golunov, whose June arrest on spurious drug charges caused outrage in Russia, Putin pointed out that five police have been fired, with criminal cases opened against them He rejected the idea of cleansing ù police ranks, likening such a notion to the 1937 Stalinist purges A reporter from BBC Russia asked Putin to comment on his daughters, following media reports on their alleged business and work interests Putin, who generally avoids discussing his family publicly, didn t answer the question Putin commented on the impeachment of US President Donald Trump I m not so sure he ll be leaving (office), ù he quipped, blaming Democrat skulduggery and lingering resentment over Hillary Clinton s 2016 defeat They accused him of plotting with Russia, and when that turned out not to be

"21 Sep, 2019","What the uncanceling of Pepe the Frog ‚Äì just for HK protests, though ‚Äì tells us about US media","Having written hundreds of articles demonizing the amphibian meme as inherently sinister, news outlets have had to perform a quick 180 now that he has been adopted as the mascot of the Hong Kong protest movement Pepe the Frog has been everywhere during the past six months of anti government demonstrations in the Chinese city as a flash graffiti drawn on and washed off walls, a doll holding placards with political slogans and calling for political changes from custom made t shirts, in user made pictures and cartoons circulated on social media and in organizers WhatsApp and Telegram groups The latest pepe stickers#freehk#pepehkpic twitter com/iQliNqJikI For the Western media slavishly dedicated to covering the demonstrations from the protesters perspective, this has been awkward, yet impossible to ignore Is this not the same Pepe whose alternately self satisfied and downbeat visage was used as a vehicle for alt right talking points prior to the 2016 election? The one that candidate Hillary Clinton dedicated a special warning to on her website, saying he had been almost entirely co opted by white supremacists ù? The one that the Anti Defamation League still considers a hate symbol even in its unaltered form? The simplest route has been to wave this away as a coincidence, with almost every mainstream media article at pains to emphasize that the Hong Kong protesters are not alt right, and were entirely unaware of the connotations of the cartoon frog, which do not apply outside the US More sophisticated explanations have celebrated reclaiming ùPepe, recalling that he had begun his life as a stoner joke for a minutiae obsessed apolitical web cartoon by artist Matt Furie back in 2005, three years before alt right ùwas even a word All that might be correct if not for the glaring similarities between how Pepe was used three years ago and now that make it hard to believe that the current green frog had no lineage In both cases the cartoon gave a chance for protest movements to challenge the establishment through his sly subversion Is Pepe trolling you or is he being serious? When he cries is that just a cheap joke, or a comment about grave imbalances of power? Using him as a truth sayer figure couched in levels of irony, disarms, gives plausible deniability, and most of all, reflects the young, media savvy culture that permeates both the Hong Kong movement squaring up to the might of Beijing, and the 4Chan provocateurs who helped Donald Trump get elected against the prevailing cultural winds After all the slogan of the Hong Kong crowds is a Bruce Lee quote: be water ù Once again, it plays up the amorphousness and flexibility, the anonymity and persistence of the crowd, whether mass posting online or occupying a public space, trying to shake up the monolithic structures of the ruling elite Yet the difference in the coverage, depending on the narrative, is stunning A satirical cartoon can become the new swastika, and the new swastika can become a symbol of freedom, all without changing These biases can be seen through the contrasting coverage of say the Yellow Vests and Black Lives Matters or the Maidan protests, but here is a rare test case Certainly, the protesters in Hong Kong aren t drawing up Hitler mustaches on their Pepes, or making them gloat outside of gas chambers But frankly, neither did most of the images that circulated through the image boards and continue to crop up in Twitter discussions today The vilification was largely intellectually dishonest, and relied on picking unrepresentative examples to marginalize what is already a †minority hidden on the outskirts of polite internet discourse It was also ineffective Just as Pepe did not die, but returned through ever more postmodernist reincarnations, including the anarchic and popular Clown Pepe who comments on the absurdities of political correctness or the latest big tech censorship, and now again, half a world away There is a lesson here: you can call Pepe far right, and equate the OK gesture to Heil Hitler! ù But if any dissenters remain, and you are suppressing their ideas, not debating them, the internet will find a way And for all your billions, armies, and news channels you will be the ones forced to spend your time mass deleting pictures of memes off the internet to keep your grasp on power By Igor Ogorodnev, senior writer at RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/469318-pepe-frog-hong-king-media/
"5 Dec, 2018",New Cold War is more dangerous than the one the world survived ‚Äì Stephen Cohen," War With Russia? , like the biography of a living person, is a book without an end The title is a warning akin to what the late Gore Vidal termed a journalistic alert system ù not a prediction Hence the question mark I cannot foresee the future The book s overarching theme is informed by past and current facts, not by any political agenda, ideological commitment, or magical prescience The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk Hegel To restate that theme: The new US Russian Cold War is more dangerous than was its 40 year predecessor that the world survived The chances are even greater that this one could result, inadvertently or intentionally, in actual war between the two nuclear superpowers Herein lies another ominous indication During the preceding Cold War, the possibility of nuclear catastrophe was in the forefront of American mainstream political and media discussion, and of policy making During the new one, it rarely seems to be even a concern In the latter months of 2018, the facts and the mounting crises they document grow worse, especially in the US political media establishment, where, as I have argued, the new Cold War originated and has been repeatedly escalated Consider a few examples, some of them not unlike political and media developments during the run up to the US war in Iraq or, historians have told us, how the great powers sleepwalked ù into World War I: Russiagate s core allegations îUS Russian collusion, treason îall remain unproven Yet they have become a central part of the new Cold War If nothing else, they severely constrain President Donald Trump s capacity to conduct crisis negotiations with Moscow while they further vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin for having, it is widely asserted, personally ordered an attack on America ù during the 2016 presidential campaign Some Hollywood liberals had earlier omitted the question mark, declaring, We are at war ù In October 2018, the would be titular head of the democraticparty, Hillary Clinton, added her voice to this reckless allegation,flatly statingthat the United States was attacked by a foreign power ù and equating it with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks ù Clinton may have been prompted by another outburst of malpractice byThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post On September 20 and 23, respectively, those exceptionally influential papers devoted thousands of words, illustrated with sinister prosecutorial graphics, to special retellings of the Russiagate narrative they had assiduously promoted for nearly two years, along with the narrative s serial fallacies, selective and questionable history, and factual errors Again, for example, the now infamous Paul Manafort, who was Trump s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, was said to have been pro Kremlin ù during his time as a lobbyist for Ukraine under then President Viktor Yanukovych, when in fact he was pro European Union Again, Trump s disgraced national security adviser, Gen Michael Flynn, was accused of troubling ùcontacts when he did nothing wrong or unprecedented in having conversations with a Kremlin representative on behalf of President elect Trump Again, the two papers criminalized the idea, as the Times put it, that the UnitedStates and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest, ù once the premise of d√©tente And again, the Times, while assuring readers that its Special Report ù is what we now know with certainty, ù buried a related acknowledgment deep in its some 10,000 words: No public evidence has emerged showing that [Trump s] campaign conspired with Russia ù (The white collar criminal indictments and guilty pleas cited were so unrelated that they added up to Russiagate without Russia ) Astonishingly, neither paper gave any credence to anemphatic statementby the Post s own Bob Woodward înormally considered the most authoritative chronicler of Washington s political secrets îthat, after two years of research, he had found no evidence of collusion betweenTrump and Russia Nor were the Times, the Post, and other print media alone in these practices, which continued to slur dissenting opinions CNN s leading purveyor of Russiagate allegationstweetedthat an American third party presidential candidate had been repeating Russian talking points on its interference in the 2016 election and on US foreign policy ù Another prominent CNN figure was, so to speak, more geopolitical,warning, Only a fool takes Vladimir Putin at his word in Syria, ù thereby ruling out US Russian cooperation in that war torn country Much the same continued almost nightly on MSNBC For most mainstream media outlets, Russiagate had become, it seemed, a kind of cult journalism that no counterevidence or analysis could dent and thus itself increasingly a major contributing factor to the new Cold War Still more, what began two years earlier as complaints about Russian meddling ù in the US presidential election became by October 2018, forThe New Yorkerand other publications, an accusation that the Kremlin had actually put Donald Trump in the White House For this seditious charge, there was also no convincing evidence înor any precedent in American history At a higher level, by fall 2018, current and former US officials were making nearly unprecedented threats against Moscow The ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison,threatenedto take out ù any Russian missiles she thought violated a 1987 treaty, a step that would certainly risk nuclear war The secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke,threateneda naval blockade ù of Russia In yet another Russophobic outburst, the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley,declaredthat lying, cheating and rogue behavior ù are a norm of Russianculture ù These may have been outlandish statements by untutored political appointees, but they again inescapably raised the question: Who was making Russia policy in Washington † President Trump, with his avowed policy of cooperation, ù or someone else? But how to explain, other than as unbridled extremism, thecommentsby Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, himself a longtime professor of Russian politics and favored mainstream commentator? According to McFaul, Russia had become a rogue state, ù its policies criminal actions ù and the world s greatest threat ù It had to be countered by preemptive sanctions that would go into effect automatically ù î every day, ù if deemed necessary Considering the possibility of crushing ù sanctions proposedrecentlyby a bipartisan group of US senators, this would be nothing less than a declaration of permanent war against Russia: economic war, but war nonetheless Meanwhile, other new Cold War fronts were becoming more fraught with hot war, none more so than Syria On September 17, Syrian missiles accidentally shot down an allied Russian surveillance aircraft, killing all 15 crew members The cause was combat subterfuge by Israeli warplanes in the area The reaction in Moscow was indicative and potentially ominous At first, Putin, who had developed good relations with Israel s political leadership, said the incident was an accident caused by the fog of war His own Defense Ministry, however, loudly protested that Israel was responsible Putin quickly retreated to a more hard line position, and in the end vowed to send to Syria Russia s highly effective S 300 surface to air defense system, a prize long sought by both Syria and Iran Clearly, Putin was not the ever aggressive Kremlin autocrat ù unrelentingly portrayed by US mainstream media A moderate in the Russian context, he again made a major decision by balancing conflicting groups and interests In this instance, he accommodated long standing hard liners in his own security establishment The result is yet another Cold War trip wire With the S 300s installed in Syria, Putin could in effect impose a no fly zone ù over large areas of the country, which has been ravaged by war due, in no small part, to the presence of several foreign powers (Russia and Iran are there legally; the United States and Israel are not ) If so, this means a new red line ù that Washington and its ally Israel will have to decide whether or not to cross Considering the mania in Washington and in the mainstream media, it is hard to be confident that restraint will prevail In keeping with his Russia policy, President Trump may reasonably be inclined to join Moscow s peace process, though it is unlikely the mostly Democrat inspired Russiagate party would permit him to do so Now another Cold War front has also become morefraught, the US Russian proxy war in Ukraine having acquired a new dimension In addition to the civil war in Donbass, Moscow and Kiev have been challenging each other s ships in the Sea of Azov, near the newly built bridge connecting Russia with Crimea On November 25, this erupted into a small but potentially explosive military conflict at sea Trump is being pressured to help Kiev escalate the maritime war yet another potential trip wire Here, too, the president should instead put his administration s weight behind the long stalled Minsk peace accords But that approach also seems to be ruled out by Russiagate, which by October 6 included yet another Times columnist, Frank Bruni,brandingall such initiatives by Trump as pimping for Putin ù After five years of extremism, as demonstrated by these recent examples of risking war with Russia, there remained, for the first time in decades of Cold War history, no countervailing forces in Washington † no pro d√©tente wing of the Democratic or Republican Party, no influential anti Cold War opposition anywhere, no real public debate There was only Trump, with all the loathing he inspired, and even he had not reminded the nation or his own party that the presidents who initiated major episodes of d√©tente in the 20th century were also Republicans † Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan This too seemed to be an inadmissible alternative fact ù And so the eternal question, not only for Russians: What is to be done? There is a ray of light, though scarcely more In August 2018,Gallupasked Americans what kind of policy toward Russia they favored Even amid the torrent of vilifying Russiagate allegations and Russophobia, 58 percent wanted to improve relations with Russia, ù as opposed to 36 percent who preferred strong diplomatic and economic steps against Russia ù This reminds us that the new Cold War, from NATO s eastward expansion and the 2014 Ukrainian crisis to Russiagate, has been an elite project Why US elites, after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, ultimately chose Cold War rather than partnership with Russia is a question beyond my purpose here As for the special role of US intelligence elites † what I have termed Intelgate ù efforts are still underway to disclose it fully, and are still being thwarted A full explanation of the post Soviet Cold War choice would include the US political media establishment s needs † ideological, foreign policy, and budgetary, among others † for an enemy ù Or, with the Cold War having prevailed for more than half of US Russian relations during the century since 1917, maybe it was habitual Substantial meddling ù in the 2016 US election by Ukraine and Israel, to illustrate the point, did not become a political scandal In any event, once this approach to post Soviet Russia began, promoting it was not hard The legendary humorist Will Rogers quipped in the 1930s, Russia is a country that no matter what you say about it, it s true ù Back then, before the 40 year Cold War and nuclear weapons, the quip was funny, but no longer Whatever the full explanation, many of the consequences I have analyzed in War With Russia? continue to unfold, not a few unintended and unfavorable to America s real national interests Russia s turn away from the West, its pivot to China, ù is now widely acknowledged and embraced by leading Moscow policy thinkers Even European allies occasionally stand with Moscow against Washington The US backed Kiev government still covers up who was really behind the 2014 Maidan snipers massacre ù that brought it to power Mindless US sanctions have helped Putin to repatriate oligarchic assets abroad, at least $90 billion already in 2018 The mainstream media persist in distorting Putin s foreign policies into something that even the Soviet Unionnever dared to try ù And when an anonymous White House insiderexposedin theTimesthe amorality ù of President Trump, the only actual policy he or she singled out was on Russia I have focused enough on the demonizing of Putin † the Post even managed to characterize popular support for his substantial contribution to improving life in Moscow as a deal with the devil ù † but it is important to note that this derangement is far from worldwide Even aPostcorrespondentconcededthat the Putin brand has captivated anti establishment and anti American politicians all over the world ù A British journalistconfirmedthat, as a result, many countries in the world now look for a reinsurance policy with Russia ùAnd an American journalist living in Moscowreportedthat the ceaseless demonization of Putin personally has in fact sanctified him, turned him into the Patron Saint of Russia ù Again, in light of all this, what can be done? Sentimentally, and with some historical precedents, we of democratic beliefs traditionally look to the people, ù to voters, to bring about change But foreign policy has long been the special prerogative of elites In order to change Cold War policy fundamentally, leaders are needed When the times beckon, they may emerge out of established, even deeply conservative, elites, as did unexpectedly the now pro d√©tente Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid 1980s But given the looming danger of war with Russia, is there time? Is any leader visible on the American political landscape who will say to his or her elites and party, as Gorbachev did, If not now, when? If not us, who? ù We also know that such leaders, though embedded in and insulated by their elites, hear and read other, nonconformist voices, other thinking The once venerated American journalist Walter Lippmann observed, Where all think alike, no one thinks very much ù This book is my modest attempt to inspire more thinking Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor of †The Nation This article was originally published †byThe Nationand is adapted from the concluding section of Stephen F Cohen sWar With Russia?

"6 Jun, 2018",Rambouillet ruse? Why Trump could be setting up his North Korea talks to fail,"President Trump has set the bar of success so high for his forthcoming meeting with Kim Jong un, it is difficult to see how it could possibly be met Dan Glazebrook is a freelance political writer who has written for RT, Counterpunch, Z magazine, the Morning Star, the Guardian, the New Statesman, the Independent and Middle East Eye, amongst others His first book Divide and Ruin: The West s Imperial Strategy in an Age of Crisis ù was published by Liberation Media in October 2013 It featured a collection of articles written from 2009 onwards examining the links between economic collapse, the rise of the BRICS, war on Libya and Syria and austerity He is currently researching a book on US British use of sectarian death squads against independent states and movements from Northern Ireland and Central America in the 1970s and 80s to the Middle East and Africa today Dan Glazebrook is a freelance political writer who has written for RT, Counterpunch, Z magazine, the Morning Star, the Guardian, the New Statesman, the Independent and Middle East Eye, amongst others His first book Divide and Ruin: The West s Imperial Strategy in an Age of Crisis ù was published by Liberation Media in October 2013 It featured a collection of articles written from 2009 onwards examining the links between economic collapse, the rise of the BRICS, war on Libya and Syria and austerity He is currently researching a book on US British use of sectarian death squads against independent states and movements from Northern Ireland and Central America in the 1970s and 80s to the Middle East and Africa today As the New York Timesnotedlast month, To meet his own definition of success, Mr Trump will have to persuade Mr Kim to accept complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea î something that Mr Kim has shown no willingness to accept in the past, and few believe he will accede to in the future ù Such denuclearization would involve the actual dismantlement of weapons, the removal of stockpiled uranium and plutonium bomb fuel from the country and a verification program that will be one of the most complex in history, given the vastness of North Korea s mountains ùFurthermore, Trump has suggested that the North Koreans will gain nothing in return for this one sided destruction of their defenses, until the process is all but complete; as one Trump officialtoldthe Wall Street Journal, When the president says that he will not make the mistakes of the past, that means the U S will not be making substantial concessions, such as lifting sanctions, until North Korea has substantially dismantled its nuclear programs ù In other words give up your leverage first; then we ll see What Trump appears to seek is nothing less than a completely disarmed Korea that will pave the way for the Libya solution ùhis people have openly suggested is the goal Obviously, North Korea will not go for that The whole point of their nuclear program has been to ensure that their country avoids the fate of Iraq or Libya; which is why the intelligence community is generally united in their view that it will never be given up According toRyan Hass of the Brookings Institution, virtually no North Korea analyst inside or outside of the US government expect Kim Jong un to relinquish his nuclear weapons ù, quoting former CIA analystJung Pakthat Kim views nuclear weapons as both vital to the security of his regime and his legitimacy as leader of North Korea ù Meanwhile, the New York Timescomments: ask the people who have seen past peace initiatives whether they think this one will work out any differently, and they have serious doubts that Mr Kim will give up his nuclear program for any price ù, whilst forStratfor, the complete denuclearization of North Korea is a lofty goal that will be nearly impossible to ensure ù So what is Trump doing? Surely he knows what he is proposing would be completely unacceptable to any North Korean leader, let alone Kim Jong un? But maybe this is the point What if Trump, far from wanting to reach a deal, is actually deliberately pushing a proposal which is supposed to be rejected? After all, so long as he ensures his demands are unacceptable, he can offer the moon in return: recognition, technology, aid, lifting of sanctions, hell why not? even the removal of US troops from South Korea Having such an offer rejected would allow Trump much more readily to be able to paint North Korea as the aggressor unwilling to compromise, insincere in its desire for peace, etc, etc This is, after all, a time honored tactic In February 1999, in the French town of Rambouillet, a series of meetings were convened between representatives of Kosovo s multiethnic population and the US with the ostensible aim of resolving the conflict between Kosovan separatists and the Yugoslav government For its part, the Yugoslavs had proposed a ceasefire, peace talks, the return of displaced citizens, and the establishment of a devolved assembly for the province, with a wide degree of autonomy This would clearly have gone a long way to addressing the conflict; but that very fact made it completely unacceptable to the US, desperate to justify their coming onslaught against Yugoslavia Instead, they needed a peace deal that would be rejected by the Yugoslavs, who could then be painted as the aggressors, paving the way for war To this end, the Rambouillet Peace Agreement was formulated †The document demanded complete de facto independence for Kosovo, whilst still allowing the province to influence the rest of Yugoslavia by continuing to send representatives to its federal institutions Yet, just in case even this one sided arrangement was accepted by the Yugoslavs, in chapter seven of the agreement, the US inserted acrucial clause: that NATO personnel shall enjoy with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft and equipment, free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including associated airspace and territorial waters ù, whilst at the same time being immune from all legal process, whether civil, administrative or criminal, [and] under all circumstances and at all times, immune from [all laws] governing any criminal or disciplinary offences which may be committed by Nato personnel in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ù In other words, Yugoslavia would have to not only submit to a full scale occupation by NATO, but also give the occupiers the absolute and unaccountable right to abuse the population at will Such a demand could never have been accepted by any sovereign country But that, of course, was the point: this was an agreement penned precisely to be rejected, in order to paint the Serbs as the unreasoning aggressors It worked perfectly: the agreement was duly rejected, and the planned blitzkrieg of Yugoslavia followed, with 78 days of unrelenting aerial bombardment The same ruse was repeated the following year by US President Bill Clinton At Palestinian Israeli peace talks at Camp David, he made a proposal for a final settlement of the conflict which allowed Israel to keep 80 percent of their illegal settlements along with sovereignty over a patchwork of roads linking them together and thereby cutting the West Bank into unviable bantustans with refugees permanently denied the right to return to their homes in Israel As former US president Jimmy Carter commented, There was no possibility that any Palestinian leader could accept such terms and survive but official statements from Washington and Jerusalem were successful in placing the entire onus for failure on Yasir Arafat ù Indeed, through the distortions of Western media, a narrative emerged that Israeli President Ehud Barak himself had made this so called generous offer , the spurning of which demonstrated the Palestinians hatred for peace and unwillingness to settle for anything less than driving the Jews into the sea In fact, the Israeli side themselves had never accepted Clinton s proposal, and had issued twenty pages of concerns they had with it On the last of the Clinton chaired meetings the one from which Barak s supposed offer emerged, held in Taba in 2001 Barak later said that it was plain to me that there was no chance of reaching a settlement ¶ Therefore I said there would be no negotiations and there would be no delegation and there would be no official discussions and no documentation ù Nevertheless, the official narrative, to this day, recalls that the Palestinians rejected the Israelis generous offer and therefore only have themselves to blame for their continued slaughter The EU set up Yanukovych in the same way In 2008, the EU and Ukraine agreed to negotiate what was supposed to be a trade agreement Five years in the making, the EU Association Agreement was finally unveiled in 2013 But by then, the EU had included a clause on defense cooperation with the EU, effectively turning the country into an unofficial NATO member Such a measure was guaranteed and designed to tear apart a country like Ukraine, a multiethnic polity with deep and historic ties to both Russia and Europe, whose unity rested on strict adherence to a policy of neutrality in terms of East West rivalries Furthermore, Yanokovych had an explicit democratic mandate for such neutrality, having been elected on precisely this basis The Association agreement was duly rejected, as it was presumably intended to be setting the stage for the Western backed Maidan coup and civil war which followed and continues to this day So Western governments certainly have form in crafting proposals designed to be rejected, in order to justify escalation And the US has every reason for doing so with North Korea today Trump s North Korea policy throughout last year was one of warmongering rhetoric and the ratcheting up of tensions Whilst this was to some extent successful in bullying China and others into agreeing to harsher sanctions, this consensus began to fall apart as Trump s team stepped up their war talk at the end of the year, with defense secretary Mattis warning of storm clouds gathering ùand national security advisor McMaster claiming that the odds of war were increasing every day ù This ramping up of tension did not go down well in either Korea, and rapid moves to de escalate were undertaken, with North Korean involvement in the winter Olympics a symbolic, but important, signifier of greater North South cooperation to come Then, in his New Year address, Kim Jong un began a diplomatic charm offensive with the South which gained rapid results A summit was set up between the leaders of the two Koreas, which eventually took place in April when Kim Jong un became the first North Korean leader to cross the border into the South since the Korean war The summit agreed to pursue denuclearization of the peninsula and to secure a formal Peace Treaty, with an outline peace arrangement to be reached by the end of the year This emerging detente between the two Koreas has hugely undermined Trump s warmongering In an article entitled As Two Koreas Talk Peace, Trump s Bargaining Chips Slip Away ù, Mark Landlerpointed outthat the talk of peace is likely to weaken the two levers that Mr Trump used to pressure Mr Kim ¶ A resumption of regular diplomatic exchanges between the two Koreas, analysts said, will inevitably erode the crippling economic sanctions against the North, while Mr Trump will find it hard to threaten military action against a country that is extending an olive branch ù Landler went on to quote Jeffrey A Bader, a former Asia advisor to Barack Obama, that, following the North South rapprochement, said It becomes awfully hard for Trump to return to the locked and loaded, fire and fury phase of the relationship ù Worse, Inside the White House, some worry that Mr Kim will use promises of peace to peel South Korea away from the United States and blunt efforts to force him to give up his nuclear weapons ù Trump, therefore, urgently needs to snuff out this rapprochement if he is to return to the bellicosity that marked his Korea policy hitherto As Landler wrote, Mr Kim made a bold bet on diplomacy ù and Trump needs to ensure that it fails The best way of doing so is by putting himself at the head of it If Trump is indeed planning to use the Rambouillet ruse to reignite tensions against the North, it is important that he spin his designed to be rejected offer as somehow incredibly generous And in recent weeks there have indeed been moves in that direction First of all, Trump has appeared to accept that denuclearization might not need to happen in one fell swoop, telling reporters that whilst It would certainly be better if it were all in one ¶ I don t think I want to totally commit myself ùNext, Trump went out of his way to guarantee Mr Kim s safety He will be safe He will be happy His country will be rich, ùthe president said You can already imagine Trump s words when his generous offer gets rejected: we offered him security We offered him prosperity We offered him phased elimination And he rejected all of it ù Fascinatingly, it turns out that Trump s national security advisor John Bolton has actually already suggested precisely the Rambouillet ruse According to theNew York Times, Two weeks before he was recruited as national security adviser, [Bolton] said a meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim was useful only because it would inevitably fail, and then the United States could move swiftly on to the next phase î presumably a military confrontation ¶ It could be a long and unproductive meeting, or it could be a short and unproductive meeting, he said on Fox News Even among officials who worry about war, there is sympathy for his view that failing quickly ùwould be valuable Meanwhile,Stratfor s analysis of the likely prospects for the forthcoming summit concluded that it may also reinforce the idea that if the two leaders can t negotiate a way out of the conflict, then perhaps a diplomatic solution isn t possible and talk of a military solution to the United States North Korea problem could return Without some change, we ll probably find ourselves back on the path to containment, if not on a course toward military action to end the North Korean nuclear and missile program once and for all ù Whether military action is realistically possible against North Korea, however, remains a serious question Most analysts agree that the fallout from any retaliation both against the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea, and against US allies in Seoul and Kyoto would be unacceptably high James Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, is typical in hisviewthat there are no military options which would result in fewer than several hundred thousand casualties and perhaps as many as 2m to 3m ù So if war is not on the cards, to what end would Trump seek the rejection of his offer? One answer has already been suggested to scupper the emerging North South co operation that threatens to erode US influence on the peninsula Summit failure would give Trump a perceived moral right to bully the South into ending its outreach and returning to the US position of isolating the North But another reason could lie in Trump s trade war with China, the opening shots of which have only just been fired Any supposed North Korean intransigence could provide Trump with cover for initiating secondary sanctions against North Korea s supposed allies Congressional law already allows Trump to initiate secondary sanctions against anyone trading with the victim of primary sanctions, but with the current atmosphere of rapprochement, it is difficult for Trump to justify using these against China at present A North Korean walk out would provide the perfect excuse for stepping up economic warfare against China under the guise of sanctioning Korea Indeed, Trump has already been setting up China as a potential scapegoat for any failure to reach a deal, claiming that Kim s position had hardened following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping There was a different attitude by the North Korean folks after that meeting, ùTrump told reporters recently, I can t say that I m happy about it ù The entire trajectory of Trump is, after all, not one of conciliation, but of escalation on all fronts Escalation against immigrants, against the working class, against Iran, against China, and even against his supposed chums in Moscow There is absolutely no reason to think that North Korea is some kind of magical exception to this golden rule Setting up a deal guaranteed to be rejected, but which can be spun as incredibly generous, is, of course, no mean feat This is especially true given that Kim has now repeatedly stated that he is willing to give up his nuclear weapons Indeed, this possibility cannot be entirely ruled out: after all, North Korea s conventional capacity alone not to mention its mutual defense treaty with China arguably provides as much deterrence as is necessary to prevent an invasion, as those casualty figures quoted above bear out In this case, the devil will be in the detail and more specifically in the timings of the granting of concessions Trump is likely, in my view, to offer what appear to be very generous concessions, but make them contingent on unacceptably obtrusive verification measures or unachievable levels of proof before any of them kick in Perhaps they will just copy and paste chapter seven of the Rambouillet Agreement in its entirety A secret clause demanding NATO occupation of all of North Korea would probably do the trick",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428862-trump-north-korea-summit/

It s not to be found This oversight is already resonating in the Russian capital like a bad joke Yet few people are laughing, because Russia has been dragged through the hot coals for over a year, enduring a slew ofsanctions, reckless mediareports, diplomaticdisasters even NATO encroachment over empty claims of Russian meddling ùin the US presidential elections on behalf of Donald Trump The indictment against Manafort and Gates goes on to say, in connection once again to Ukraine, that [I]t is illegal to act as an agent of a foreign principal engaged in certain United States influence activities without registering the affiliation ù Well, that s interesting A very good lawyer could probably level the very same charge against US Senator John McCain and Victoria Nuland, former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, both of whom showed up in central Kiev,agitatingthe masses amid the Maidan protests That certainly seems to qualify as influence activities But I digress This is not the first time Manafort has been manhandled by the FBI, and I can t help but think call it a hunch it is due to his Trump affiliations In July, for example, Manafort and his family were rudely awakened in a pre dawn FBI raid that was a bit over the top, to say the least Even CNN, rarely sympathetic to the Trump camp, described it as an unusually hard nosed tactic in a probe that centers on possible tax and financial crimes ùFBI agents stormed into the Manafort home with guns drawn ùas the family was still asleep The FBI even insisted on searching Kathleen Manafort for weapons, the sourcestoldCNN Now compare the way Trump affiliates are being treated, on the basis of exactly nothing, to that of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Convention (DNC), which attracted enough dirt to keep the FBI busy for many decades The most publicized indiscretion was the shocking revelation that then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had conducted government business over her home computer system As the Associated Press delicatelydescribedit, the unusual practice of a Cabinet level official running her own email server would have given Clinton significant control over limiting access to her message archives The practice also would complicate the State Department s legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations, lawsuits or public records requests ù In an investigation conducted by former FBI Director James Comey, of the approximately 30,000 emails Clinton turned over in 2014, the FBI found 110 emails, in 52 email chains, have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 of those chains contained Secret information at the time; eight contained Confidential information at the time ù It is also worth noting that while Clinton was secretary of state in 2010, a US soldier, Chelsea Manning, stole 250,000 diplomatic cables and handed them over to WikiLeaks, which happily dumped them into the public realm Despite all that, not only did Comeyissuea statement exonerating Clinton for organizing her government emails through a private server, he allegedly did sobeforecompleting the investigation, according to two Republican senators This is just one of many incidences of wrongdoing on the part of Hillary Clinton and the DNC that has been categorically ignored, while Russia continues to get tarred and feathered on the basis of groundless accusations that it somehow handed the election to Trump right under the noses of the American people Never mind the fact that the US voting machines aren t even connected to the internet But no matter Trump accuses Clinton & Dems of Witch Hunt , says aim is to distract from tax cutshttps:// tdotco /XJT9mXOyjH Clearly, there appears to be two separate standards influencing the scales of justice in the United States On the one side, there is the scale that judges the behavior of Hillary Clinton, who has broken the law on more than one occasion, yet remains beyond the arm of the law and the disfavor of the media The other much more sensitive scale is being used 24/7 against the Trump administration, despite the total absence to date of any solid evidence connecting Donald Trump s victory in the 2016 presidential election to Russian meddling ù The question now is, how far will this anti Russia inquisition go, especially considering that Mueller s investigation has done nothing to prove the year long media farce of Russia collusion It is critical to put to rest this Russophobic nonsense, which is not only disastrous for US Russia relations, but to thefutureof America s two party political system, which has been hanging in the balance ever since Trump entered the Oval Office @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/408251-manafort-ukraine-russiagate-dead/
"5 Oct, 2017","$100k ‚ÄòRussian‚Äô Facebook ads are a drop in the bucket, pretext to discredit Trump ‚Äì senator","The potential impact of the so called Russia linked Facebook ads recently turned over to Senate Intelligence Committee, is vastly exaggerated, Virginia Senator Richard Black (R) told RT, adding that the only goal of the ever expanding probe is to defame US President Trump On Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee briefed the public on the ongoing investigation into the alleged Russian meddling in the US election † Senator Mark Warner (D VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, advocated new restrictions on online ads According to a proposed bill, the ads purchased by foreign entities, ùsuch as Russia, would be labeled as such to protect ù Americans from outside interference If you see an ad on a social media site, Americans should know whether the source of that ad was a foreign entity, ùWarner said Black believes that the whole issue with Russia linked Facebook ads is blown out of proportion, arguing that the amount purchased could not influence the campaign in any case When they are talking about social ads, they are talking about a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads that is a drop in a bucket, I mean that s like throwing a small pebble into the Atlantic Ocean You re not going to affect anything with a hundred thousand dollars in ads, ùBlack told RT The Senate Intelligence Committee s own acknowledgement that the ads were not directly promoting either of the candidates, but sort of aimed at various people ùdid not give the accusations against Russia any credibility, he pointed out The mere fact that the ads were paid for in Russian rubles cannot serve as compelling evidence of Moscow s involvement, as they could be just as well purchased by Americans living in Russia, for instance There are plenty of American citizens who are residents of Russia right now who may have just sat down and said: You know I m going to push something out, I m going to buy Facebook ads and I m going to spend a few thousand dollars to do it I m going to go after Clinton or I m going to go after Trump So, the fact that there happen to be ads purchased in rubles tells me absolutely nothing, ùBlack said The fact that nine months into the probe the committee has not come to any definite conclusions and has so far to present any findings, points to the lack of any evidence of collusion between Moscow and the current US administration, Black said, calling the speech by Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr and Senator Mark Warner the most vacuous interview I have ever heard ù They have not found any evidence of President Trump or his administration colluding and so they felt the need to sort of come up with something that is anti Russian, ùBlack said, adding that he believes that the committee is designed with an express purpose of undermining the President ù The whole plan is farcical, ùhe added After Facebook turned over some 3,400 ads the social media giant said are linked to some fake pages affiliated with one another ùand likely operated out of Russia, ùthe focus of the Senate probe shifted to the role of social media The ads were purchased in the period from June 2015 to May 2017 and, according to Facebook s analysis did not endorse either of the candidates but were aimed at amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum ù This week, Facebook reported that the majority of the ads, 56 percent, were displayed after the election Some 10 million American voters are estimated to have been exposed to the ads The perceived impact of the Russia linked Facebook ads cannot stand any comparison with the millions of dollars spent by lobbies and by Washington itself to interfere in other countries affairs, former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard told RT Compared to the millions upon millions of dollars if not tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that s spent by AIPAC [The American Israel Public Affairs Committee], or that was spent by Open Society Foundation in Ukraine in the overthrow and the corruption and chaos in Maidan, ùthe alleged $100,000 worth of ads are absolutely a joke, ùRickard said If there can be talk about collusion that might undermine the integrity of the US election, it should be about the apparent collusion between Google, Facebook and the democraticparty, he argued, labelling the search engine and the social media giant absolutely left wing organizations ù Google started New America Foundation, it is a think tank in Washington, DC, that has tremendous influence on the left wing side of the intelligence community, ùhe said, arguing that both companies are owned by the Democrats lock, stock and barrel ù Rickard went on to note he believes that the Senate Intelligence Committee s probe will bear no fruit, as it is only needed to push an agenda that is incredibly anti Russia ù It s going to be dragged out and in the end what we ll find is that yes, some ads were purchased, and, yes, some means were hacked, but certainly no impact on American election, ùhe said

"14 Jul, 2017","Trump-Russia dominates headlines, but there‚Äôs more evidence of collusion between Democrats & Ukraine","Ukrainian cooperation with the democraticparty appears to have been far deeper than any equivalent Trump Russia collusion Both pale in comparison to Washington s meddling in the former USSR But the US media focuses on the most illusory of the situations Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail

Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv It s pretty obvious Donald Trump Jr isn t the brightest light in the firmament The lethargic, spoiled and languid persona he projects doesn t help either Nevertheless, the current hysteria surrounding his meeting a small time Russian lawyer is beyond any bounds of reason Especially coming from journalists who have surely met a dodgy source or two in their time, in the hope of a scoop Natalia Veselnitskaya was almost certainly not representing the Kremlin when she courted baby Trump Rather she waslobbyingon behalf of a client, mixed up in the Sergei Magnitsky case To that end, the ex UK tabloid hack Robert Goldstoneexaggeratedher usefulness to attract Donald Jr s attention By Trump s own account, he quickly sussed this distorted pretext and pulled back Plus, it s worth mentioning how she s also engaged plenty ofDemocratsas part of her campaign Nevertheless, certain media elements have been guilty of greater inflation than Veselnitskaya Including theNew York Times, which laughably labeled her a fearsome Moscow insider, ùwithout explaining how it was Moscow Oblast, not Moscow city, where she enjoyed this clout Because despite the shared name, the region and the metropolis are two different entities, roughly analogous to the relationship between Virginia and Washington DC Thus, the Times misleading headline was much the same as a Russian outlet hailing a Richmond based attorney as some kind of White House specialist There is another thing which makes this endless Trump Russia delirium even more dubious And that s how the US establishment will leap on any connection, no matter how vague, concerning the President s team and Russians, but ignores dealings between the democraticparty and Ukraine The elephant in the room which has been almost completely ignored, and was amazingly not even mentioned when Petro Poroshenko visited Washington last month Let s be clear, Ukraine feared a Trump presidency Because, on the campaign trail, the candidate had openly suggestedrecognizingRussia s reabsorption of Crimea and spoke of the Donbass crisis as a problem for Europe, not America As a result, Kiev bet the house on Hillary Clinton And lost As Politicoreportedin January: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election And they helped Clinton s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers ù Now, this is pretty explosive stuff A credible American news organization is reporting how a foreign government directly interfered in the US election But the popular press didn t pursue the story Presumably, because its runs counter to the established narrative A Ukrainian American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort, and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation, ùthe piece continued The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia ù And here was the zinger: Politico s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections ù Later, Politicofocusedon the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American activist, who admitted acting as a link between Ukraine s Washington Embassy and the Democratic National Committee And also how Sergei Leshchenko, elected in 2014 as an MP for Poroshenko s party, had offered ledgers purportedly showing connections between Trump and Manafort before urging Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort ùIncidentally, Manafort has always been especially appalled at attempts to link his work to Russia, saying all my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West ù Leschenko wasn t coy about his intentions He openly admitted trying toexposeTrump as a pro Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world, ùby preferring Moscow to Ukraine Furthermore, as The Atlantic noted: the investigation into the payments listed in the ledger îwhich in April were partially corroborated by theAPthrough wire transfers that Manafort claimed were legitimate îmysteriously faded after the U S election, raising questions about whether Ukrainian officials aired concerns about Manafort less to root out corruption than to undermine the Trump campaign ù Overall, Democrat Ukraine collusion seems far deeper than anything so far proven between the Trump campaign and Russia For instance, Donald Jr stands exposed as having been willing to meet someone described as affiliated with the Kremlin to get information on Hillary, which was pretty dumb The meeting itself appeared to be a bait and switch so the lawyer could lobby on other matters However, the Ukraine story involved a concerted and deliberate campaign, including cooperation between Kiev representatives and the Clinton camp to research Trump Kremlin connections Thus, If the issue is collusion, it s obvious there was much greater connivance concerning Ukraine and the Democrats than a single exchange involving Donald Jr and an insignificant lawyer One where no information was actually provided That said, American outrage over meddling from Kiev and Moscow is laughable in the context of Washington s long history of interference in both countries politics In 1996, the US openly intervened in Russia s election to help Boris Yeltsin defeat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov And in 2011, Washington officials, including Clinton, publicly supported a protest campaign over disputed parliamentary elections The following year,Michael McFaularrived as ambassador to Moscow and unabashedly courted fringe opposition leaders in his very first event in the role In Ukraine, the interruptions have had even more serious consequences By the admission of Victoria Nuland, a member of the Obama administration, Washington spent over$5 billionon influence projects in the country The first regime change ùoperation came in 2004 and was known as the orangerevolution ùAnd in 2013, US politicians and officials, such as John McCain and Nuland herself, turned up in Kiev to encourage the Maidan movement, in which the USambassadorGeoffrey Pyatt was prominent That led to the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government, which divided the country and caused the separation of Crimea and a civil war in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions And it also contributed to an economic collapse which has seen the average Ukrainian salary fall to around $200 a month and led to unprecedented levels of emigration For sure, Ukrainians didn t hide their hostility toTrump Interior Minister Arsen Avakov deriding the eventual winner as a dangerous marginal ùanddescribinghim as a clown ùon Twitter Many Russians publicly slammed Clinton, which was hardly surprising after shecomparedVladimir Putin to Hitler The fact remains there is no evidence of a direct Kremlin campaign to undermine America s election The media has almost totally ignored Kiev s transparent meddling to chase Russian ghosts All the while downplaying US manipulation of the political process throughout the former Soviet

As we have just seen in America, they don t seem to need to provide evidence for their findings to become accepted gospel truth these days In fact, this entire article is precisely based on the assumption of how the DNC hacks, many analysts believe, were just a skirmish in a larger war against Western institutions and alliances ù(to quote the intro) As we all know, there is no actual proof of Kremlin involvement in the DNC hacks Indeed, WikiLeaks itself hassaidthe Russian government was not its source And its envoyclaimedthat a disgusted ùwhistleblower was responsible NEW YORKER:In early January, two weeks before the Inauguration, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, released a declassified report concluding that Putin had ordered an influence campaign to harm Clinton s election prospects, fortify Donald Trump s, and undermine public faith in the US democratic process ù The declassified report provides more assertion than evidence Intelligence officers say that this was necessary to protect their information gathering methods Critics of the report had repeatedly noted that intelligence agencies, in the months before the Iraq War, endorsed faulty assessments concerning weapons of mass destruction But the intelligence community was deeply divided over the actual extent of Iraq s weapons development; the question of Russia s responsibility for cyberattacks in the 2016 election has produced no such tumult Seventeen federal intelligence agencies have agreed that Russia was responsible for the hacking REALITY:This is not entirely true As many others have pointed out, the NSA (i e , the agency most likely to know, because it can monitor communications) hasofferedonly moderate support NEW YORKER:Another Administration official said that, during the transfer of power, classified intelligence had shown multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russian representatives, but nothing that rose to the level of aiding or coordinating the interference with the election REALITY:Obama s team had much the same level of contacts In fact, his chief Russia hand, ùMcFaul, even visited Moscow during the 2008 transition to speak to Russian officials Was in October 2008, but yes, I did meet with Russian officials then (as I always had when visiting Moscow for previous 25 years)https:// tdotco /M4W1xUowvv And there was nothing wrong in what McFaul did For example, Bill Clinton spoint manon Russia and Eastern Europe was considered a source of intelligence information and classified as""a special unofficial contact""by SVR The man concerned, Strobe Talbot, correctlypointedout how it was an exaggeration of chats he had with the Russian ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov Additionally, Henry Kissinger has maintained intensive contacts with Moscow for decades Yet every recent American president has sought his advice And George W Bush s Russia expert, Elizabeth Jones, actuallygrew upin Moscow and attended local Russian schools NEW YORKER:Russian security concerns were hardly the only issue at stake with respect to the expansion of NATO; Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries in the region were now sovereign and wanted protection ¶ Putin, in his first few years in office, was relatively solicitous of the West He was the first foreign leader to call George W Bush after the destruction of the World Trade Center towers When he spoke at the Bundestag, later that month, he addressed its members in German, the language that he had spoken as a KGB agent in Dresden He even entertained the notion of Russian membership in NATO America s invasion of Iraq, which Putin opposed, marked a change in his thinking REALITY:Protection from what exactly? In the 1990 s, nobody was threatening anyone and Russia was both on its knees and desperately trying to join the Western fold, under the famously pro American Boris Yeltsin Indeed, as acknowledged by the magazine, during his early years in office, Putin continued the same posture, before becoming embittered by NATO expansion and the illegal Iraq War There have been countless academic articles, from genuine experts, backing up this view And even George Kennan, the most celebrated American Russia analyst of the twentieth century,agreed Thus, NATO s overreach eastwards has caused the exact problem that NATO purportedly exists to circumvent: insecurity in Europe In this sense, it was like employing a team of golden retrievers to clean up shredded canine hair Also, is it such a big surprise that the illegal invasion of a sovereign country, based on obviously false evidence, without a UN mandate, would affect the thinking of a government which regards its UN veto as an important defense tool? NEW YORKER:He (Putin) was alarmed by the Obama Administration s embrace of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt And he was infuriated by the US led assault on Muammar Qaddafi s regime REALITY:This is presented as something irrational, and comes without proper context However, given that Russia is home to around 20 million Muslims, and has a history of problems with Islamist terrorism, what s unusual about Putin being concerned about secular, stable (if obnoxious) regimes in the Middle East being replaced by (obviously even more obnoxious) radical Islamists? Also, he was infuriated about Qaddafi, because as mentioned earlier, the mandate the UN agreed to was for a no fly zone   not a fully fledged NATO campaign of airstrikes, coordinated with the opposition POLL: Trump Administration More Trustworthy Than Media In fairness, not very hard to beat https:// tdotco /jmuciYXOPspic twitter com/vysRtei4xi NEW YORKER:Russian television, of course, covered the siege of Aleppo as an enlightened act of liberation, free of any brutality or abuses REALITY:Which is more or less exactly how American and British TV covered the liberation ù of Baghdad in 2003 Check out this extraordinaryreportfrom BBC s Andrew Marr Who later became the channel s political editor NEW YORKER:And yet Russian military planners and officials in the Kremlin regarded Georgia as a failure in the realm of international propaganda REALITY:It s not hard to see why Even to this day, US news outlets (and the aforementioned McFaul who definitely knows better) continue to insist that Russia attacked Georgia But in actual fact, the EU s independent investigation into the conflictruledthat Georgia started the war NEW YORKER:The United States, meanwhile, had its own notable cyberwar success In 2008, in tandem with Israeli intelligence, the US launched the first digital attack on another country s critical infrastructure, deploying a worm, ù known as Stuxnet, that was designed to cause centrifuges in Iran to spin out of control and thereby delay its nuclear development REALITY:This admitted act of aggression is given a sentence, but an incident in Estonia in 2007 (never proved to have been Russian state ordered) is highlighted over many paragraphs complete with quotes from the country s former President Toomas Ilves NEW YORKER:Obama s adviser Benjamin Rhodes said that Russia s aggressiveness had accelerated since the first demonstrations on Maidan Square, in Kiev When the history books are written, it will be said that a couple of weeks on the Maidan is where this went from being a Cold War style competition to a much bigger deal, ù he said Putin s unwillingness to abide by any norms began at that point It went from provocative to disrespectful of any international boundary ù REALITY:Even though they have 13,000 words to play with, our heroes never consider other aspects of Maidan Such as, was it normal for serving US and EU officials to turn up at the rallies and more or lessencourageprotestors to overthrow their democratically elected government? Indeed, it looked like the rock star style adulation went to their heads Furthermore, what authority did US official s Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt have tochoosethe subsequent regime in Kiev? NEW YORKER:Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany s foreign intelligence agency, has expressed concern that Russian hackers are also trying to disrupt the German political scene, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is standing for reelection as a stalwart supporter of NATO and the EU REALITY:German intelligence recently admitted that it foundno evidenceof Russian election hacking after insinuations of such activity was breathlessly carried by popular media last year Notably, the all clear ùgiven to Moscow was ignored by the same outlets Also, this whole premise is a bit illogical, seeing as the only realistic alternative to Merkel   the SPD led by Martin Schultz   is even more pro EU than her CDU party And Schultz himself has spent most of his adult life working in Brussels, home to both the EU and NATO NEW YORKER:While officials in the Obama Administration struggled with how to respond to the cyberattacks, it began to dawn on them that a torrent of fake news ù reports about Hillary Clinton was being generated in Russia and through social media REALITY:It s been proven the fake news ù was primarilygeneratedin America itself and inMacedonia Not Russia NEW YORKER:Russia s political hierarchy and official press greeted Trump s Inauguration with unreserved glee REALITY:Given Clinton s aggressive anti Russiarhetoric, during which she compared Putin to Adolf Hitler, why is this a surprise? Especially when Trump had spoken of trying to mend fences with Moscow? The words straw ù at ùand clutching ùcome to mind And we shall leave it there Because I ve just breached the 2,500 word barrier myself and am in danger of resembling those I reprimand Meanwhile, dear reader you may well have bitten off all your fingernails by now If you ve made it this far As for The New Yorker, their approach to covering Russia appears to be inspired by the great Samuel Beckett and his wonderful¬†observation:""Ever tried Ever failed No matter Try Again Fail again Fail better ""Perhaps they d benefit from following the philosophy of my late grandfather, Paddy, born the same year as the writer, who used to say, spade in hand,""you may as well do a job properly as do it at all ""He was right too",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/378921-trump-putin-new-yorker-cold-war/
"2 Feb, 2017","Backed into a corner, Kiev reignites the Ukraine War","The old journalistic maxim, report what you know and stick to the facts, ù has been difficult to honor during the Ukraine conflict Because while every military confrontation has a fog of war, ù this firefight has gone further Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv It has a sort of cloud of war ùAnd a big thick and grey one at that, which envelopes everyone who tries to penetrate it in all sorts of mud, grime and manure At this point, almost all observers who ve touched it have shipped a soiling or six, and that s why everyone except the poor, unfortunate locals caught up in the battlegrounds felt relieved when the matter appeared to have become frozen after the Minsk accords And a nod seemed as good as a wink for quite some time However, now the situation has changed And dramatically at that From 2014, until two weeks ago, the demarcation line was clear The Kiev regime was supported by, and propped up by, the Obama administration in Washington And the ethnic Russian rebels they fought were backed from Moscow While the former US leader undoubtedly regarded Ukraine as an unwanted headache, he deferred to powerful figures who had skin in the game Like Joe Biden, whose family has business interests there, and Victoria Nuland, an ideologue who helped foment the Maidan movement and chose the subsequent rulers in Kiev There was also bi partisan support from the likes of John McCain and other Republicans, who still adhered to Bush era principles regarding NATO expansion Not to mention the containment ùof Russia and the long standing desire to prevent any potential rapprochement between Moscow and other European states, notably Germany, which might threaten US hegemony in the region But now there s a new sheriff in town One that apparently has no time for the consensus which has dominated since 1945 Which amounts to Russia is only useful when it s weak ù Today, in Donald Trump s view, the biggest threats to American security don t emanate from the Kremlin Instead, they are Islamic terrorism and the rise of China Furthermore, the new President apparently believes that Russia can be useful in both situations That said, Moscow, which has cultivated close relations with Beijing, is surely only interested in cooperating on the former mission Adding fuel to the fire, Trump might even have a personal vendetta here After all, it was Ukrainian meddling in last year s election thatbrought downPaul Manafort, a prominent adviser And Petro Poroshenko s team made it abundantly clear they were waiting for Hillary Clinton to walk into the White House and bankroll them for the next four years When Trump defied the odds and defeated her, it was a disaster for Kiev Paul Simon once crooned: Hello Darkness, my old friend, I ve come to talk with you again ùAnd that s what the resumption of heavy duty violence in Ukraine feels like Because there is nothing to be gained from it Put simply, Russia hasn t the resources, or desire, to invade or suppress the entire country And Kiev cannot defeat the ethnic Russian rebels in the east, unless Moscow chooses to abandon them Which is highly unlikely Yet, the problem now is that the Poroshenko regime feels cornered because it has probably lost its main sponsor in Washington And bland State Departmentcommentson the renewed violence this week underscore this Devoid of haughty condemnations of Russia, they also contradict Kiev s casualty figures Additionally, Europe (outside of Sweden, Poland and the Baltics) has never had much interest in Ukraine Nobody can point to a concerted effort to support it financially and it s been understood that EU membership was never on the table for the poorest and arguably the most corrupt state on the continent Instead, EU members took their direction from Washington and halfheartedly showed limited solidarity Bestexemplifiedby Nuland s infamous F**k the EU ù comment to former US ambassador Geoff Pyatt Thus, Kiev has finally reached the stage where it pretty much has nothing left to lose And this explains the sudden escalation Poroshenko, and the uber nationalist volunteer battalions he must defer to, is trying to kick the night until it bleeds daylight And this is entirely futile Here s what we know The Ukrainian President was in Berlin for talks with Angela Merkel Sources in Berlin suggest how the Chancellor gave him a tongue lashing about corruption And that he used the, conveniently timed, resumption of hostilities as an excuse to avoid whatever lecture German officials had planned for the following day Kiev immediately went into hysteria mode, insisting that the rebels had launched some kind of assault on their forces But this makes no sense, because the ethnic Russians have nothing to gain from a new offensive And nobody believes that Moscow, exploring opportunities to build new relations with the West, would acquiesce to any form of provocation right now What appears to have occurred is that a creeping Ukrainian advance on the town of Adiivka was going relatively smoothly, until the insurgents copped it and fired back with artillery And this resulted in a heavy death toll As playing the victim has been successful for Kiev since 2014, they immediately flung blame at the rebels But it was clear they were crying wolf shortly afterwards, when the deputy defense minister, Igor Pavlovsky, did something so dimwitted that it requires an apology to dimwits As of today, despite everything, metre by metre, step by step, whenever possible, our boys have been advancing, ùhetolddomestic media And, just like that, he kiboshed Kiev s entire narrative By exposing how the regime had provoked the escalation As it happened, German media agreed Sueddeutsche Zeitung, regarded as a paper of record and establishment journal,reportedhow Berlin is seeing through Ukraine s crocodile tears Russia s chief diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, agreed Even the biased German press acknowledged that Poroshenko was behind it, ùhe snorted For its part, Moscow has been consistent on how it sees any resolution to the crisis That is the implementation of the Minsk agreements, where Kiev agreed to grant semi autonomy to the Lugansk and Donetsk regions in exchange for the territories returning to Ukrainian jurisdiction after elections are held The problem is that the regime vulnerable to radical nationalists who increasingly influence policy can t implement what they signed without risking another coup As a result, Poroshenko is fairly goosed He s probably lost his American patrons and the Europeans have grown tired of his waffle Meanwhile, he can t do a deal with Moscow because his own headbangers would lynch him At the end of the day, Kiev bet the house on Hillary And they lost ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/376039-poroshenko-kiev-reignites-war/
"29 Jan, 2017",How EU could really hurt Putin: Invite Russia to join the Euro,"Sanctions against Russia have failed to alter the Kremlin s policies and actually increased popular support for Vladimir Putin Now, there are growing calls for a change of tack Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Like a lake reliant on multiple affluents, the individual headlines eventually morph into a whole An assemblage dripping with drivel Russia is apparently attempting to infiltrate or interfere with theBaltics,Germany,France, theNetherlands,Scotland,Italy, theCzech Republic,Sweden, andFinland And all at the same time to boot Which is pretty impressive for a country that doesn t even boast the largest economy in Europe (that being Germany) This follows Moscow s alleged success in securing theUS Presidencyfor Donald Trump and convincing millions of Brits to opt forBrexit Not to mention how it seemingly orchestrated recentelectionsuccesses in Bulgaria and Moldova for its useful idiots ù Nevermind the fact that the Kremlin s soft power can t convince the majority of Ukrainians to love it, despite practically everyone understanding the Russian language there and a great many citizens boasting direct family ties to their neighbor We are expected to swallow how Russia is so incredibly influential that it dominates politics practically everywhere Like an elephantine geopolitical octopus Something even the US couldn t manage in the late 1940 s when itcontrolledaround half of global GDP And was handing out interest free loans to boot The reason this nonsense narrative has taken hold is simple The Western establishment which thought it had achieved the end of history ù twenty five years ago is getting a severe kicking And sustained by an absolute conviction that it oversees the sole legitimate belief system in the world an assumption which would survive a trek through the most Byzantine hall of mirrors it s looking for somebody else to blame Indeed, at this stage, Popes from the Middle Ages would be impressed by Eurocrats resolute belief in their infallibility Fake news vaccine idiot s suggestion that won t change what people don t like about the elites (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /ebdREyD97Xpic twitter com/py0jWPBehp Thus, these mandarins have chosen the Kremlin as their bogeyman In part, because it has been the traditional enemy of European liberals Additionally, the fact that people of a certain age i e most current leaders and opinion formers grew up fearing its Soviet incarnation makes it an easier sell And Russia has obliged them by adopting increasingly conservative domestic policies and consistently re electing Vladimir Putin, who has become the sworn enemy of the entrenched elite Largely because he reversed Boris Yeltsin s policy of bending over backwards to appease the West But most importantly, blaming Russia means our betters don t need to take any responsibility for their own shortcomings Because, why would they conduct thorough investigations into why Americans rejected Hillary Clinton or the Brits decided to divorce from Brussels when they can blame Moscow? After all, the latter path allows the avoidance of accountability READ MORE: EU expands task force aimed at combatting alleged Russian propaganda Instead, Obama sanctions Russia for hacking ù Without a shred of proof And then pundits wonder why Putin s approval ratings remain sky high, even though this country has just endured a pretty nasty recession and living standards have stalled for most, and decreased for many In other words, the perfect conditions exist for popular discontent against the government Yet, rather than weakening Putin s administration, the penalties bolstered it And the negative propaganda assault against Russia has encouraged a siege mentality here And, of course, like any proud people who feel victimized, the Russians have rallied around their leader, who is now popular even with younger people that largely disliked him when I first moved here seven years ago So, it s fair to say how Western powerbrokers unwittingly pulled off a considerable achievement Their cack handed policy towards Russia has made the government of a country experiencing serious economic difficulties more secure than it was a decade ago, when the economy was growing at around eight percent annually And it takes a profoundly misguided policy to produce this sort of result Thus, imagine you were in Brussels right now advising Donald Tusk? Or across in Berlin, at Angela Merkel s desk? The previous desire to extend NATO and EU power projection up to Russia s borders has failed, Ukraine is a bloody mess, and the two aforementioned institutions are facing existential crises Meanwhile, attempts to make Putin pay for stymying their dreams have backfired Given how these officials believe the decline of the liberal order ù is entirely the Kremlin s fault, and their own decisions have had no part to play, the only solution is to weaken Putin s position And sanctions clearly aren t working Just imagine if Russian troops were amassed on America s borders (Op Edge by@NeilClark66)https:// tdotco /LUMvfRlJrC There are a few options here Eurocrats could pump billions of euros into Ukraine, bolstering the Maidan regime there by spreading so much cash around that everyone could steal something Not just the ruling classes Indeed, if Ukraine became a success which is long shot, in fairness it would undermine the Kremlin by showing how submission to the West means oodles of filthy lucre However, this is a costly notion and austerity loving Germans are unlikely to approve Another scheme might involve dangling visa free travel for Russians if they d agree to vote for someone else in the 2018 election, but the Dutch won t even countenance open borders for loyal ù Ukrainians And, anyway, easier movement would only really appeal to the middle classes in Moscow and St Petersburg, who were already pretty hostile to Putin before the imposition of sanctions New York Times admits Yanukovich was right not to sign#Ukraine EU deal (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /Fe4OkTnAhK Some in Brussels think increased splurging on media messaging could yield dividends, but, given how EU states already outspend Moscow by huge amounts, this is a pipe dream For all the fear mongering about Russian television and web services, the entire state broadcasting budget both domestic and foreign is less than one third of what the British alone spend on the BBC network Bearing all this in mind, there seems to be only one way Eurocrats can undermine Putin One that, I will admit, is somewhat counterintuitive and probably unfathomable to Brussels how about a formal invitation for Russia to replace Britain in the European Union, on condition that it also joins the Euro? Because in the (admittedly unlikely) event the Kremlin would accept such entreaties, Putin would be gone in short order After all, look at how successful the Euro has been at destroying living standards across Europe, and the hopes and dreams of millions?

"18 Dec, 2016",Facebook‚Äôs 'anti-fake news' plan looks like effort to curb alternative media,"There are serious concerns over a social media giant s plans to debunk spurious news stories And many are puzzled about the real agenda at play Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv You don t need to worship at the altar of George Orwell to see where this is going Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as fake news on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it s proposed to implement it merits many questions Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country s popular press But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg s firm is an effective monopoly CIA meddled in hundreds of elections: Ron Paul talks Russia blaming, fake news and more on RThttps:// tdotco /qxttAcpYSmpic twitter com/1kd44g8AVH Whereas papers have always been curated by editors, their power was limited by the sheer number of competitors in every national market And the more different they were, the better for society in general However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary Of course, another big problem here is that one person s fake news ùcould be another s truth And that s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self proclaimed international fact checking network, ùwhich presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing They include Pierre Omidyar,George Sorosand Washington s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft power cutout As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine s Maidan coup in 2014 Thus, it s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of ministry of truth ùwith only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook s primary news feeds And this is very dangerous Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact checkers to sort out fake news https:// tdotco /jZmZXrpl06pic twitter com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling Because it s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices That said, nobody is disputing whether fake news ùis a problem It s just hard to find agreement on its definition For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it s often a different story Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked bynumerouscrediblesources And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging thatVladimir Putinwas using kompromat ùto destroy the reputations of his political opponents For proof they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography German politicians want 500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrshttps:// tdotco /VSGNiA2M98pic twitter com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper s readers were greeted with this soft soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins: His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K G B and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride ùAnd to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes Yet, sadly for Higgins and Bukovsky, of course his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child pornimageshimself, as research Then there s theGuardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune without any explanation suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the sameWashington Post These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source And we can t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of alove childand Moscow developing a Star Trek esqueteleportation device Are all these not examples of fake news? ùBut given that they are establishment names in the western press, don t expect Poynter to

"20 Aug, 2016",West remembers 1991 Soviet coup anniversary for all the wrong reasons,"Once a year the Western media covers Russia with at least a semblance of respect and sympathy that is August 19, the anniversary of the 1991 coup but their reasoning for doing so is severely flawed Dmitry Babich, born in Moscow in 1970, has worked for various media outlets for 25 years, including the Moscow News, RIA Novosti news agency, and Sputnik International He is currently editor at InoSMI Internet media project, and is a frequent guest on BBC, Al Jazeera and CNN, commenting on international affairs and history Dmitry Babich, born in Moscow in 1970, has worked for various media outlets for 25 years, including the Moscow News, RIA Novosti news agency, and Sputnik International He is currently editor at InoSMI Internet media project, and is a frequent guest on BBC, Al Jazeera and CNN, commenting on international affairs and history August 19, 1991 marks the day when the rule of an eight member State Emergency Committee (GKChP) went into effect for less than three days, collapsing on August 21 after a confrontation with a crowd of protesters in central Moscow In the last two years, a consensus has established itself among both the Russian pro Western liberals ù and the Western pro liberal ù writers on Russia that this event in 1991 was the Russian variant of the revolution of dignity ùThat name had been originally coined for the bloody Maidan coup in Ukraine [The Ukrainian so called revolution of dignity ù was a three month long street fight in 2013 2014 that led to the ouster of the legally elected president Viktor Yanukovich; 13 policemen plus dozens of violent protesters were killed and Ukraine plunged into a civil war] The US and European mainstream media (MSM) could not find a better way for exposing its lies and double standards NYT s writer Masha Gessen, for example, who had no experience of living in Russia before 1991,fails to understandthe trap she gets herself into when she compares the Russian events of 1991 to the velvet revolutions ùin Eastern Europe, and when she argues that life in Russia now is similar to the life in the former Soviet Union The problem is that both of these MSM glorified revolutions of dignity ù are revered in the West, but they are deeply unpopular inside the former Soviet Union itself, especially in Russia Why? Because both of these events led to the two greatest misfortunes in the life of the USSR s Slavic heartland since the end of the World War II in 1945: the division of families and the crumbling of production as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, as well as the first major fallout between Eastern Slavic nations as a result of the violent regime change ù in Kiev in 2014 Apolitical people in Russia and Ukraine may not remember the exact sequence of events during the coups in 1991 and 2014, but it would be nearly impossible to find a single Russian family that does not have bitter memories of the collapse of the USSR in 1991 and, likewise, would not be terrified by the war in Ukraine, which the violently installed anti Russian regime in Kiev blames on Russian aggression ù A recent opinion poll, conducted in the framework of the project Sputnik Opinion, revealed that 64 percent of Russians believed that life in the Soviet Union was better than the life they had after its collapse The majority of the polled in 9 out of 11 former Soviet republics had the same opinion This reported attitude of the Russian people is no aberration of memory ùIn the vast majority of families, the collapse of the historic unified state on the territory of the former Russian empire and the Russo Ukrainian conflict are seen as senseless tragedies These tragedies have nothing in common with dignity ù, democracy ù, fight against totalitarianism ùand other such lofty words that writers like Masha Gessen like to employ There is nothing dignified about the death of thousands of people and the impoverishment of millions, ùsays Boris Mezhuyev, a former deputy editor in chief of Izvestia daily, who in the 1990s covered the aftermath of the August 1991 coup and the subsequent collapse of the USSR One of the main lies of the Western press was to call the dissolution of the Soviet Union a bloodless process The conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ossetia, Moldova and Transdniester, which started in 1987 1991, only escalated after the USSR fell apart And in the Russo Ukrainian relations the wound of Ukraine s amputation ù was simply frozen between 1991 and 2014, with blood gushing profusely as soon as the anesthetizing ice started to melt in 2014 ù Well, talk of dignity ùmixed with bloodless ùvelvet is not the only clich√©d lie which the Western media has been attaching to the events of August 1991 for decades As a person who witnessed firsthand the events of August 1991 in my capacity as a reporter for Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, I have an impression of being present at a festival of lies every year when I read Western articles devoted to the anti Gorbachev coup ù The lies consist not so much in the details, as in the general pattern in which the events of those days are described Andreas Ruesch in hisarticle The Stolen Victory ùpublished in the influential Swiss daily Neue Zuricher Zeitung (NZZ) offers this classical ùpattern Here it is in a nutshell: In August 1991, a group of evil old communists decided to turn back the wheel of history ù; they failed, because Gorbachev refused to agree to their demands on the eve of the coup ùon August 18, 1991; now, 25 years later, the same evil Chekists (members of the Soviet security services) are back in power, because democracy never took a firm root ùunder Yeltsin Not only was I present at the scene of the events in August 1991, I interviewed several GKChP members, as well as Gorbachev himself, and I can say that every link in the NZZ offered chain of events is a simplified version of reality, to say the least First, even Andreas Ruesch agrees that Gorbachev s economic reforms (or, rather, the absence of them) made him lose any kind of authority in the eyes of the public ùbefore August 1991 One could also add that the unified state that had existed on the territory of the former Russian Empire for 300 years was collapsing In the Union Treaty, due to be signed on August 20 1991, Gorbachev managed to get signatories from only eight out of the Soviet Union s 15 constituent republics Ukraine, the biggest Soviet republic after Russia with a population of 50 million, promised to review ù the possibility of signing the treaty not earlier than in mid September Yet timing was crucial because the problem of transferring taxes from the newly sovereign ùrepublics to the Soviet Union s budget in Moscow had not been resolved Without taxes, the federal Soviet state would die (as it did a few months later, even before the official death of the USSR in December 1991) So, the action of the GKChP s members on August 19 of 1991 was not an illegal seizure of power by a part of the Soviet leadership, but rather an attempt by a group of the most active Kremlin officials to retrieve the power the Kremlin had already lost between 1989 and 1991 Second, the relationship between Gorbachev and the putschists ù was far more complicated than a confrontation between a reformist nicknamed Gorby (who still celebrates his birthdays in London) and a bunch of old reactionaries Gorbachev himself realized that the country was collapsing That is the reason he himself pondered the introduction of the state of emergency in the Soviet Union But he did not want to take the responsibility for this move personally, since it could spoil his credentials in the West, ùthe late Valery Boldin, the former head of Gorbachev s Secretariat in 1991 and one of the key figures of the coup, told me in an interview in 2001, five years before his death in 2006 That is why several GKChP members and me, we all came to see him on August 18, on the eve of the announcement of the state of emergency Having listened to our arguments, Gorbachev said To hell with you, go ahead His later claims that he had no access to phone lines and that he was resisting the actions of GKChP these claims do not hold any water ù Boldin may not be believed 100 percent, since during the interview he had a vested interest in justifying his actions, which he had already suffered for (in 1991 he was charged with high treason and spent several months in a Moscow jail) But Gorbachev s phrase To hell with you, go ahead was mentioned in the memoirs of several GKChP members and is not disputed by Gorbachev himself So, here is my question to Andreas Ruesch and his article: 'Can the August coup ù be called anti Gorbachev, if the plotters claim to have acted on Gorbachev s orders, corroborating their stories with documents and matching eyewitness accounts?' There are many other truths which do not match the Western media s good reformers vs evil communists ù model We also wanted to conduct privatization and we realized the need to switch to the market mechanisms in the formation of prices, ùthe former Soviet prime minister Valentin Pavlov (also a GKChP member) told me in an interview in 2001 We just did not want to do it in the way Yeltsin did in the 1990s ù Privatization of state assets unjustly conducted under Yeltsin in the 1990s led to the formation of the powerful oligarch class, which introduced and crushed a huge chunk of Russia s free media and whose attempts to return to power are still hurting Russia (one could cite the lawsuit for $50 billion from Russia in compensations, filed by the former oligarchic owners of the YUKOS oil major and temporarily given a green light by an arbitration court in the Hague) The truth is that Gorbachev was no Salvador Allende and Yeltsin was not that 'Russian hero speaking from a tank' referring to the familiar image described as his high moment in the Western press Instead, they were two leaders who both failed their country and their people They failed to fulfill the mandate of the people, given to them at a referendum of March 17, 1991, when more than 70 percent of the Soviet Union s citizens voted for the preservation of a unified state Both Gorbachev and Yeltsin made concessions to the West in a vain hope of making it Russia s ally and supporter History has shown that both men were at best na√Øve by attempting to pursue such a goal Jack Matlock, who was the US ambassador to the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, the truly velvet ù years for US Soviet relations, wrote several books and articles in an effort to prove that the United States did not try to expedite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which went apace in 1989 1991 This may be true at least as far as the former president George Herbert Walker Bush is concerned In July 1991, right before the Moscow coup, Bush made aconciliatory speechto the Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev, urging them to have patience in their drive for Ukrainian independence and not resort to violence Bush proved to be right in his advice (Ukraine was given self rule under Gorbachev, and complete independence came just a few weeks later), but the media warmongers from The Washington Post and the New York Times still cannot forgive Bush the senior for his actions Indeed, William Safire slammed it as the Chicken Kiev Speech ùObviously, President Barack Obama and Victoria Nuland, who did not chicken out of support for the peaceful protesters ùin Kiev (that happened to kill 13 policemen with 'peaceful' Molotov cocktails), were treated by the mainstream press much more kindly than George Herbert Walker Bush and his recommended pacifism ùin 1991 There is no doubt that the West did not expect such a speedy disintegration of the Soviet Union and for the time being there was a pause in the Western military pressure, which Moscow had to put up with for decades under the USSR, ùsaid Yevgeny Saburov, the minister of economy in the short lived post coup government of Russian Federation in 1991 There were sceptics: Bush and Clinton s intelligence chief Robert Gates continued to think deep into 1992 that the whole democratization business in Russia was just a ploy to keep the West off guard on Moscow s evil plans There were also liars: Bill Clinton said in an interview in 1992 that the US would not object if the republics of the former Soviet Union decided to live together again When the West realized that the Soviet Union was gone for good, the pressure gradually resumed Already in 1993, NATO took the decision to expand to Poland and several other East European states, burying Gorbachev s illusions about Europe without the dividing lines ùThe bombing of Yugoslavia followed in 1999, George W Bush s Iraqi adventure started in 2003 The Ukrainian tragedy was not long in the waiting neither, degenerating into war in 2014 Did the United States rightly handle all the opportunities which the collapse of the communist system in Russia had to offer? ùSerge Schmemann, the editor of International Herald Tribune, asked during a talk at a reception in the US embassy in Moscow I am not sure we used these opportunities Our main failure was that we could not IMAGINE a different Russia Not an enemy, not a failed state, not a danger ù One could not put it better The majority of politicians in the US still cannot imagine a different Russia Instead, they wax nostalgic about the illusory events of 1991",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/356586-25-years-west-august-coup/
"17 Jun, 2016",How US Senate is being fed misinformation by Russia policy advisors,"Watching a recent US Senate hearing on Russia is eye opening It proves just how poorly American politicians are being briefed on the country and it helps explain a lot of the trouble Washington has in dealing with Moscow Let s face it, US Senatehearingswon t be prime time entertainment any time soon They are, with few exceptions, long winded affairs, heavy on jargon However, occasionally one comes along that promises to be a bit more of a draw We got lucky with one blockbuster event last week, when the Committee on Foreign Relations held a panel to decide how to handle Russia What made this gathering stand out were the participants The presence of Michael Carpenter, representing the Pentagon, would have been noteworthy in itself But the fact that he was paired with Victoria Nuland, of the Maidan cookies and f**k the EU fame, practically had us reaching for the popcorn Right now, Nuland owns possibly the most influential voice when it comes to forming Washington s policy towards Moscow The fact that her husband, Robert Kagan, hasemergedas a pivotal supporter of Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign has even fedspeculationthat she might be in the running to become the next Secretary of State While that s possibly a stretch, there is no doubt that in a possible future Clinton Presidency, Nuland is likely to play a major role Given her job remit, you d expect her to have an impressive handle on the facts surrounding Russia Indeed, you d imagine they d be watertight, proving that Nuland was worthy of the exalted title of Assistant Secretary at the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs of the US Department of State Furthermore, it d also be reasonable to expect that Carpenter, as Deputy Assistant Secretary Of Defense with responsibility for Russia, Ukraine, And Eurasia would have a genuine expert s grasp of the region Instead, both Carpenter and Nuland s testimonies were littered with basic errors This raises serious questions about the quality of advice on Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe and Eurasia that the US government is receiving, and the resulting effect on policy choices The sheer number of errors means that only a snapshot of the disinformation presented by the duo is possible a prospect more frightening than entertaining Right from the start, the committee Chairman, Senator Bob Corker, insisted that Russia joined the civil war in Syria ùIn reality, Syria s legitimate government (the one with a seat at the United Nations and other international bodies),requestedRussia s assistance in its battle against terrorists By contrast, America s ongoing intervention in Syria is illegal under international law Neither Nuland nor Carpenter attempted to correct this Next up, Senator Ben Cardin opened with reference to Russia s actions in Georgia in 2008 ùMichael Carpenter echoed the negative view of Moscow s role as the aggressor in the conflict In actual fact, even the EUagreedthat Georgia s pro American President, Mikhail Saakashvili, was the aggressor who started that conflict, when he attacked South Ossetia Once again, the supposed experts ùmade no effort to correct the record Then things got rather bizarre Cardin thanked Vladimir Kara Murza (who spoke later) for all that you do for the people of the Russian Federation ùIt s unclear what mandate Cardin thinks Kara Murza has inside Russia? He has never been elected to political office and currentlyworksas a lobbyist for Michael Khodorkovsky, who wasconvictedof tax evasion in his homeland and is currently wanted for questioning on new charges We must wonder, did Cardin actually mean thank you for all you do for American interests in Russia? ù Next up was Senator David Perdue, who, like Cardin, insisted that Georgia is under increasing pressure and danger from Russia That seems unlikely as relations between the two countries have beenimproving Or did Perdue confuse declining American dominance of Georgian politics with Kremlin aggression? Then of course a stable relationship between Russia and Georgia might become an issue (though not for Georgia, obviously) Rather than telling Perdue that Moscow and Tbilisi are getting on better these days, expert Carpenter replied that Russia currently occupies about 20 percent of Georgia ùThere was no mention of the previous Georgian government s military assaults on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are the reasons for the Russian presence He again insisted on mentioning the Russian invasion of 2008 ù which is not at all how the independent EU report on the conflict described it Senator Jeanne Shaheen s turn was next, with a question about Russian misinformation ùNuland decided to reply with a bit of falsity of her own The total appropriation of US State Department, USAID, and Broadcast Board of Governors (BBG) on the US side is about $100 million to counter Russian propaganda , ùshe claimed Nuland then suggested that this, relatively small, amount is spread across a wide range of activities and is so meager the State Department is forced to throw another $88 million of USAID cash into the pot to keep the show on the road in terms of training Russian journalists ùand trying to influence things inside the country Nuland then claimed that Russia spends at least ù $400 million on similar projects This is incredible obfuscation RT s 2016budgetis 17 billion rubles ($260 million at current exchange rates) Meanwhile, the BBGrequested$751 5 million for their services this year Nuland is trying to hoodwink Senators into believing that Russia is spending four times more on the US on media services, when in truth, it s America which splashes out almost three times the Russian allocation In response to Shaheeh s next query, Nuland reveals that America is conducting secret training camps in the EU to influence Russian journalists She continues by admitting the US is funding and controlling Russian language outlets based in the Baltics She also admits the US has programs both INSIDE and outside Russia ùto help activists who want to work with us ù Imagine if Russia had programs inside the US, or say Germany, to do the same thing? It would be called hybrid war Or weaponizing information ùOr similar Nuland also says we have a large number of Russian journalists who are working with us and others in Europe, to try to ensure there is independent news going back into Russia ùIt seems that she s indicating here that the US government might be supporting Meduza, a controversial Riga based news service that refuses to reveal its funding Later, during a question about NATO funding and its continued relevance, Nuland essentially equates Russia to ISIS as a threat to the US dominated organization When it s so easy to lie about media funding and wars, it s also a breeze to deliver deception that creates an equivalence between a modern nation state and a barbaric terrorist organization Incidentally, this week, Russia is fighting ISIS in Syria, as it has been doing for some time, while the US is busy conducting military exercises in Eastern Europe, near Russia s border However, when you deal in unreality like Nuland and Carpenter, you don t need to think about such things, much less explain them It d be better for everyone if Washington could find some actual Russian experts who are fit for purpose and know their stuff and will tell the truth to elected representatives ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/347151-us-senate-misinformation-russia/

The (nominally independent) Western media In fact, outlets just like Politico which has continued to passionatelysupporttheMaidanmovement ever since While Politico is concerned about perceived foreign media support for Trump potentially influencing the US election, it doesn t appear to worry about the opposite side of the coin that is, foreign media lambasting him Here s a sample from the British press Let s start with the Financial Times: Mr Trump is a promoter of paranoid fantasies, a xenophobe and an ignoramus His business consists of the erection of ugly monuments to his own vanity, ùwroteMartin Wolf in March Meanwhile, over at the Independent, Rupert Cornwell didn t hold back either: He s a nativist, a mercantilist and a neo isolationist, who is not afraid to turn long term allies into enemies ù At the same time, theGuardianhas been ridiculing Trump for his hair and the behavior of hisfamily Politico has nothing to say about these takedowns Then there is American coverage of Russia, which rarely involves any sort of reasoned analysis and blurs the lines between propaganda and journalism Instead of balanced reportage, it offers stuff from the comic book tradition It s all about goodies ù and baddies ù For example, serious Russia watchers know that one of the most prominent opposition leaders, AlexeyNavalny, has expressed beliefs that are firmly in the realm of hard core nationalism and outright racism Yet, US mediapresents himas some kind of secular saint Theattitudeseems to be that anything can be forgiven, so long as a person opposes Putin This black and white presentation of Russian issues goes back a long way In the mid 90s, when Russia was essentially collapsing, American journalistsbackedthe Yeltsin government to the hilt Under Yeltsin s watch,life expectancyfor men fell to 58, Russia had the most rapid HIV growth rate in the world, and thepopulation lossoutpaced the Stalin era Yes, you ve read that right: demographically, Russia suffered greater proportional losses under Yeltsin than under a man considered to be one of the most tyrannical rulers in history The country became so devoid of hope that in 1998, Russian high school students ranked prostitute and hired assassin above scientist , engineer and researcher as attractive career choices Yet the US media just couldn t praise Yeltsin highly enough In 1996, the incumbent faced the Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov in a tightly contested election It was an open secret that the ballot wasrigged In point of fact, even the OSCE s mission chief, Michael Meadowcroft,admittedit but only years after the Washington friendly election results were allowed to stand However, American outlets not only ignored the fraud, they helped cover it up The Washington Post gleefully smeared Zyuganov as aStalinist, while the New York Timescalledthe result a victory for democracy ù American correspondents in Moscow were fully aware that whole districts had apparently voted almost unanimously for Yeltsin, yet reported no suspicions Years later, Meadowcroft said: In Chechnya they d been bombed out of existence, and there they were all supposedly voting for Yeltsin It s like what happens in Cameroon ù In July 1996, Time Magazine went further It openlycelebratedhow American advisers had stepped in to ensure Yeltsin won the election Now, 20 years later, the American media is publishing alarmist articles about their Russian counterparts allegedly favoring a US election candidate Let s just think for a moment here Trump has stated that he wants to get along with Russia ù On the other hand, Clinton hascomparedPutin to Hitler She s alsocalledfor even more anti Russia sanctions Surely, it s blindingly obvious that no Russian would support her in such circumstances? Even Putin s welcome of Trump s comparatively moderate stance toward Russia is apparently an entirely inappropriate reaction in the Western media s eyes Yet, at the same time when the US president travels across the ocean to openly advocate against Brexit, they raise no objections In any case, Moscow s influence on the US election is negligible, just as its clout on Brexit is trivial and its impact on the Dutch EU referendum was slim This Holy Trinity of scaremongering is so removed from reality as to be beyond ridicule The blame Russia roadshow won t end until such time as the Western elite has a government it favors in the Kremlin The hopes, dreams and wishes of the Russian people don t amount to a hill of beans to the likes of Politico ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/342680-elections-west-media-russia-/

I m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily 1944 opens with the chilling description: When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we re not guilty ù I had to write it It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it, ùsaysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar Armenian family I m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow, went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry Ding a dong, performed by Teach In back in 1975 But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead singer of Teach In Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia There s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done especially if, like me, you are a long standing Eurovision fan who s been watching the event since the 1970s The provocative, politically motivated decision to chose 1944 as their Song for Europe goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons When Johnny Logan performed What s Another Year , the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn t singing about the Anglo Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of 1944 ? Believe it or not, it s not just Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars who have had some very bad things done to them in the past The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999 The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars Russia could sing about the 5 7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France s invasion of 1812 The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years And so on Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities and even genocides Few countries in Europe haven t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point and on top of that there s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on and singing about today It s not the first time those with an anti Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: We don t Wanna Put In The artists did not deny their song was a protest against Russian policies The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so Therulesof Eurovision state that No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest ùUkraine s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There s method in Kiev s apparent madness If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she just had to write , in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent We ll all be under pressure to give the song Douze Points to show our solidarity with Ukraine If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that free speech is under threat in Europe because we can t hear 1944 I m sure we ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala The West s free speech crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites They didn t say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year s Eurovision not for the lyrics of their song, which was called Wars for nothing but because one of the captions in the song s videocontainedthe words: 2014 Gaza two thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children Israel wasn t mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war But that didn t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary s broadcasting authority, with the result that the offending words in the video were removed While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting Israel who s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests Hungary s Eurovision entry there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting Wars for nothing Already the sort of media outlets you d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and 1944 Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them I would not want to see history repeat itself, Jamalatoldthe US Congress funded station RFE/RL is smart power Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for, saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics! The Ukrainian authorities are going to try to use the song capitalizing on the tragedy of the Tartars to impose on European viewers a false picture of alleged harassment of the Tartars in the Russian Crimea, Crimea s deputy prime minister Russlan Balbek hassaid He s right to be offended The head of Ukraine s National Remembrance Museum has also done his best tostir things up He said that should Jamala win the contest in Stockholm, next year s event would be held in Sevastopol Now there s just one small problem with that Sevastopol is no longer part of Ukraine It s part of Russia The city council of Sevastopol has declared that the only way it could host Eurovision 2017 is if Russia wins this year Does Ukraine really want us to go to war over where the Eurovision Song Contest is held? To debase an international song contest in the way that Ukraine has done is disgraceful By focusing on crimes which occurred in the 1940s, Jamala is also helping to divert international attention away from the economic plight of Ukraine today A country that was once the food basket of eastern Europe is now, thanks to the illegal US/EU sponsored coup of 2014, a veritable basket case It s hard to get one s head round the figures Ukraine s foreign trade has slumped 31 percent in just one year Ukraine s foreign trade collapses 31% in just one year, post EU backed couphttps:// tdotco /xVfNUpkOiH Inflation last February wasestimatedto be running at 64 5 percent a month Ukraine s GDP meanwhile fell for six successive quarters following the democratic revolution of February 2014, while real wages fell by almost 25 percent in the year May 2014 May 2015 The people in Maidan were supposed to protesting against corruption, but Ukraine surprise, surprise, remains themost corruptnation in Europe In fact, looking at how wretched everyday life is for ordinary people in liberated Ukraine today, one can fully understand why Jamala is so keen to take us back to 1944 If she was really brave, she d have penned a song called 2014 that discussed the regime change activities of Victoria Nuland and their consequences She handed us cookies out in the square, and when we next looked at our wage packets, there was nothing there You can follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333580-ukraines-song-europe-jamala/

 Crimea last year was prompted by which of the following a ) a very particular set of historical circumstances, allied to
 the will of the overwhelming majority of the local population b ) Vladimir Putin s desire to launch a blitzkrieg military
 campaign, complete with goose stepping Russian soldiers marching
 across Europe? If you are not a raving mad neocon or someone who has
 difficulties with reality, the correct answer is a Crimea was
 Russian territory for centuries and had been transferred to
 Ukraine as part of an administrative re alignment at a time when
 both states were part of the Soviet Union The peninsula is as
 Russian as Cornwall is British or Texas is American Furthermore,
 not even the most myopic anti Russia activist questions the fact
 that most Crimean residents wished to join the Russian
 Federation READ MORE: Russia has no aggressive plans, will
 always prefer political settlement Putin Given what has happened in Ukraine since, it s unlikely that many
 people in Simferopol or Yalta would change that stance 
 Certainly, Crimean integration into the Russia state has been far
 from straightforward Western sanctions targeted at local
 denizens haven t helped in that regard and neither has the lack
 of a physical connection with the Russian mainland However, the alternative would have been far worse Ukraine is
 now afailed state Its economy has been decimated,
 corruption is arguably even more rampant than before the Maidan
 coup and a civil war rages sporadically in the east Compared to
 Ukraine, Crimea is Narnia Then again, almost every place on the

 trend for autumn winter 2015 Despite the relish with which lazy Western journalism and a
 highly organized NATO information campaign lambasts Putin s Russia ùas a warmongering rogue state, the
 facts tell another tale During the past 15 years, the Russian
 army has only entered the sovereign territory of two foreign
 states, with Crimea counting as one of those occasions In 2008, former President Medvedev sent his forces into Georgia
 in response to Tbilisi s aggression against South Ossetia After
 five days of fighting, Russian troops controlled much of
 Georgia s territory Nevertheless, within two months, the Kremlin
 had withdrawn all its soldiers This scenario doesn t sound very

 23, 2015 Long before the eve of the Euromaidan protests that led to the
 Ukraine coup d etat Washington called democratic reformation
 [today], Victoria Nuland was an instigator in Iraq under then
 Vice President Dick Cheney Nuland was a democracy
 promotion officer back then too, one so adept at making
 liberty happen she was later promoted by Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton, first to State Department spokesperson, then
 later to her current position as Assistant Secretary of State for
 European Affairs In hindsight, there s no wonder Moscow raised eyebrows when
 Nuland appeared in Maidan Square sharing loaves and fishes with
 protesters there The veteran State Department operative is
 virulently anti Russia, despite proclaiming her love for the
 country Between Nuland and NATO Commander General Philip
 Breedlove it s hard to figure who has been more in favor of the
 US arming Kiev As for her killer instinct in
 spreading democratic ideals, Nuland is a cagey operator On the
 first day of the recent Munich Security Conference Nuland and
 Breedlove held a meeting of delegates behind closed doors to
 discuss a strategy for getting Europe to agree to arm Ukraine 
 Nuland was credited with saying: While talking to the Europeans this weekend, you need to
 make the case that Russia is putting in more and more offensive
 stuff while we want to help the Ukrainians defend against these
 systems Now, she is also coming to Russia to hold talks with Lavrov
 deputies, Sergey Ryabkov and Grigory Karasin The talks are
 expected to focus on Ukraine and Minsk Accords If the Kerry visit to Sochi could be seen as an olive branch to
 President Putin, then choosing an alternative voice for direct
 connecting the so called Normandy Four and America would have
 been advisable here Speaking after talks on Saturday with
 Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, Nuland attempted to put
 herself and the United States diplomatic mission at the forefront
 of negotiations Washington tried to scuttle from the beginning 
 Nuland stressed: The United States deepens our engagement in the Minsk
 implementation process in lockstep with our European allies and
 partners, with the EU and particularly with the Normandy
 powers ù Outside deepening ù a Washington engagement that has at every
 turn been adversarial toward Russia and the rebels, Nuland gave
 the Obama administration s insistence ù on a ceasefire on the
 borders of the Donbass Now that a peace accord and a reversal of
 EU US Russia sanctions madness seems at hand, the very
 instigators of chaos want a place at the peace table If ever

 not acquiesce to Kerry (for Obama) begging and allow the US
 officials to save some face for those waiting back home along the
 Potomac The images from Sochi bear out that Vladmir Putin seemed
 amused (maybe disgusted?) To conclude, as we

"10 Oct, 2014","Eurasian Economic Union: Despite Western myths, a remarkably sensible project","The recent ratification of the treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union by the Belarusian parliament removed the last doubts about the start of this ambitious project, which involves a market of 170 mn people and $2 7 trillion of combined domestic product Since the treaty has already been ratified by the Russian
 parliament, there is little doubt that Kazakhstan s lawmakers
 will soon follow suit After all, the treaty was signed by
 presidents Vladimir Putin, Aleksandr Lukashenko and Nursultan
 Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan s capital, Astana, in May, and it would
 be preposterous for the hosts to drag their feet So, what kind of countries will this Union bring together? Is it
 indeed just a veiled ùattempt at reconstructing the
 Soviet Union, as Hillary Clinton put it when this project 
 Vladimir Putin s brainchild was first announced in 2012? And
 who will it unite the rich and hopeful or throwbacks to
 the Soviet past ùwho can t get rid of their dependence on
 Russia, as the mainstream Western media writes? Let us look at the facts There is a sure way of telling which of
 the post Soviet countries are more or less wealthy and which are
 not you just have to look at the migrant workers coming to
 Moscow to do non prestigious jobs There are millions of those
 arriving from the countries which are considered by the West to
 be European hopefuls ùand which signed association
 agreements with the EU Ukrainians and Moldovans in the first
 place But there are very few from Belarus and there are
 literally none from Kazakhstan Why? The answer is simple: the
 average monthly salary in Ukraine has been about $350 in 2014,
 while in Kazakhstan it is almost twice as much $689 When
 people get decent salaries, they prefer to make money at home So
 much for the European hopefuls ùand the Eurasian throwbacks ùLet us take a closer look at one of the
 bulwark countries of the Eurasian Economic Union, Kazakhstan Kazakhstan is a country with a 17 million strong, multiethnic
 population where Slavic speaking Russians and Turkic speaking
 Kazakhs form the largest two groups It is Russia s neighbor,
 rich in oil and gas, and also has a very good strategic position,
 linking China, Muslim Central Asia, the European part of Russia,
 Caucasus and Iran (which are right behind the oil rich Caspian
 Sea) But historically, Kazakhstan was much poorer and less
 developed educationally than Ukraine or Moldova It was also
 considered not globalized ùenough, being far removed
 from European capitals and being a part of the politically
 volatile Central Asian region, with its coups, revolutions and
 fears of the Afghan Islamist influence However, modern Kazakhstan, with its ATM machines in every
 village, futurist architecture, 70 percent of the population
 being active Internet users and 28th place in the global index on
 e government, does not look like an isolated provincial country
 at all Its proximity to Russia was viewed by its president,
 Nursultan Nazarbayev, not as an impediment, but rather as an
 advantage At the recent Caspian summit in Astrakhan, Russia s Vladimir
 Putin and Kazakhstan s Nursultan Nazarbayev were in 100 percent
 agreement on the future legal status of the Caspian Sea This
 year Kazakhstan is on track for 4 percent economic growth (The
 European Bank for the Reconstruction and Development expected
 Kazakhstan to make 5 5 percent, but the forecast was downgraded
 in May because of the EU s sanctions against Russia, which also
 adversely affect Kazakhstan) The other thorny truth for the Washington based nation builders ùis that Kazakhstan, with its
 independent multi vector foreign policy, is now showing better
 results than some of the faithful students of the US in the
 post Soviet space The outflow of the Russian population, visible
 in the 1990s, has dwindled in recent years, and now the
 demographic situation in Kazakhstan is much better than in the
 Baltic EU member states, which saw a dramatic fall in childbirth
 and a continuing labor migration to the EU countries Kazakhstan
 is much more peaceful than the Western darlings of Ukraine and
 Georgia, with their civil wars Kazakhstan did not have coups and
 West applauded revolutions, with people protecting their
 vote ùwith Molotov cocktails and the activist ùhabit of throwing the undesired officials into trash containers 
 Kazakhstan has had the same president since 1991 But somehow,
 Eurasian Kazakhstan took the 28th place in the United Nations 
 e government development index EGDI ( European ù Ukraine did not
 make it even into the top 30 in Europe) Having an opportunity to
 have your driver s license delivered in two hours, to check your
 tax situation or medical data at any time of night or day online
 all of these small bits of e democracy ùare probably
 worth the inconvenience of NOT seeing the constant rotation of
 Mrs Tymoshenko s and Mr Poroshenko s faces on your TV, don t
 you think? What was the difference that made Kazakhstan, formerly not the
 best developed Central Asian territory of the Soviet Union, more
 successful than the European Ukraine? Well, Kazakhstan simply did
 not do several self defeating things the nationalists regimes of
 Viktor Yushchenko and Petro Poroshenko did in Ukraine Kazakhstan
 did not declare its Russian speaking population an obstacle
 on our road to Europe ù(an expression of the virulently
 pro Maidan Ukrainskaya Pravda) Also, Kazakhstan was not as
 obsessed with the EU as Ukraine, preferring to take the best from
 both Asia and Europe At the recent UN Global e Government Forum 2014, held in Astana,
 Kazakh officials did not hide the fact that they tried to model
 the national e government system after the South Korean one But
 if we bear in mind that South Korea has taken the 1st place in
 the UN s e government rating three times in a row, the idea to
 copy THIS Asia might not seem all that ill conceived The South Korean officials, speaking at the Astana gathering,
 returned the favor, saying that estimates show Kazakhstan to have
 the best developed e government network among the land locked
 countries, which generally tend to be homes to the world s bottom billion ùof poor people In less than two decades, Astana has managed to twin itself with
 Moscow, Kiev and Tbilisi at the same time If we add Beijing and
 Warsaw (and Gdansk) to this only seemingly contradictory
 collection of twin cities, the multi vector ùpicture of
 Kazakhstan s foreign policy orientation becomes complete This
 foreign policy mix is pretty well suited by Astana s futuristic
 architectural skyline where even the British architect Lord
 Foster is giving his creations the likeness of nomads yurts and
 where throwbacks to Soviet pseudo Gothic towers are neighbors to
 the 21st century eggs and torts the ones which would make
 London s City look like a collection of Georgian country
 mansions Unlike the US, Kazakhstan did not applaud the revolutions in
 Ukraine and in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, where the violent change
 of government in 2010 led to hundreds of deaths Kazakhstan only
 tried to help, harboring refugees and providing diplomatic
 mediation For some reason, the economically prosperous Kazakhstan managed
 to avoid both the Russian irredentism ù(for which in
 the first post Soviet years there seemed to be a lot more reasons
 than in Slavic Ukraine) and the constant arguments over gas
 supplies to and from Russia At the same time, Kazakhstan managed
 to stay sovereign and independent, developing Kazakh language as
 the national one but not to the detriment of Russian, which
 remained the language of interethnic communication and learning So, these facts might explain why the Eurasian Union is expected
 to be joined by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan before the end of the
 year Despite all the difficulties, being in the same group with
 Kazakhstan looks definitely a better perspective than being in
 the same group with Ukraine Dmitry Babich for RTDmitry Babich is a political analyst for Voice of Russia radio

"25 Sep, 2014",Forget napalm ‚Äì President Wimp loves the smell of coffee in the morning,"Colonel Kilgore, in Coppola s Apocalypse Now, ù said he loved the smell of napalm in the morning By way of contrast, US President Barack Obama, prefers the smell of coffee is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Kilgore liked to go surfing Barack Obama prefers a leisurely
 round of golf (Instead of Charlie don t surf! ù try saying:
 ISIS don t putt! It wouldn t really cut it in the Marines ) Kilgore liked the music of Richard Wagner, because it scares the
 shit out of the slopes ù Obama prefers Marvin Gaye Instead of President Macho, we ve got President Wimp or so we
 are led to believe Obama s so called#LatteSalutehas come in for much criticism, a sign
 that such a man is unfit to lead America into yet another war If
 only we had a Colonel Kilgore, John McCain or Mitt Romney in
 charge or a modern day John Wayne! Hell, yeah he d kick IS s
 butt alright and show those jihadists not to mess with Uncle Sam! But in many ways, the image of the president with the coffee cup
 is perfect for what US imperialism needs at present It s fully
 in line with the non macho, or even wimpish image of Obama, the
 reluctant warrior, the man who would prefer to spend his time
 trying to hit birdies on the golf course, or listening to Marvin
 Gaye on his iPod, rather than getting involved in yet another
 Middle East conflict This image counts for quite a lot in selling
 US foreign policy and getting support for it in Western Europe Here we must give credit where its due, even if it s through
 gritted teeth: US imperialism has a genius for reinventing
 itself After the Bush years, the Empire desperately needed a new
 kind of front man The trouble with Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and co
 was that they were too obvious, too easy to protest against, too
 similar to Colonel Kilgore in their obvious love of war and
 conquest The hardcore fanatical neo cons cheered them on, but the more
 intelligent imperialists realized that they had done great damage
 to the cause of Pax Americana, and that a new kind of president
 was needed to extend US global hegemony and take things on to the
 next stage One who would talk the language of dialogue and
 negotiation and stress theneedfor the US to act multilaterally,
 someone who would talk of a new beginning between the United
 States and Muslims around the world, ù but who would still,
 like Bush, carry on with the Permanent War agenda I remember the first time I saw Barack Obama on American TV in
 2006 It was hard not be impressed He spoke of his opposition to
 the Iraq war, maintaining that it was the wrong war ù
 He came over as personable, articulate and sophisticated He was
 a throwback to the sort of Democrats we had in the 1960s and
 70s A stark contrast to that clapped out catastrophe George W 
 Bush Hillary The Hawk Clinton was the favorite to beat Obama in the
 race for the Democratic nomination, but the smart money was on
 the more doveish ù senator from Illinois The great thing about Obama from the viewpoint of the more
 intelligent US imperialists was that he could regain liberal left
 support for Pax Americana, and help reduce the widespread
 anti Americanism in the west which had grown in the Bush years to
 record levels He would be able to rebuild bridges with Europe He was, in short, the sort of president that pro American western
 liberal leftists who had fallen out of love with the Imperial
 power in the Bush years craved The fact that he had a real
 chance of becoming America s first black president, in a country
 where legalized racial segregation had existed in the not too
 distant past and where black people still faced racism, only
 increased his appeal The Guardianreportedon the enthusiastic reception the presidential
 hopeful received in Berlin in the summer of 2008: Again and again he uttered sentences that could never have
 come from the mouth of George W Bush, and Berlin could not have
 been more grateful ù Liberals and many progressives were euphoric when Obama made it
 to the White House, and believed a new era was dawning Anyone who predicted amid the euphoria of November 2008 that the
 self same Obama, the critic of the Iraq war, would lead Americans
 into even more military conflicts, would have been dismissed as a
 hopeless cynic and an anti American obsessive ù But so it has
 proved This week s attacks on Islamic State positions in Syria mean that
 Obama has bombed no less than seven different countries in six
 years All this comes from a man who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
 2009 There s been a new Cold War too, to go with the hot ones 
 The man who promised a reset ù in relations with Russia has taken
 his country and other western nations into a new economic trade
 war with Moscow after the US engineered, along with the EU, a
 highly provocative regime change in a country bordering Russia Yet still the image persists of a president who is reluctant to
 go to war, or to cause too much trouble Part of that is due to
 Obama s preference to let others take the front seat on foreign
 policy In Libya, it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who made the
 running and who tastelessly gloated over the brutal killing of
 Muammar Gaddafi when regime change ù was achieved In Ukraine, it was the State Department s Victoria Nuland who
 handed out the cookies to the Maidan protesters and whodiscussedwho should and shouldn t be in the
 government with the US Ambassador On Syria, it s been neocon politicians and pundits and the
 pro Israel lobby who have been pushing tirelessly for US military
 action to remove President Bashar Assad and his government to
 break the Damascus/Tehran/Hezbollah alliance When it looked like
 they were finally going to get what they wanted, last summer
 Obama backed down on airstrikes after the UK parliament voted
 No and Russia came up with a face saving plan Neocons may call him a wimp , but The President Who Would Rather
 Play Golf is exactly what the Empire has needed over the past few
 years It has needed a front man who doesn t appear to like war,
 but who nevertheless keeps on coming back for more He s someone
 who talks the language of peace and conflict resolution, and not
 interfering in other nations affairs, but who still works, like
 presidents before him, to enforce regime change ù on governments
 that the US elite wants toppled Those who believed Obama would be radically different to Bush showed a breathtaking
 naivety regarding the power of the US military industrial complex
 and the huge influence that the pro Israel lobby, Saudi Arabia,
 and the Arab oil states have on US foreign policy Even if he had really wanted to stop the war, ù Obama would have
 been unable to do so as he s no more than the pilot of an
 imperial juggernaut whose controls have already been set, and
 which purposely has no reverse gear As bad as he s been from an anti war viewpoint, the really
 depressing thing is that there were, and are, no better
 alternatives as the system simply won t allow it If you re anti war, would you really have preferred Mitt Romney
 to Obama in 2012? Criticism of Obama has been muted because of
 the sheer awfulness of the alternatives to him If we didn t get
 President Obama in 2008, we d have had President McCain And who
 would also want to line up with those reactionaries who attack
 Obama on racial grounds, or who peddle the Barack Osama 
 he s a secret Muslim ù line? There s also the fact that the man, in spite of his foreign
 policy, still remains hard to dislike on a personal basis That
 too helps the Empire, and it wouldn t have applied had the
 obnoxious McCain or smarmy Romney got elected Those who think things will improve from an anti war viewpoint
 post Obama are likely to be cruelly disappointed The face and
 even the gender of the president may change, but the policies
 will stay more or less the same Already the uber hawks are rubbing their hands with glee at the
 prospect of President Hillary Clinton, who they re sure will be
 more outwardly aggressive in foreign policy, and who will push
 the cause of Israel in the Middle East even more forcefully than
 Obama She ll probably face a pro war Republican candidate in an
 election in which the military industrial complex and big
 business simply can t lose because both candidates will do what
 is required of them if they win Anyone who might pose a
 challenge to the system, from either the genuine left, or the
 antiwar libertarian right, won t get the required funding from
 Wall Street, and in any case will be portrayed as a dangerous
 extremist ù or fanatic ù by establishment gatekeepers It s a sorry state of affairs which tells us much about the lack
 of genuine democracy in the US in the early 21st century The
 election of a man like Gerald Ford, who took over the presidency
 following Nixon s impeachment and was hailed as America s
 greatest president ù by the leftist antiwar writer
 Alexander Cockburn, or even Jimmy Carter, is now all but
 impossible such figures wouldn t make it through the filter
 system that weeds out candidates who won t do more or less
 exactly what the military industrial complex and the powerful
 lobbies want So as the bombs rain down on Syria and Iraq (again), it s worth
 bearing in mind that the president with the #LatteSalute is
 probably the least worst we can get without radical, systemic
 change of the entire American political system Whether the public persona is President Wimp or President Macho,
 it doesn t really make too much difference We get warmongering
 policies to keep Colonel Kilgore happy, whatever happens The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/190580-obama-coffee-military-operation-syria/
"27 Aug, 2014",Death & lies: The only truth of flight MH17,"The day Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 fell to Earth in pieces, everyone in our world was told Russia and Vladimir Putin murdered the 298 people aboard It is over a month since the biggest shoot down incident in air passenger history, and this is what we know for
 sure Whatever happened in the skies above eastern Ukraine on
 July 17, we ve been set on a reactionary course charted by either
 fools or the adjunct henchmen of some unseen game Did we risk the outbreak of World War III over hearsay and rumor?
 A mouthy leadership in the West has revealed the only real truth
 of this matter: credibility and trust was blown out of the
 sky over Ukraine At 1:15pm in the afternoon on July 17, 2014, the air traffic
 controllers at Kiev lost radar and voice contact with flight
 MH17 The Boeing 777 200ER, flying from Schiphol Airport in
 Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, fell in pieces on Ukraine s eastern
 frontier The earliest reports the public received on the catastrophe came
 from the various mainstream media Those outlets basically
 parroted what officials in Kiev and the US State Department
 released From the outset, officials in the West started a blame
 game, and one of massive proportions Within a few hours of the event, nearly all media reflected
 assurances that Russia, and the pro Russian fighters in eastern
 Ukraine were guilty We know now that almost all the initial
 information on the Malaysian Airlines downing was misleading at
 best Allegations, cooked up evidence from social media, and
 illogical theories took the place of news reporting for days on
 end US intelligence sources said sophisticated BUK
 surface to air missile systems were used to down the plane 
 Supposedly, these launchers were expertly operated by guerrilla
 fighters who were surrounded by Ukrainian security forces in
 contested territory Meanwhile, the same trillion dollar security
 and defense industry that the NSA spies on the world with,
 evidently showed MH17 was shot down by Vladimir Putin s
 Missile ù We were expected to believe Russia s president ordered his
 military to drive a BUK system across Russia s border, to deliver
 it to separatist forces there in order to shoot down a friendly
 aircraft, and then to drive the launcher back into Mother Russia 
 Moreover, this was all to be accomplished secretly, and in broad
 daylight through the most hotly contested real estate in Europe 
 Western leadership and once trusted media asked the world to be
 complete idiots, hapless peons ready for a Ukrainian shock
 and awe campaign But today we have a dozen plausible theories of what happened 
 The most legitimate at the moment, an air to air engagement by
 Ukrainian SU 25 attack aircraft, has been largely ignored even
 though key experts abide by the theory The
 Kiev/US/NATO/GCHQ/EU/White House narrative has quieted down
 somewhat now, since Russia s Defense Ministry sent the message
 that it had all the evidence But we re left with crippling
 counter sanctions here in Europe Sanctions levied on Russia
 based on a heap of lies, for all we know Where I come from there s a saying: the squeaky wheel gets
 the grease It s a good saying because it s true Well, the squeaky wheel in this tragedy reveals more malicious
 intent than we ve seen since the two great world wars Almost instantaneously the most powerful and vociferous US
 politicians leaped into action Major media from CNN and Fox to
 Reuters and the BBC followed suit, as if scripted US Secretary
 of State, John Kerry, for one, now appears as a hothead or irresponsible over early claims of knowing in a dire international incident It s
 interesting to note that Kerry has now faded into the background,
 left professing other truths about Gaza, Iraq and a resurgent
 need to strike in Syria Moments after MH17 went down, Kerry s State Department announced
 America s horror over the loss Then, just over four
 hours after the fact, Vice President Joe Biden proclaimed MH17
 had been blown out of the sky ùover pro Russia controlled ùeast Ukraine Reuters tweeted
 Biden s headline not five hours extant, provoking the question:
 How did Joe Biden know so soon? #BREAKING:
 U S Vice President Biden says Malaysia Airlines jet was shot
 down, not an accident, blown out of the sky î Reuters Top News (@Reuters)July
 17, 2014 Then presidential hopeful and former Secretary of State Hillary
 Clinton entered the fray, hot on the trail of truth, no doubt 
 Clinton appeared on the Charlie Rose Show the evening of the 17th
 to discuss MH17, pointing at Russia and observing stock prices 
 Any reasonable person might ask How was it even possible to
 discuss the event so soon? and Why was Clinton so
 focused on the stock ticker? The pieces of the Malaysian
 airliner, the bodies of the victims, had not even stopped
 smoldering Clinton pounded out the obvious concept that the
 equipment used had to have come from Russia ùShe further
 illustrates her total disdain of public understanding Any
 American child having been indoctrinated to know, Ukraine was
 once part of the USSR back in school Where else would their
 weaponry come from? Then we saw America s favorite State Department punching bag, Jen
 Psaki, come on two days later to assure us further that the
 administration was appalled by the insurgents who speak Russian limiting access ùto the crash site All this after OSCE
 monitors had begun investigating right after the disaster And
 all this misinformation at a moment when the Kiev junta had
 simultaneously launched a massive offensive right on top of the
 investigation zone? The media mirrored this, without even so much
 as an annotation that the separatists were being surrounded and
 bombarded relentlessly from the west We are deeply concerned by the Russia backed separatists 
 refusal to allow OSCE monitors safe and unfettered access to the
 crash site of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 Yesterday, the
 monitors were allowed only 75 minutes at the site Today, they
 were allowed less than three hours Thus far, the separatists
 have only allowed monitors to have limited access to a small
 area ù To add insult to injury, John Kerryspokewith CBS Face the Nation, and other
 major TV media the Sunday after MH17 crashed Again Russia was
 culpable Headlines from Kerry s MH17 campaign had the Secretary
 of State of the United States of America claiming Enormous
 amounts of evidence ùto show But we ve never seen any of it The New York Times, CNN and the mighty BBC were not the only
 media pounding out a message on their war drums in late July 
 Even a former tech blog turned world events tabloid spiked the
 punch for the Millennial Generation with Rebels Load MH17
 Victims Bodies Onto Train Cars, Destination
 Unknown Destination unknown? Really? As if Putin himself
 wanted to bury the bodies in Irkutsk It is significant to note here, one of the editors of the Kyiv
 Post contributes information and editorial to Mashable, the
 world s most read social media outlet But perhaps that s just
 another coincidence in this most recent high tide of coincidental truth What s more important for the
 public now are the results we are feeling because of MH17 s
 downing, and the subsequent blame game To wit, the greater
 catastrophe we have been led into Just a few days after those poor passengers on flight MH17
 perished, Washington sounded a bugle charge to the European Union
 to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia over that country s
 involvement Even though involvement had yet to be
 proven Soon afterward, Brussels complied with America s bidding 
 Russia and Putin, at long last, responded in kind Putin countered by banning agricultural products from Europe Now
 farmers and other businesses across the EU face almost certain
 ruin, the protests and cries for help, having already begun 
 What s even more potentially disastrous (especially for the US)
 is the probability the EU will come to its senses and retract the
 sanctions When this happens, the Germany US bond may well be
 broken, the likely replacement being Russia Insinuations of aggression by Russians, this has been the dogma
 of the Western leadership since before the Sochi Olympics 
 Vladimir Putin, considering the vehemence with which every
 Russian construct has been attacked this last year, has been
 unbelievably calm The West attacks Sochi and the Olympics  
 Putin puts on fantastic games The McCains and Kerrys of America
 incite riots in Maidan Square   Putin watches and informs The
 Russian language is brought down in Ukraine   Russian speakers
 beg for help Then Russia takes back Crimea in a bloodless
 annexation ì Washington and NATO use it, just like MH17, for
 another propaganda extravaganza Most notably though, even despite a chorus of sabers clinking
 from Washington, London, and Warsaw, Putin only countered with
 counter strategy, not tanks and massive military force, and that
 is defense , not offense , my friends Now
 it s safe to ask: Who is the real aggressor here? Today the headlines for MH17 read Briton killed when flight
 MH17 shot down over Ukraine identified or Remains of
 Irish MH17 victim formally identified , along with stories
 about Malaysian Airlines restructuring Barack Obama, David Cameron, Australia s Tony Abbott and the rest
 of those so sure for their right, now they ve gone completely
 silent Their theories and professions have literally
 disappeared, leaving us all either to accept their judgmental
 evangelisms at the start, or to forget about the perpetrators of
 the 21st century s most dangerous political catastrophe so far? How is this even possible? We have nationalized all the poor
 victims, boxed and shipped off all the bodies, while the souls of
 those killed linger aloft somewhere, killed by unknown
 assailants If transparency does not happen very soon, our belief
 in justice and truth will be the ultimate victim Somewhere in Spain today, a farmer sits pondering the eternal,
 the dilemma each of us has wrestled with at one time or another, What am I going to do? More appropriately though, what
 is the EU to do? We ve no need to regurgitate economic
 catastrophes from Portugal, Greece, Italy, Ireland, or to tell
 you about Romanian austerity horror stories here German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other EU leadership are
 reeling at this moment to steady a staggered confederation of
 nations Spanish farmersburningEU flags over harvested peach crops,
 the imagery of that pretty much says it all Sanctions levied on
 to a massive consumer nation like Russia, for no concrete reason,
 shows either a vast incompetency in the West, or an absolutely
 resolute posture toward conflict and chaos If Brussels does not come to its senses soon, hundreds of
 thousands more will lose their jobs in the next year ING Group
 just reported the potential cost from these sanctions might
 exceed 6 7 billion euro and cost 130,000 jobs, conservatively We are witnessing one of the biggest travesties of foreign policy
 ever perpetrated on Earth While some may argue I am being
 sensationalistic here, consider Hillary Clinton on TV minutes
 after a mass murder blaming Russia for the crime More than this,
 think of why she was consulting the stock ticker during her
 frenzied look to understand the tragedy, before anyone could have
 known what took MH17 out! Logic demands we ask: Or did they know? I mean, did
 the American administration really know who killed all
 those people? Days later we saw inside Russia s equivalent of the war room , evidence to the contrary presented by a
 professional soldier But somehow the report you see below in the
 video was not presented as a counterpoint, but as a propaganda
 piece by BBC, Reuters, and the others in the West Now we experience a humanitarian convoy, held up by Kiev with
 vital food and medicine for Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine,
 widely reported as an invasion by Putin We re asked
 to believe again, in trumped up allegations that the same Russia
 that rolled over the Blitzkrieg in World War II, the same Russia
 that made us duck and cover in the 1960s, the same
 Russia that struck fear into all Europe during the Cold War, that
 those Russian armed forces need to sneak into Ukraine in first
 aid trucks Excuse me, but this is something a lunatic would utter Just like
 some lunatics cried Russian wolf when the streets of
 Sochi were running over with wolves and gay haters, the second
 most powerful military in the history of Earth has to sneak
 past a broken Ukraine junta s forces? Like me, the reader
 should be laughing and crying at the prospect For me, judging Putin in all this brings me to one inextricable
 conclusion I wonder what the world expects from a great leader 
 I wonder what my fellow Americans envision a Russian politician
 needs to do to represent his or her people Is Ukraine not at
 least as Russian as it is anything else? And if parts
 of Ukraine are indeed Russian, what kind of man would leave his
 people to starve? To be slaughtered? What kind of Russia would
 stand by and watch NATO stick ballistic missiles 250 miles from
 Moscow? Since we ve more questions than answers since MH17 went down in a
 fireball, maybe the ultimate inquiry is introspective What kind
 of America supports lies and kills or destroys the lives of
 millions of people? The gravity of that question should compel us to demand the
 answers Not tomorrow, but today My fellow Americans would not
 cheat the world Phillip Butler for

"18 Aug, 2014",Why should UK taxpayers foot the bill for Ukrainian oligarchs‚Äô military adventures?," Back in 2003, with the illegal Iraq war looming and protests filling the streets of London in opposition, Vanity Fair s David Margolick came to Downing Street to interview Tony Blair Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv When the writer broached the topic of religion to US
 politicians what bees are to honey the former PM s spin doctor
 Alastair Campbell interjected sharply: We don t do
 God ùOf course, privately, Blair held a deep Catholic faith
 and never obscured it but there was a feeling among his advisors
 that in an increasingly secular Britain, spirituality was bad for
 business He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
 that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want ùKing James Bible, Proverbs 22:16 The current occupant of the office, David Cameron, has no such
 qualms This year he claimed he was doing God s work when he earlier launched the government s Big Society ùinitiative aimed at increasing volunteering and civic
 responsibility In a country where over 1 million people rely on
 charity food banks to eat and one in six children live in
 poverty, we can only wonder what God thinks of Mr Cameron s work This week the PM, who is valued at a comparably modest 4
 million, pledged 1 billion from UK taxpayers to the President of
 Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko worth the considerably higher figure
 of $1 3 billion Cameron is considered an aristocrat in Britain
 but his Ukrainian counterpart is known as an oligarch Poroshenko
 has amassed this fortune in a country with an average monthly
 salary which is 1/15th that of the UK However, the Ukrainian president is a mere pauper by comparison
 with the countries richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, who has somehow
 got his hands on $17 8 billion (according to Korrespondent net, a
 leading Ukrainian news portal) in the last two decades, or
 roughly 10 percent of the war torn state s entire GDP Akhmetov,
 who didn t make his cash running corner shops, is well known to
 the UK elite as the owner of the penthouse at 1, Hyde Park, in
 central London, paying a record 136 million for the privilege
 and another 60 million to decorate it The UK s richest man, Irish born Gerald Grosvenor, is no match
 for Akhmetov, but somehow makes do with a pot worth $11 4
 billion Grosvenor, also known as the 6th Duke of Westminster,
 certainly could not be described as nouveau riche his fortune
 dates back to the 19th century and was largely created by his
 ancestor Hugh, the first Duke Other, genuinely entrepreneurial
 Brits like Richard Branson ($4 6 billion) and James Dyson ($4 4
 billion) are in the ha penny place set side by side with the
 Donbass mogul The two Ukrainian oligarchs are not unique in their country,
 there are plenty of other billionaires knocking around Kiev and,
 in 2008, it was estimated that the top 50 controlled 85 percent
 of the nation s GDP Indeed, Forbes names nine Ukrainians on its
 tally of the world s richest people Ireland, with a total GDP
 that is 16 percent higher than Ukraine s, and with only 10
 percent of the population, has a mere 3 native born sons on the
 list which gives you some idea of the gap between the elite and
 the rest in Ukraine In Europe, we often talk about the one
 percent but in Kiev, it s more about the 0 000001 percent Ironically, should Poroshenko emerge victorious in his current
 military campaign against rebels in the Lugansk and Donetsk
 regions, the biggest economic winner would be Akhmetov, as most
 of his business interests are situated in that area Surely, this
 fantastically wealthy man could contribute the money the regime
 needs instead of Joe and Josephine Soap in the UK? After all, he
 has invested well over 1 billion in his Shakhtar Donetsk soccer
 project, but maybe he subscribes to Liverpool manager Bill
 Shankly s view: Some people think football is a matter of
 life and death I assure you, it s much more serious than
 that Last Spring, the Commons Defence Committee warned that due to
 government cutbacks there will be considerable doubt ùabout whether Britain will be able to defend itself in future 
 Amid cuts that will reduce the size of the British army to its
 smallest in centuries, Cameron has somehow found 1 billion to
 fund a war effort in a country that most of the UK s citizens
 know little about, nor would care much about if they did Given the corruption that pervades in Ukraine, it s highly likely
 that a lot of the money will find its way back to London s fancy
 restaurants and luxury good s stores rather than the war s
 front lines but that is beside the point Plainly, the UK state, which due to lack of money now has an
 infant mortality rate above the EU average, cannot afford this
 largesse and Ukraine s top 10 oligarchs which include its
 president can Throwing, say, $100 million each into a fund to
 assist the war effort in the east might mean buying a smaller
 yacht or moving to the less fashionable side of Hyde Park, but it
 would be a key step in showing that they are willing to change
 their ways in the new ùUkraine It would also be
 considerably more honorable than depriving British people of
 much needed cash for crumbling public services However, what if they have no intention of altering their
 behavior and they have instead hijacked the spirit of Maidan ùto simply replace one oligarchic clique with
 another? This seems increasingly to be the case with each passing
 day, as a glance at current political maneuverings shows The Maidan protests began as a show of people power, a large
 section of the populace tired of the gut wrenching corruption and
 the grind of life in Ukraine, which has the lowest worker s
 incomes in Europe Later, egged on by US and EU hawks, it was
 commandeered by paid protesters and far right activists before
 the billionaires took control of its momentum The latest Kiev
 soap opera concerns President Poroshenko s weakening grip on
 power as his Sergeant Bilko act in the east proves less effective
 than he d initially hoped Step forward Ihor Kolomoisky, who fancies himself as the new
 Poroshenko (who was the new Tymoshenko, who was the new repeat
 ad infinitum) Proud patriot Kolomoisky, a citizen of no less
 than three countries Cyprus, Israel and Ukraine has adroitly
 used his emergency appointment as governor of Dnepropetrovsk to
 position himself as a staunch advocate of Ukrainian nationalism He is also significantly richer than the incumbent, with $6 5
 billion on hand, according to Korrespondent Unlike most of his
 peers, Kolomoisky has also, Bond villain style, dipped into his
 humungous pockets to assist the military campaign with his own
 private militia numbering between 2,000 and 20,000 men,
 depending on who you believe Aside from bankrolling the Dnieper Battalion, he s also offered a
 $10,000 reward for each rebel captured by them and is hoping to
 found a political movement using his private soldiers as activists ùMeanwhile, Akhmetov is reportedly
 scrambling around in an attempt to launch a rebranded version of
 ousted President Viktor Yanukovich s Party of Regions which has
 its power base in the currently disconnected east An oligarch who has been quiet recently is Viktor Pinchuk In
 2010, Pinchuk spent more than $6 million on his 50th birthday in
 Courchevel, France Pinchuk, the son in law of former President
 Leonid Kuchma, is the founder of the Yalta European Strategy,
 which last autumn hosted former CIA director David Petraeus,
 Israeli President Shimon Peres, ex US President Bill Clinton and
 probable presidential candidate Hilary Clinton, plus the
 aforementioned Mr Blair Originally a supporter of Yanukovich, it
 appears that Pinchuk ($3 1 billion) is the oligarch with the most
 significant international connections, and has skillfully
 reoriented himself as a respectable face of Kiev business, ùdespite spending the annual net wage of over
 2,000 average Ukrainian workers on a birthday bash The question is, with all this cash swirling around Kiev, why do
 the Ukrainian oligarchs need 1 billion from embattled British
 taxpayers to fund their military adventures? With the NHS in
 turmoil, the armed forces being decimated and a sizeable minority
 in the UK unable to afford basic necessities like food, surely
 Cameron could find better uses for such a large dollop of dough?
 Or maybe he thinks that by presenting it to Ukraine, he is doing God s work ù? P S Russia also has problems with inequality and a culture of
 oligarchy This arose in the 90s after the economic shock
 therapy forced on it following the collapse of the USSR Despite
 the work of President Putin s administration to correct some of
 the wrongs of that period, inequality and a concentration of
 wealth remains a problem in Russia However, Russia cannot be
 compared to Ukraine due to its size, greater total wealth (over
 15 times more) and rather better distribution of it across
 society, albeit very far from perfect Nevertheless, this
 disparity remains an issue Russia must address and its lawmakers
 must do more to tackle it Many western countries also have
 growing problems with inequality and the United States is
 foremost in this regard I hope to address both Russia and the US

"19 Jul, 2014",‚ÄãIt was Putin‚Äôs missile?,"Here s the spin war verdict: the current Malaysian Airlines tragedy the second in four months is terrorism ù perpetrated by pro Russian separatists ù armed by Russia and Putin is the main culprit End of story Anyone who believes otherwise, shut up Why? Because the CIA said so Because Hillary We came, we saw, he died Clinton said so Because crazy Samantha R2P Power said so thundering at the UN, everything dulyprintedby the neo con infested Washington Post Because Anglo American corporate media from CNN to Fox (who tried to buy Time Warner, which owns CNN) said so Because the President of the United States (POTUS) said so And mostly because Kiev had vociferously said so in the first place Right off the bat they were all lined up the invariably hysterical reams of experts of the US intelligence community literally foaming at their palatial mouths at evil Russia and evil Putin; intel experts who could not identify a convoy of gleaming white Toyotas crossing the Iraqi desert to take Mosul And yet they have already sentenced; they don t need to look any further, instantly solving the MH17 riddle It doesn t matter that President Putin has stressed the MH17 tragedy must be investigated objectively And objectively certainly does not mean that fictional international community notion construed by Washington the usual congregation of pliable vassals/patsies A simplesearchreveals that MH17 was in fact diverted 200km north from the usual flight path taken by Malaysian Airlines in the previous days and plunged right in the middle of a war zone Why? What sort of communication had MH17 received from the Kiev air control tower? Kiev has been mute about it Yet the answer would be simple, had Kiev released the Air Traffic Control recording of the tower talking to flight MH17; Malaysia did it after flight MH370 disappeared forever It won t happen; SBU security confiscated it So much for getting an undoctored explanation as to why MH17 was off its path, and what the pilots saw and said before the explosion The Russian Defense Ministry, for its part, has confirmed that a Kiev controlled Buk anti aircraft missile battery was operational near the MH17 s crash Kiev has deployed several batteries of Buk surface to air missile systems with at least 27 launchers; these are all perfectly capable of bringing down jets flying at 33,000 ft Radiation from a battery s Kupol radar, deployed as part of a Buk M1 battery near Styla [a village some 30km south of Donetsk] was detected by the Russian military According to the ministry, the radar could be providing tracking information to another battery which was at a firing distance from MH17 s flight path The tracking radar range on the Buk system is a maximum of 50 miles (80km) MH17 was flying at 500mph So assuming the rebels had an operational Buk and did it, they would have had not more than five minutes to scan all the skies above, all possible altitudes, and then lock on By then they would have known that a cargo plane could not possibly be flying that high For evidence supporting the possibility of a false flag, checkhere And then there s the curiouser and curiouser story of Carlos, the Spanish air traffic controller working at Kiev s tower, who was following MH17 in real time For some Carlos is legit not a cipher; for others, he s never even worked in Ukraine Anyway he tweeted like mad His account not accidentally has been shut down and he has disappeared His friends are now desperately looking for him I managed to read all his tweets in Spanish when the account was still online And now copies and an English translation are available These are some of his crucial tweets: The B777 was escorted by 2 Ukrainian fighter jets minutes before disappearing from radar (5 48pm) ù If the Kiev authorities want to admit the truth 2 fighter jets were flying very close a few minutes before the incident but did not shoot down the airliner (5 54) ù As soon as the Malaysia Airlines B777 disappeared the Kiev military authority informed us of the shooting down How did they know? (6 00) ù Everything has been recorded on radar For those that don t believe it, it was taken down by Kiev; we know that here (in traffic control) and the military air traffic control know it too (7 14) ù The Ministry of the Interior did know that there were fighter aircraft in the area, but the Ministry of Defense didn t (7 15) ù The military confirm that it was Ukraine, but it is not known where the order came from (7 31) ù Carlos s assessment (a partial compilation of his tweets is collectedhere: the missile was fired by the Ukraine military under orders of the Ministry of Interior NOT the Ministry of Defense Security matters at the Ministry of the Interior happen to be under Andrey Paruby, who was closely working alongside US neo cons and Banderastan neo Nazis on Maidan Assuming Carlos is legit, the assessment makes sense The Ukrainian military are divided between Chocolate king [President Petro] Poroshenko who would like a d√©tente with Russia essentially to advance his shady business interests and St Yulia Tymoshenko, who s on the record advocating genocide of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine US neo cons and US military advisers ùon the ground are proverbially hedging their bets, supporting both the Poroshenko and Tymoshenko factions The key question remains, of course, cui bono? Only the terminally brain dead believe shooting a passenger jet benefits the federalists in eastern Ukraine, not to mention the Kremlin As for Kiev, they d have the means, the motive and the window of opportunity to pull it off especially after Kiev s militias have been effectively routed, and were in retreat, in the Donbass And this after Kiev remained dead set on attacking and bombing the population of eastern Ukraine even from above No wonder the federalists had to defend themselves And then there s the suspicious timing The MH17 tragedy happened two days after the BRICS announced an antidote to the IMF and the World Bank, bypassing the US dollar And just as Israel cautiously advances its new invasion/slow motion ethnic cleansing of Gaza Malaysia, by the way, is the seat of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission, which has found Israel guilty of crimes against humanity Washington, of course, does profit What the Empire of Chaos gets in this case is a ceasefire (so the disorganized, battered Kiev militias may be resupplied); the branding of eastern Ukrainians as de facto terrorists (as Kiev, Dick Cheney style, always wanted); and unlimited mud thrown over Russia and Putin in particular until Kingdom Come Not bad for a few minutes work As for NATO, that s Christmas in July From now on, it all depends on Russian intelligence They have been surveilling/tracking everything that happens in Ukraine 24/7 In the next 72 hours, after poring over a lot of tracking data, using telemetry, radar and satellite tracking, they will know which type of missile was launched, from where, and even produce communications from the battery that launched it And they will have access to forensic evidence Unlike Washington who already knows everything, with no evidence whatsoever (remember 9/11?) Moscow will take its time to know the basic journalistic facts of what, where, and who, and engage on proving the truth and/or disproving Washington s spin The historical record shows Washington simply won t release data if it points to a missile coming from its Kiev vassals The data may even point to a bomb planted on MH17, or mechanical failure although that s unlikely If this was a terrible mistake by the Novorossiya rebels, Moscow will have to reluctantly admit it If Kiev did it, the revelation will be instantaneous Anyway we already know the hysterical Western response, no matter what; Russia is to blame Putin is more than correct when he stressed this tragedy would not have happened if Poroshenko had agreed to extend a ceasefire, as Merkel, Hollande and Putin tried to convince him to do in late June At a minimum, Kiev is already guilty because they are responsible for safe passage of flights in the airspace they theoretically control But all that is already forgotten in the fog of war, tragedy and hype As for Washington s hysterical claims of credibility, I leave you with just one number: Iran Air 655 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT Editor s note:At the time of the column s publication, various media outlets were discussing reports about Carlos, an alleged Spanish air traffic controller, and his role in the MH17 crash Though the column s author uses only the subjunctive mood when talking about Carlos, RT considers it necessary to point out that the reports about this man turned out to be a hoax RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/174088-was-it-putin-missile/
"4 Jul, 2014","Ukraine, the country no one cared about","Ukraine is the land where time has stood still and the consequences of what has been sown are now being reaped as anarchy is unleashed upon its rotting corpse Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Just over a year ago, in rather more peaceful times, I was on a
 train from Kharkov to Simferopol, sharing a cabin with two
 Russian gents from the Far Eastern outpost of Nakhodka and,
 breaking the monotony of long distance rail commutation, we were
 musing about the differences between Ukraine and Russia My travelling companions were journeying to visit close family
 who they hadn t met before unusual to European ears but
 understandable when the distance between their home and Crimea is
 about the same as that between Paris and Chicago The two Russians spoke effervescently about the kinship between
 the nations and the fraternal ties but they did notice how
 decrepit and haggard the country looked by comparison with their
 homeland What have these guys being doing for twenty years?
 Even the escalator stairs in Kharkov train station was broken, I
 asked the woman at the station and she said it stopped working in
 1995 but they never bothered to fix it, the older of the
 two, Sasha, told me I had noticed the ornamental escalator myself but as
 I d been in Ukraine many times before I was able to explain to my
 companions that the same bedraggled appearance and function was
 general all over the nation, so it hadn t surprised me Russia in the 90 s, ùthey both exclaimed I had heard
 this before Ukraine is a place where time has stood still since
 1991 and basic services have been allowed to rot and decay while
 neighboring lands have made attempts to modernize In my view, this is the central reason that inspired the violent
 overthrow of the previous Ukrainian government at Maidan earlier
 this year It wasn t about the EU, the USA, Russia or NATO, it
 was prompted by frustration at 20 years of misrule by successive
 Ukrainian governments and by the Ukrainian people themselves who
 allowed it to happen As Bill Clinton s Presidential campaign
 mantra ed in the 90 s It s the economy, stupid ù Now, sadly, as a consequence of Maidan, the economic situation
 has disintegrated to an even more calamitous level and Ukraine
 has over taken Moldova to gain the dubious honor of
 being Europe s poorest state when measured in average monthly
 incomes This is due to the almost complete breakdown of civil
 society and the collapse of the hryvnia currency following the revolution which has wiped out what little wealth
 households held According to Kiev s own figures, the average monthly net wage is
 now a paltry 173 a month This is almost four times less than in
 neighboring Poland and nine times lower than in Moscow 
 Meanwhile, the richest Ukrainian, Rinat Akhmetov has a personal
 fortune of $12 6 billion according to Forbes and the new
 President Petro Poroshenko sits on $1 3 billion Is it any wonder
 a large section of the public have had enough? Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; Mere anarchy is
 loosed upon the world, the blood dimmed tide is loosed, and
 everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned; the best lack
 all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate
 intensity, so wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats in
 1919 in his seminal The Second Coming Basically, bungling ineptitude, graft across all sectors of
 Ukrainian society and a general we don t care attitude
 has reduced Ukrainians to penury while adjoining states have
 improved their living standards since Communism fell over twenty
 years ago some faster than others Of course, not all
 Ukrainians are poor, a small upper class has prospered since
 independence and continued to drive ever better cars on ever more
 battered roads and flaunt more expensive watches opposite
 worsening and grinding poverty This broken down Ukraine is visible all over the fractured
 nation If one enters via Lviv, the Western fulcrum of
 nationalism, you can see the horrendous sight of elderly people
 eating from rubbish bins all around the beautiful city center and
 power outages are a regular occurrence In the industrial
 heartland of Krivoy Rog, the city is so badly lit at night, due
 to either lack of money or will, that you need a torch to walk
 the central streets In the southern port city of Odessa, the
 pulchritudinous Russian built center is literally crumbling
 either because of indifference or a shortage of cash to maintain
 the myriad exquisite architectural marvels What most would charitably call roads are non existent in places
 and even the artery from Lviv to the Polish border at Medyka
 (which is a major trading route) is in such disrepair that a 90km
 journey takes about two hours Internal routes are in such a
 sorry state that many have the appearance that asteroids have hit
 them, but in reality are just afflicted by gigantic potholes that
 nobody has bothered to repair Corruption is widespread in Eastern Europe but Ukraine seems to
 be unique in that it permeates down to even the lowest levels of
 society It is present everywhere, from the usual suspects like
 traffic police and city officials right down to schools and
 pension rights even the child of Chernobyl cards
 were being bought and sold some years back to enable holders to
 benefit from freebies Driving licenses are mostly bought, not
 earned and it is practically impossible to graduate school or
 university without greasing a teacher s palm Considering students in Ukraine, generally, buy their Degrees and
 Diplomas, rather than earn them, it is doubtful that those who
 protested at Maidan were actually aware of what they are
 protesting for, and I am not joking Most seemed unable to
 distinguish a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (the
 association deal), from an offer for EU membership which is
 another matter entirely Many of the protestors (especially the
 students) were under a misconceived fantasy that they would
 suddenly be allowed to emigrate to or at least travel freely to
 the more prosperous West This is not the case and was never on
 the cards In fact, the only country that appears to be opening
 its borders to Ukrainians fleeing the current Civil War is Russia
 the EU frontier remains slammed shut Contrast Ukraine s decay with Russia s resurgence Since the
 arrival of President Putin for his first term in 1999, and
 through the Medvedev years, and into Putin s second
 coming Russian GNI per capita has increased more than
 tenfold, from $1,272 to $13,711 and Russia s share ofEurope s GNI has jumped from 1 9% to 9 8% (Source 
 Kushnirs, for the record) Meanwhile, in the first 21 years of Ukrainian independence
 (1991 2012, their GNI fell from 10 1% of theEastern
 Europeantotal to 5 3% and real incomes have been static or
 even declined The situation is certainly even worse now,
 post Maidan With this in mind, is it any wonder that Crimeans
 are so overjoyed to have been re united with Russia and that a
 large percentage of the citizenry of South Eastern Ukraine envy
 them and would also wish to join the Russian Federation? During my frequent travels to Ukraine in recent years, I have
 built up a network of friends and acquaintances across the
 troubled territory and all of them have complained to me
 copiously about the economic damage wrought by Maidan Even some
 Western Ukrainians, who enthusiastically supported the movement
 at first, have grown weary as reality bites and they realize that
 things have gotten worse and not better and that the EU is not
 going to allow them free movement in the foreseeable future Of
 course, many of them believe it is a price worth paying for what
 they perceive to be progress but even they are
 frightened of what IMF enforced austerity will bring Concurrently, the mood in the South and East is rather less
 optimistic most of them did not approve of the initial protests
 and even those who did have had enough as the upheaval passes the
 three quarter of a year mark Tatyana from Nikolaev, who I first met in Kiev in 2010, left the
 capital after her company folded and returned to her home city in
 the spring She is currently pondering whether to join the
 110,000 Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Russia this year 
 not because her life is in danger but because she foresees a
 better future in Russia and sees the current state of chaos as an
 opportunity to move I spoke with her on Skype and she told me
 her reasons It s sad for me to realize this, but Ukraine doesn t exist
 anymore The rulers of our country, they stuffed their pockets
 with money, when they were in power all of them! That s all
 they ever did and nothing more They looted and sold out the
 whole country and now they have split and quarreled and are
 playing their games on the people, the ordinary people like me
 and I have had enough, she told me My Mother has told
 me to run to Russia but I do not have family there I do not know
 what to do I am scared At the other side of the country in Lviv, my friend Nikola is
 also scared But for a different reason he s been called up to
 the military and is awaiting deployment Recently, he messaged me
 frequently asking for help to relocate to Ireland he s an
 extremely talented computer programmer and they are in huge
 demand in Dublin On a personal level, I owe Nik a favor as he
 was inordinately helpful to me in Lviv a few years back I told
 him I was writing this piece and he agreed to answer a few
 questions I am a Ukrainian, I love this country and I love the
 language and I love the culture My whole root is Western Ukraine
 and Lviv is my heart I stood on Maidan last year and I loved the
 movement but it has been hijacked Now I see that the Americans
 were playing us all along and that this was never about Europe
 and Europe was my dream To bring it here, to be a part of it, to
 be a European I am scared I am not a soldier and I don t want to fight I
 don t want to die for these politicians and I want to go back to
 my old work or escape I can be sent to the East to fight any day
 now and this is how I live in fear, he explained Nik added with genuine pain: The people in Donbas and
 Luhansk, they are Ukrainians like me and I don t want to kill
 them and I don t want to be killed by them either I want this to
 stop, to end Another acquaintance, Julia, from Odessa is out of work and
 barely scraping by she previous earned $700 a month as a
 translator for Marriage Tours (a not insignificant
 industry in the region) However, the hordes of (primarily)
 middle aged Americans and Brits have ceased coming due to the
 violence and the aspirant brides are lonely There is no
 work now at all I even tried the hotels, but they say foreign
 tourism to Odessa is gone this year and even the schools aren t
 hiring because nobody has money for English lessons most people
 can barely feed themselves, let alone work on their English
 vocabulary So many people are out of work What are they doing
 instead I ask? Many of them move to Russia and seek
 employment there, a small few went to Turkey to work without
 documents and the rest are just sitting on their sofas waiting
 for this madness to end When the delirious insanity does conclude and some measure of
 peace is restored to Ukraine and whether the South Eastern region
 eventually returns to Kiev s control or not, the scars will take
 years or even decades to heal There are the pockmarks of war, of
 course but the economic scabs will be harder to ameliorate once
 it s morning again in Ukraine and they awake from this
 long, dark night of the collective soul Ukraine has never been one nation in the way that
 other European states are, the fault lines have always been
 transparent But now that they have been opened and ruptured,
 it s doubtful they will readily repair In the economic sense, it is hard to see a great future for
 Ukraine The EU trade deal is only worth 490 million per annum ì
 by contrast, trade with Russia and Belarus is valued at 16
 billion annually ì and it is doubtful that Ukrainian goods will
 be able to compete on European markets in the first place Throw
 in the war damage to the already creaking infrastructure and the
 portents look very gloomy, not to mention the weariness of the
 population after the whole tumult What Ukraine needs now is not an EU association deal or an IMF
 austerity program; it s a Marshall Plan style aid package The EU
 is too preoccupied with troubled existing members like Greece to
 even contemplate such a move and the US, for all its big talk and
 promises, hasn t even so much as suggested such a move The only
 entity that might be willing and able to rescue Ukraine s economy is Russia (perhaps in partnership with China)
 but after the events of this year it s doubtful whether even

"25 Apr, 2014",‚ÄòPropaganda bullhorn‚Äô: John Kerry attacks RT during Ukraine address,"John Kerry has attacked RT for its coverage of the Ukraine crisis, calling it a propaganda bullhorn ù Neglecting to address the US role in the conflict or back up his assertions with any evidence, Kerry said Russia was behind the unrest in Ukraine During a press conference with the State Department on Thursday,
 Secretary of State John Kerry rounded on RT, lashing out at its
 Ukraine coverage The propaganda bullhorn that is the state sponsored RT
 program has been deployed to promote actually, RT network has
 been deployed to promote President Putin s fantasy about what is
 playing out on the ground, ùKerry said Furthermore, he said
 RT spends almost all its time propagandizing and distorting
 what is happening, or not happening, in Ukraine ù Dismissing the entire eastern Ukrainian, anti Maidan movement as
 being sponsored and controlled by Moscow, Kerry did not address
 allegations of American involvement in Ukraine Earlier this
 week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that America
 was running the show in Ukraine ùand referenced the
 visits to Kiev of CIA head John Brennan and Vice President Joe
 Biden LavrovdecriedJohn Kerry s latest comments about RT as uncivilized ùand prosecutorial ù [The West] was convinced for some time that it had a full
 monopoly on mass media, ùsaid Lavrov in a statement Russia Today has won a large audience in the US and Western
 Europe, not to mention in Latin America and the Arab world RT s Editor in Chief Margarita Simonyan responded to Kerry,
 saying the channel was preparing a letter seeking an apology from
 the State Department and asking for evidence to back up their
 assertions We are planning to write an official request to the State
 Department for concrete examples of when RT has distorted
 facts, ùsaid Simonyan It s unfortunate that the head
 of the State Department knows so little about what s going on in
 Ukraine at the moment It surprises me that at this difficult and embarrassing time
 for the US, Secretary of State John Kerry has nothing else to
 worry about apart from our television channel, ùSimonyan

 the US was losing a media war with up and coming, alternative
 outlets like Al Jazeera and RT We are in an information war and we are losing that
 war, ùsaid Clinton Previously, the US State Department had attacked Al Jazeera for
 broadcasting videos of Osama Bin Laden justifying the 9/11
 attacks They accused the channel of engaging in propaganda for
 terrorists and tried to get the emir of Qatar to shut it down Kerry s statements follow a flurry of anti Russian rhetoric from
 Washington and, when it comes to the facts, it s not the first

 of Kiev s anti terror operation which coincided with

 Crimea on March 17 that left two people dead Psaki cut Churkina

"13 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIs there a way out of Ukrainian crisis?,"Under the inept leadership of President Barack Obama and the bumbling diplomacy of Secretary of State John Kerry, the US is stumbling towards Cuban Missile Crisis redux It is the same Obama who promised to extricate America from two
 lost wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the same Kerry who in his
 youth protested against another lost war in Vietnam However, in a historical ironic twist it seems like both of them
 are now yielding to the enormous pressure from those whom Pat
 Buchanan calls the war party machine which includes some
 irresponsible politicians and the entire anti Russian cabal with
 its media surrogates In a rare case of bipartisanship, House
 Speaker John Boehner has called Russian President Vladimir Putin
 a thug, while potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
 compared him to Adolf Hitler I do not think the US leadership has used such inflammatory
 language even against Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi when
 America was getting ready for military action in Iraq and Libya Lost in this empty rhetoric is the sad fact that there are real
 neo Nazis involved in this drama, but they are not in the
 Kremlin They occupy a few important ministerial positions in the
 new government in Kiev and are among the Maidan leaders who are
 actually calling the shots US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland who gained
 instant celebrity status for using profane language while telling
 US ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt who should be included in
 the new Ukrainian government specifically insisted on keeping a
 radical extremist Oleg Tyagnibok and his far right Svoboda party
 out of the picture These guys could ruin the opposition s democratic face as they include those who have never
 disavowed various ugly anti Semitic pronouncements and openly
 admire Nazi collaborators such as the notorious terrorist Stepan
 Bandera However, it turns out that Tyagnibok s people have quite a few
 ministerial positions in the new government Still, all of them
 can be viewed as Massachusetts liberals when comparing to Dmitry
 Yarosh, the real muscle behind the illegitimate coup that
 overthrew Ukraine s constitutional government Yarosh has organized a paramilitary organization called Right
 Sector, based on recruiting hard core skinheads and far right
 nationalists, and arming them with pistols and machine guns 
 There is reliable information that his people got hold of Igla shoulder missiles, which are comparable to
 American made Stingers and can be used to hit both
 military and civilian aircraft Yarosh has been appointed to a
 key security position, and may turn out to be the real power
 behind the throne in Kiev He has already declared his intention
 to run for president and recently appealed to Chechen field
 commander Doku Umarov, who is on the US terrorist list, to join
 forces to fight Russia His associates are talking about creating
 a Ukrainian Taliban While Washington is coddling ultra nationalists with a radical
 anti Russian and potentially violent agenda, it is
 mischaracterizing the actions Russia has taken in Crimea People
 may like or dislike Putin, but even his harshest critics do not
 dispute the fact that the overwhelming majority of Crimean
 citizens want to join Russia This is understandable, since
 Crimea for more than 200 years was a part of Russia and was
 transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 by USSR Communist
 ruler Nikita Khrushchev, the same guy who almost got us into
 WWIII by installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, banged his shoe at
 the UN table and promised to bury America This extravagant gift
 was similar to the old time emperors gestures to please loyal
 vassals and make the Ukrainian people forget that it was he who
 administered Stalin s terror in Ukraine Does America want to go to war to preserve the legacy of this
 scoundrel? Not so long ago, Obama hailed the overthrow of Egypt s President
 Hosni Mubarak as an example of the power of human
 dignity ù There are very few moments in our lives where we have the
 privilege of witnessing history taking place, ùObama said This is one of those moments The people of Egypt have
 spoken and their voices have been heard ù Well, do the people of Crimea not deserve the same things as the
 people of Egypt, or for that matter of Kosovo, whose independence
 from Serbia was also supported by America? Under Obama, America is pursuing the same reckless and
 provocative policy towards Russia as George W Bush before him 
 After 9/11, Putin immediately called Bush and offered his
 country s full support, which was instrumental in defeating the
 Taliban, thus saving countless American soldiers lives during
 the Afghan War At the time almost all US politicians praised Putin and treated
 him as a hero, but when he suggested building on this cooperation
 by forming a political, economic and military Russia West
 alliance he was unceremoniously rebuffed Such an alliance would
 be an invaluable boost not only to our common struggle against
 global jihad, but to energy security, nuclear non proliferation
 and a million other things from agriculture to space research 
 Instead of embracing this sensible proposal, Washington scorned
 Putin s offer by launching instead a colorrevolution crusade
 across the former Soviet republics and promoting further NATO
 expansion, including within Georgia and Ukraine In the words of
 one of the most outstanding American diplomats, George Kennan,
 this policy was America s greatest blunder leading to the new
 Cold War Now, to further weaken Russia, the EU under Washington s
 direction, has invited six post Soviet countries to sign association agreements Had the EU been indeed
 interested in helping these countries it should have included
 Russia to this list, which would benefit all sides and most of
 all Ukraine which has strongest family, demographic, economic,
 religious and cultural ties with Russia But who cares about
 Ukrainians? They were just pawns in the West s geopolitical
 games Now Obama is getting ready to waste his time by inviting the
 current Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk for talks In
 the words of Forbes, Yats may prove to be arsenic to the
 beleaguered nation ùHe will follow the International
 Monetary Fund s Greek model austerity regime, which
 includes a regimen of tax increases, interest rate hikes and
 further currency devaluation For economists who think austerity
 is a disaster, Ukraine is on a path to ruin We saw this in the 90s and what the IMF did to Russia with
 Yeltsin They ll do that to Ukraine, ùsays Vladimir
 Signorelli, president of Bretton Woods Research LLC in New
 Jersey Remember Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in Yugoslavia? After the
 IMF finished with Yugoslavia it was only a matter of time before
 the separatist movements gained traction, ùhe said I
 think things in Ukraine can get really bad ù The smart thing for Obama to do would be not to meet the kamikaze
 Yats, as he might as well talk to his direct supervisor Victoria
 Nuland The wise course of action would be to dust off Putin s
 old proposal for a Russia West alliance and do some serious
 geopolitical strategizing with him, taking into account the
 modern global security threats However, to do that we would need someone in the White House with
 the vision of Ronald Reagan accompanied by the group of Wise Men Unfortunately, we do not see any chance for this to happen until
 at least the 2016 elections So for now, we can only pray that
 World War III can be avoided, despite the unprofessionalism and
 shortsightedness of the current foreign policy makers and pundits

"6 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãUkrainian overload,"Russian US relations have always been a fragile mix of rivalry and pragmatism As the Ukraine crisis highlight, bursts of cooperation achieved by resetting the relations are easily undone Can the two powers find common ground on Ukraine or will their relationship continue to overload ? Oksana is joined by Dr Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, to unravel these issues WATCH:https://www r tdotco m/shows/worlds apart oksana boyko/http://www youtube com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart With Russia and the United States at loggerheads once again, few would remember that this week marks the fifth anniversary of the reset ceremony during which Russian and American officials pledged to put their relationship on a new and more constructive footing Is the latest overcharge a direct consequence of that reset? Well, to discuss that I am now joined by Angela Stent, director of the Centre of Eurasian, Russian and East European studies at Georgetown University Dr Stent, thank you very much for taking part in the programme Angela Stent:Well, it is good to be on the programme OB:Well, here we are again facing one of the biggest crises in bilateral relationships, this time over Ukraine In your latest book The Limits of Partnership: US Russia relations in XXI century ù, you make a point that Russia has always be extremely sensitive about the West and the Unites States in particular, acting in its neighbourhood Now, we have never seen such a dramatic reaction from Russia before, and I wonder if this extraordinary reaction on the part of the Russian president, on the part of Russia, is also in a way a response to extraordinary actions on the part of the West and the United States in particular AS:Well, first of all let me just go back to the five years ago when Secretary Hilary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Lavrov She presented him the reset button which said reset in English and it said peregruska in Russian And of course, Mr Lavrov pointed out that that s the wrong word, that s the word for overload on English, it is perezagruska , and then I remember Kommersant had a headline the next day Clinton and Lavrov push the wrong button So in a sense this is relationship that has been overloaded There have been so many issues where we have disagreed, there have been other issues where we have worked together I see what s happened recently in Ukraine, obviously on a number of different levels What triggered it was the problems within Ukraine itself and the dissatisfaction of the people with their government, the failure to sign an agreement with the European Union as a symbol of that, but it goes much deeper than that OB:But isn t it also true that United States and the West and Russia, to some extent, were all too eager to exploit some of the disenchantment that the population, that the people of the Ukraine felt with their authorities, and when it comes to the West it is true that many people on Maidan were dissatisfied, but that doesn t mean that democratically elected government needed to be deposed, especially within a couple of months from the next elections AS:Well, I don t think anyone of the West foresaw that there was going to be, what was going to happen, in November I mean the EU was offering Ukraine a reasonable package, obviously not as much as President Putin and Russia offered Mr Yanukovych later on, but the United States wasn t really present The United States basically was allowing or wanted the Europeans to work out their deal with Ukraine The U S really only stepped in once all the demonstrations had begun and it was not very clear what was to happen Now I understand that the Russian media have portrayed this as a something supported by the US, by the Europeans and that these are fascist ù, but you know the situation there is much more complicated and this is not something that anyone in the West wanted to see a breakdown of governmental structures in Ukraine OB:Well, Dr Stent let me take an issue what you have just said about Russian media and their portrayal of the situation After everything we saw happening on Maidan, you know, a number of American officials showing out there with cookies and those intercepted phone conversations, it s really hard to believe that the United States was this impartial observer but, switching gears a little bit On Tuesday, President Putin made his first appearance before Russian media He held a news conference which gave him a chance to explain his rational and he was adamant that the Russia s actions were, represented a legitimate response to what he sees as illegitimate seizure of power Now, in addition to answering questions, he also posed one and let me play it for you I would like you to answer what he actually asked Cutaway President Putin: For me there s a big question, and neither I nor my colleagues can reply to it And you know I ve been discussing the Ukrainian crisis over the phone with a lot of our Western partners Why has this been done? OB:Dr Stent, you worked in the State Department, you understand how decision makers in Washington think What was the point, as far as American are concerned, of siding with this unconstitutional government, or endorsing this unconstitutional change of government because I mean elections are just around the corner and, you know, it is a still an open questions how long that government will stay in power AS:Well let me get you back to February 21st The agreement was signed between the various groups and the foreign ministers of Germany and other European countries and, of course, Mr Lukin was in the room, although he didn t sign it Then something happened, right? Yanukovych left, nobody s quite clear exactly how and why that happened, but that was not something that was instigated by any Western country So than you have to deal with the reality that Mr Yanukovych has disappeared, a couple of days Then of course he went to Russia And you have people in Kiev who say well, we re going to be the interim government I mean otherwise it would be a complete breakdown of all governmental structures, all law and order So, the U S and European countries are now dealing with this interim government, which of course wasn t elected by anyone, but otherwise there d be a power vacuum because Mr Yanukovych just disappeared OB:Well Dr Stent, Western powers may have nothing to do with Yanukovych disappearing, but they may have something to do with emboldening the protestors to the degree that they resorted to the use of force, because we know that some of the elements within the protest movement were armed They used force to occupy government buildings Mr Yanukovych in his latest press conference claimed that he was shot at by protestors, that his convoy was attacked So, do you think Western powers share some of the responsibility for the chaos that we saw on the streets of Ukraine by emboldening protestors, encouraging them to up the ante AS:Well, but you know, the shootings first of all, a lot of the shooting were also by trained snipers who were clearly not protestors but they were, you know, from some different government structures I mean, those units have now been disbanded The West had nothing to do with arming anyone in the Maidan and so, it doesn t bear responsible for the violence There s obviously a lot of different stories, but clearly there was violence on both sides But of the 80 people who died, most of them were the victims of government related forces who were trained snipers who were shooting them So again, I think, you know, one has to accept that there s an enormous amount of chaos there but the West not involved in any violence OB:Well, the West, again, certainly was involved in any violence but it sided with the protestors from the very beginning and that, again, may have created an impression that everything goes essentially Now, turning our attention to Russia s actions, which provoked a lot of controversy not only in West but also in Russia, this threat of using force to restore constitutional order in Ukraine Now, I m sure you know that Russia has a lot of equity in Ukraine, a lot at stake in Ukraine and I am talking about the Russian base there, the possibility for Ukraine joining NATO, not to mention extensive economic, cultural, historic ties between the two countries Now, given how much of that was threatened by this armed seizure of power and by the emergence of this far right government, the government that is clearly anti Russian, is it really surprising that Russia reacted in the way it did Did it have any other options of protecting its interests there? AS:Well, I think we have to be very careful So, I agree with you that this interim government immediately trying to pass legislation degrading the Russian language and its use in Ukraine, that was clearly a mistake, and they shouldn t have done it, and I guess that law is now no longer operative I mean, I could, I understand, obviously Russia does have very important equities, it has the Black Sea base Of course, it has a lease now until 2042 It s not clear to me that, I am not aware of any threats that were made in Kiev that somehow they would revise the issue of the basing of the Black Sea Fleet there No one raised that So the question is did Russia, in order to protect its equities there, did it need to have such a strong showing of force? I think that s the issue No one is questioning that Russia had the right to protect what it has in Crimea, but it s how it did it OB:But Dr Stent, what was Russia s other option? Because, in the beginning of this crisis, Russia clearly pursued a diplomatic round It was, you know, part of the negotiations that were taking place in Kiev, it was calling for a diplomatic solution and, you know, you don t need to take my word for it even some of the foreign diplomats, for example the Polish Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, who is hardly biased towards Russia, said that when the ousted president Viktor Yanukovych was negotiating a deal with the Opposition, that he reportedly received a call from Putin encouraging him to make concessions So, could it be also the case, that after trying to play nice and civil and abide by the rules, Moscow simply realised that this strategy was not only na√Øve, it was foolish? Because it essentially led to Russia, you know, potentially endangering all of its interests there, because the more concessions were made, the more the Opposition upped the ante AS:But there was no threat to the Black Sea Fleet or to Crimea ¶ OB:But how do you know? AS:From this very weak and fragile interim government I mean, it had only been in power, if that s the right way to describe it, for a few days So, I guess there s nothing that precipitated the need for this huge show of force The issue is, you know, what appears to be to many people, at least in the West let s say, a disproportionate use of force and a de facto occupation of Crimea OB:Dr Stent, you just mentioned that there was absolutely nothing that would let us think that this government was threatening in any way Russia s long term security interests, but you also mentioned that the first issue that this government, this interim government, preoccupied itself with, was the future of the Russian language in Ukraine and that s at a time when half of the country is in chaos So, that sort of show you the trajectory that government was prepared to take But the question I would like to pose to you obviously that measure was very controversial, I mean, it is still hotly debated within Russia, the idea of Russian troops being in Ukraine for whatever reason is highly painful for many Russian people, but leaving the moral aspect of that aside, isn t that also true that that proved highly effective as well, because, you now, after weeks and months trying to negotiate with the opposition and trying to persuade the opposition and the West to come to some sort of compromise, here Russia has everything it ever wanted I mean, the other day five former American ambassadors to Ukraine had an open letter published and they list pretty much everything Russia has requested so, we may not like this military option but it seems to be, it is highly effective AS:I agree with you, that obviously by using the military option, Russia has gained what it wanted, it s de facto Crimea will be a part of Russia, even if it is not technically part of the Russian Federation It s certainly not going to have the same relationship to the Ukrainian state You know, if Russia was wanted before to have Ukraine join the Eurasian Union, I can t see that happening for at least a very long time And clearly with all of the moves being announced by the United States and also by the European Union, it has cost Russia s something politically and it certainly cost Russia something economically I would say they are costs for Russia They may well be outweighed from the Kremlin s point of view by the gains, but this is not without costs as well OB:Well, I totally agree with you The only thing that I would add is that Vladimir Putin made it clear he is not interested in annexing Crimea I think it would be an extremely difficult undertaking for him to do, given the current circumstances But let s take the short brake now When we come back, is the Ukraine standoff a turning point in the US Russia relationship or rather, a point of no return That s coming up in the few moments on Worlds apart OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the stand off between Russia and the West over Ukraine with Angela Stent, director of the Centre for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University Dr Stent, this week marks the fifth anniversary of this famous reset, and in your book you make a point that every new American administration attempted to improve the bilateral ties but I think the feeling here in Moscow is that what Americans really mean by improving ties is essentially having a more complacent, less independent and less assertive Russia Is there any merit to that? AS:Well, I know that s definitely how many Russians see that And we ve obviously heard that from President Putin a number of times I don t believe that that was the intention in the beginning I would say that the reset of President Obama was a somewhat more realistic reset, and it s certainly did achieve quite a lot in President Obama s first term We can mention new START nuclear arms control agreement, cooperation with Russia on more sanctions on Iran, we can mention cooperation now in Afghanistan looking towards the withdrawal of forces there, Russian joining the WTO So, there were achievements there but I think the relationship became more complicated when Mr Putin announced his intention to return to the Kremlin because that reset was very much built on a personal relationship between President Obama and President Medvedev OB:Well, you mentioned some of the strategic achievements of the forth reset lead by President Obama, President Medvedev, partially President Putin And all those issues, they re dealing with strategic goals, with global security I wonder if all of that was worth putting on hold, which is most likely going to happen the next few months, probably years, for the sake of endorsing a pro Western government in one European country AS:Well, I would say that the relationship between the U S and Russia had really deteriorated even before these Ukrainian events, and I think from the U S point of view, the major event was the granting of political asylum to the NSA leaker and Edward Snowden This was something that the White House argued very strenuously against President Putin made the choice I understand why he did, from his point of view I am sure it was quite a rational choice So the relationship had been on a downward trajectory anyway But let me just say that despite all of that, the US and Russia continue, and will continue to work together on these global issues where they both have an interest, and where Russia is a very important partner OB:But, just of out of curiosity, I mean, you are renowned academic, you were in the State Department for a pretty long time and I know that this relationship, this partnership between Russia and the United States has always be pretty challenging and it was always limited But when American decision makers are considering their options, considering what position they should take in any given country, surely they take into account the sensibilities of their partners, and when you deal with Ukraine, I am sure they knew well in advance how sensitive that would be for Russia, and completely discounting Russia s interests, completely discounting Russia s fears in seeing some of those far right organisations, seeing some of those, you know, radical protestors taking part in those demonstrations, endorsing the unconstitutional change of government All of that, from the Russian point of view, it s simply very difficult to understand why would, you know, endorsing, you know this government be outweighing much more and much more important strategic issues that you mentioned earlier? AS:If indeed what we see in Ukraine as a result of all of this is Crimea in a similar status to say Transnistria or Abkhazia or South Ossetia, in other words, a region of a country where it functions as a quasi state itself and isn t under the control of the central government, and that really then makes the entire post Cold War order there, more fragile So, I think that partly has played into this Now, you could go back and say maybe it shouldn t have been cast as the European Union vs the Eurasian Union, but that s how it came to be cast And so I think the question is are we now seeing the break down of what we thought had been achieved in Europe after the end of the Cold war OB:Dr Sent, you just mentioned the issue of annexing or partitioning, annexing Crimea or partitioning Ukraine, giving Crimea some special status, and in your own book you describe Russia as a status quo power, and Russia was pretty content with the way things were going in Ukraine Whether there was a pro Western government of Victor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, whether there was the government of Victor Yanukovych, though I wouldn t describe it as pro Russian because I think Victor Yanukovich was really trying to, you know, play both sides of the isle, but Russia was pretty content with the status quo and what Russia was really defending was the status quo, whereas, in fact, it was the United States which decided to revision, in a way, what was happening in Ukraine and again with endorsing this unconstitutional change of government AS:Well then I think we d have to go into a discussion about what the status quo is Well I think from the Russian point of view, the status quo it wants to defend is a Ukraine that doesn t a) choose to go with the European Union and b) hopefully, from the Russian point of view, would join the Eurasian Union, or at least if not that, remain strictly neutral in a sense of not being in either of those economic bodies And I think both sides now, you know, understand that the status quo we had in Ukraine prior to, you know, February 21stdoesn t exist anymore OB:Now, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that there will be costs for Russia s military presence in Ukraine You also lauded to costs in the first of the part of the program, and what s interesting is that Vladimir Putin as well said today that if indeed there will be costs, there will affect not only Russia but also the United States How far do you think both administrations, both the Obama administration and the Putin administration are willing to go in punishing each other? AS:Well, I think there is a limit to how much they can punish each other First of all, in the US Russian case, we don t have much of an economic relationship, we re not like the Europeans, and therefore, you know, now I think our administration is talking about freezing the potential trade and investment treaty which we might have signed during the G8 summit And they re talking about, you know, not pushing ahead with some business deals we were supposed to have a delegation of Russian officials including the Energy Minister in Washington this week talking about energy deals So, you know, you can suspend those, but that doesn t, I don t think it imposes a huge cost on Russia, because as I say, we don t have much of an economic relationship So I think that the U S has limited leverage OB:Speaking about the costs, it is clear that a move like that certainly has reputational costs for Putin personally and for Russia as a country and, you know, invoking the use of force may be fine for the United States, it does it pretty regularly, but the thing is, it is an extraordinary thing for Russia both domestically and internationally, and I think it had, you know, the decision to even threaten the use of force was extremely difficult for the Russian president, and to that effect I want to play something that he said just before this recent crises broke out Let s listen Cutaway President Putin: The Olympics are very important for us, because I believe, and I would like it to be so, that the Games opened the door not only to Russia, but also to the Russian s soul, the hearts of our people Others could look and see that there s nothing to fear OB:Now he said that just a, you now, days before the events in Crimea, immediately after the Olympics and I wonder how do you reconcile the two his desire to show Russia as modern, welcoming nation on one hand, and on the other hand, giving orders that will clearly give plenty of ammunition to Russia s haters in the United States and in the West AS:Well, I ask myself the same question and so do many of my colleagues here, because, in fact, the Sochi Olympics were very successful I know that there was excessive criticism before the Games began in the West about a whole range of things, but you know, the evaluation of the Olympics at the end, was really pretty positive, including in, really, all of our media here The athletes had a very good experience So then the question is why, just so shortly after showing that Russia can host a very successful Olympic games, why then we have this militarily incursion and I mean, one can only say that, presumably, it was more important to do this militarily and to show, you know, the strong fist, than it was to continue this, you know, showing the face of Russia that everyone responded very positively to So in some sense, a lot of the good will that was built up in Sochi has now dissipated because of what s happened in Crimea OB:Well Dr Sent let s not overestimate the amount of good will that was created by the Olympics in the West I think that looking at the coverage in the Western media, it was pretty meagre, but what I want to add is that the fact of incursion is still highly disputed by Russia Russia does not recognise Western allegations of the incursion of its troops into the Ukrainian territory, but coming back to the sound bite that we just played, given how much Vladimir Putin was personally invested into the Olympics and how strongly he feels about, you know, showing the new face of Russia, doesn t it ultimately suggest that he was cornered? That the West essentially left him with no other options? Isn t that ultimately at the core of the question of why these resets never work that Russia is always sort of pushed into the corner, you know, it s interests are always betrayed or neglected when the United States or the West in general sees something of benefit for itself AS:I understand that that is how many Russians see the problem with the resets, that Russia s interests are betrayed And so I think the conclusion one draw from this is that, again, the U S and Russia have very different views of what drives the world and really how to evaluate the nature of the relationship Now I think that you can certainly criticise United States, and I do it in my book, for not spending enough time and effort to understand the Russian perspective, and understanding that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this was a very difficult period Russia is a great power and it has been defining its new role in the world And there should ve been more, you know, understanding of that But having said that, there s obviously clearly a very different view of when it s legitimate, for instance, to use militarily force in the situation as we have it in Ukraine OB:Well, Dr Stent, let me just, we ran out of time, but let me just say that no military force was used as of yet, you know Speaking of democracy, I think there is no other party whose interest would be served better than Russia by democracy being exercised because having the east and the south of Ukraine vote at elections would guarantee Russia s interest the best But unfortunately we have to leave it here Thank you very much for your time and to our viewers keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and hope to see you again, same place, same time, here on Worlds Apart RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/russian-us-relations-ukraine-114/
"30 Jan, 2014","US, EU meddling in Ukraine battle","In the heat of recent exchanges and deaths of protesters in Ukraine, many have lost sight of the insidious role key players in Washington and certain EU countries are playing William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com William Engdahl is an award winning geopolitical analyst and strategic risk consultant whose internationally best selling books have been translated into thirteen foreign languages He has lectured as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on subjects of current importance from economics to oil geopolitics to agribusiness A widely discussed analyst of current political and economic developments, his provocative articles and analyses have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and well known international websites He is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine Based in Frankfurt, Germany he may be reached via his websitewww williamengdahl com Their agenda seems to be to force an immediate end to the elected
 Yanukovich government in Kiev and lock Ukraine into the EU and,
 ultimately, NATO Washington s agenda has little to do with democracy and freedom , and a lot to do with
 destabilizing Putin s Russia On Sunday, January 19, the eight week long series of protests and
 demonstrations against the government of President Viktor
 Yanukovich in Kiev escalated to a new level of violence Bands of
 right wing militants called Pravy Sektor (Right Sector), attacked
 Ukrainian police guarding government buildings and attempting to
 contain the protesters Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at riot police from the top
 of the Dynamo Kiev football stadium in central Kiev beginning
 January 19 Police responded by using stun grenades and tear gas
 against the mobs Vehicles were torched by the hooligans from the
 neo Nazi Pravy Sektor More than 60 police were hospitalized from
 barrages of rocks, stones and Molotov cocktails The core of Pravy sektor is made of the activists of radical
 groups, including Trizub , Patriot of Ukraine ,as
 well as UNA UNSO and the Svoboda (Freedom) ultra right
 party, which won nearly 10 percent of votes at the last
 parliamentary election in Ukraine They are pro EU The far right violent radicals told Radio Free Europe, a US
 Government media agency tied to the CIA and State Department,
 that they were preparing full bloody guerrilla war against the
 government Andrey Tarasenko, Pravy Sektor s coordinator warned, If they attack and try to carry out a bloody crackdown, I
 think there will be a massacre Guerrilla warfare will begin in
 Ukraine Tarasenko stated that their demands ùare to oust the
 current government and build a nation state in
 Ukraine What kind of nation state we must imagine They also
 demand that Yanukovich step down, but, generously enough, add
 that they would give him and his family 24 hours to leave
 the country safely ù On their VKontakte (In Contact) social network website, the
 organization calls for donations of items such as slingshots,
 steel balls, gasoline, laser pointers, glass bottles, chains, and
 pyrotechnics Their published manifesto is nothing short of bizarre: All
 those who at this point would try to tame the revolutionary
 energy of the masses should be proclaimed traitors and punished
 in the most severe way The time of peaceful singing and dancing
 at Maidan [Independence Square] is over This is a waste of time 
 There can be no negotiations, no compromise with the ruling gang 
 We will carry high the fire of national revolution ù Curious is the fact that in the beginning of the protests, Pravy
 Sektor members were calling themselves the Maidan
 self defense force They had been designated by the main
 opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk and Oleg
 Tyagnibok to provide security for peaceful protesters Now they
 clearly have split from the peaceful protests Even more bizarre is the fact that in recent days ambassadors of
 several EU member states, as well as the US and Canada have gone
 to Maidan to meet Pravy Sektor activists and learn how the
 headquarters of national resistance operates Instead of unequivocally condemning the rise of violent Ukrainian
 nationalism, which could turn Ukraine into another Yugoslavia or
 Libya, the West is only threatening President Yanukovich with
 sanctions, while turning a blind eye to the real Pravy Sektor
 danger The Tarasenko demands are virtually the same as ex boxer turned
 right wing politician, Vitaly Klitschko, the pro EU apparent
 favorite of Germany s Merkel government Klitschko has lived in
 Germany for the past several years The nominal reason for the latest explosive protests in Ukraine
 was passage of a series of emergency laws to control the civil
 disorder by the Parliament on January 16 which, among other
 things, restrict the right to protest, constrain independent
 media, and inhibit the operation of NGOs Evidence suggests that key players in the Ukraine protest
 movement are being steered and orchestrated by Washington funded
 NGO s like the National Endowment for Democracy, the German
 Marshall Fund in The United States (a Washington think tank
 financed by a donation from the German Parliament), and certain
 key neo conservative Bush Cheney leftovers in senior positions at
 the State Department Already on October 11, 2011, the German Marshall Fund hosted
 Vitaly Klitschko, then WBC Heavyweight Boxing Champion just
 entering Ukraine s political boxing ring, at a Washington meeting
 to discuss Ukraine s European perspective Again in 2012 during the October Ukraine elections The German
 Marshall Fund in the United States hosted a top level group of
 UK, French and German journalists to visit Ukraine, where they
 also met Klitschko The Marshall Fund journalists were told by
 the US Embassy officials in Kiev that, Ukrainian oligarchs
 would like to see a strong opposition to the Party of Regions in
 the new parliament in order to temper the enrichment of President
 Yanukovich s family ù That strong opposition is today headed by three very
 different political parties One which won a shocking 10 percent
 in the last elections and sits in parliament is Svoboda, a
 neo fascist nationalist party led by Oleg Tyagnibok Tyagnibok
 backed the US financed 2004 orangerevolution He is openly
 anti Semitic and anti Russian, once claiming that Ukraine was
 ruled by a Moscow Jewish mafia ùThe second largest
 opposition party, jailed opposition figure, Yulia Tymoshenko s Fatherland , led by Arseny Yatsenyuk, has signed an
 agreement to work with the neo fascist Svoboda The opposition figure most attractive to the West is ex boxer
 Klitschko, head of UDAR (strike), the smallest opposition party,
 who has spent the last years living in Germany In order to have
 a chance at a Parliamentary majority in 2015, Klitschko will be
 forced to make a coalition with Svoboda and its policies, even
 though he is trying a delicate tightrope act of claiming to
 distance from Svoboda s anti Semitic ultra nationalism In an Op Ed in the London Financial Times, Klitschko wrote, the official halt in Ukraine s European integration unmasks
 the true face ùof the Yanukovich regime î a cartel of
 commercial self interests that has captured public office and
 believes that political longevity can be bought by selling
 Ukraine s interests ùUkrainians, he warned, would not allow
 Yanukovich and his cronies to steal their future ùand
 if their views were not taken into account, more protests
 are yet to come ù A central role in encouraging the Ukraine protesters is being
 played by the US State Department, and especially Victoria
 Nulland A review of the official statements from Nulland, who met
 personally with opposition leader Klitschko in early December, is
 instructive of the open interference of Washington in the
 internal affairs of Ukraine Nulland a Hillary Clinton
 appointee who now is assistant secretary of the Bureau of
 European and Eurasian Affairs in the State Department did not
 respect a sovereign decision by Ukraine s government in November
 2013 not to accept the dismal terms offered by Brussels for a
 Ukrainian EU Association status The EU offer would have forced Ukraine to open its
 economy to free market rules in return for little 
 When Yanukovich told the EU of his government s decision in
 November, Nulland s spokesperson issued the following statement: We continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian
 people to achieve a prosperous European democracy European
 integration is the surest course to economic growth and
 strengthening Ukraine s democracy ùThat was an undiplomatic
 intervention on the side of the protesters designed to embolden
 the opposition It did indeed Then on December 5 in Kiev, after her meeting with Vitaly
 Klitschko, Nulland declared, There should be no doubt about
 where the United States stands on this We stand with the people
 of Ukraine who see their future in Europe ¶ ù She followed her speech with a high profile bizarre media
 photo op where she carried a single plastic bag of food to give
 to the opposition demonstrators Nulland s partisan pro EU
 comments were followed by a brazen appearance from Republican
 war hawk Senator John McCain a few days later, siding with the
 opposition in December McCain is chairman of the Board of
 National Endowment for Democracy s International Republican
 Institute, which has been in the middle of all US Color
 Revolution destabilizations since 2000 Most recently, on January 15, after attacking Russia for granting
 a vital $15 billion bond purchase to help stabilize Ukraine,
 Nulland all but outlined the standard US government template for
 election tampering that has been done in countless color
 revolutions since the NED s 2000 coup against Yugoslavia s
 Milosevic She told the US Senate, the use of violence and acts of
 repression carried out by government security forces and their
 surrogates have compelled us to make clear publicly and privately
 to the government of Ukraine that we will consider a broad range
 of tools at our disposal if those in positions of authority in
 Ukraine employ or encourage violence against their own
 citizens ù Nulland then issued a direct order to President Yanukovich: We call on him to make it credible through concrete actions
 to restore government accountability, rule of law and engagement
 with Europe and the IMF ùThen, referencing planned 2015
 national Ukraine elections, she added, US pre election
 assistance to Ukraine likely will include programs to support
 citizen oversight of the campaign environment and the conduct of
 the elections, independent media coverage and informed civic
 awareness and participation ùAnd finally, The State
 Department and USAID are reviewing how best to support Ukrainian
 civil society and media ù USAID is widely cited as a cover for CIA operations in foreign
 countries Victoria Nulland herself is a former assistant to Vice President
 Dick Cheney, and married to neo conservative guru, Robert Kagan 
 She was under fire when caught recently lying to the American
 people when she was Hillary Clinton s State Department
 spokesperson Nulland pushed her superiors then to completely
 delete numerous references of extremists linked to Al Qaeda in
 Benghazi and eastern Libya after the assassination of the US
 Ambassador She also persuaded more senior officials to delete
 information on at least five other attacks against foreign
 interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants Washington is clearly out to destabilize the new Ukraine Russia
 economic cooperation by hook or crook On January 22, after
 severe Pravy Sektor violence, the American Embassy in Kiev
 announced it was revoking the visas of several unnamed Ukraine
 Government officials responsible for actions taken against
 protesters in November and December The latest negotiations between the Yanukovich government and the
 three main opposition party leaders îKlitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk
 and Oleg Tyagnibok îhave led to the resignation of Yanukovich s
 Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov and his cabinet, and changes in the
 emergency laws proposed 10 days earlier Nine out of 12
 anti protest laws passed January 16 were repealed At this point, whatever agenda Victoria Nulland s State
 Department may have had in trying to woo Ukraine away from
 Moscow, the internal forces of instability, egged on by vocal
 support from the West, have made the outcome incalculable That
 is certainly not in the true interest of the EU, having a
 critical Central European nation of 45 million ungovernable, and
 a rising nationalist fascist Svoboda led party calling the shots 
 That would prove too much even for the legendary boxing talent of
 Klitschko ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-eu-interference-in-ukraine-402/
"24 Aug, 2010",Ukraine marks 19 years of independence,"Major reforms in Ukraine are just beginning, President Viktor Yanukovich has said at a ceremony marking the country s 19th anniversary of independence, which is marked on August 24 The first steps we have taken are just a precondition for the start of systemic reforms The real work is just beginning, ùYanukovich said, speaking on Kiev s central square Maidan Nezalezhnosti † as quoted by Interfax agency The Ukrainian leader vowed that the reforms will cover all spheres of the country s life Their goal is to turn Ukraine into a democratic, developed and social state ù He stressed that he will not let the country stray from the path of democratic reforms for the benefit of a handful of selfish politicians ù Yanukovich has set three main tasks to be fulfilled in the near future: the humanization of society, modernization of economy and achieving European standards of living ù In his address to the nation, published by the presidential press service, Yanukovich set gaining economic independence as a key priority Now that we are entering the 20th year of independence, the government is doing everything it can to make Ukraine an economically independent state, because real independence is based precisely on that foundation, ù he said The program of reforms that Yanukovich is proposing is aimed exactly at making Ukraine an economically independent state, he added The Ukrainian President has also urged the adoption of a constitutional reform that would give him more powers and help to push through economic reform I see the renovated Ukraine as a state with a strong political system, and I am ready to offer the public such a formula, ùhe stated This formula ù would include a strong president who holds almost all of the levers of co ordination, control, the implementation of key reforms, and the country s strategic course ùThe parliament should be competent and politically structured † with a strong coalition and influential opposition The executive branch of power must be responsible, professional and free from any untouchable ministers and administration heads, ùhe stressed Finally, the president said that the country should have independent and fair courts which citizens can trust Such a political system should start working as soon as possible, he underlined Therefore, we should fundamentally improve the constitution ù As for Kiev s foreign relations, European integration remains at the core The president noted that now, for the first time since declaring independence, Ukraine has approached gaining associated membership in the European Union I believe that the Ukraine EU summit which is due to take place in autumn will become a defining step on this path, ùhe said The normalization of Kiev Moscow relations, he said, is no obstacle for Ukraine s European integration On the contrary, it furthers the process United Europe needs an economically strong Ukraine which, together with Russia, contributes to strengthening stability, ùYanukovich added In his greeting message to Ukraine, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has specifically noted both countries intention to a constructive resolution of all issues based on the principles of equality and respect of each other s interests Prior to the presidential election, Yanukovich had been seen as rather a pro Russian candidate, as opposed to his West leaning predecessor Viktor Yushchenko, who was seeking NATO membership, a policy which brought relations with Moscow to its lowest point since the collapse of the USSR Since the very beginning of his term in office in February this year, Yanukovich has been striving for balanced relations with both the West and its former Soviet republic neighbors Yanukovich has also managed to build a rapport with Washington In April, during his first face to face meeting with Barack Obama on the sidelines of the US nuclear summit, Yanukovich announced Ukraine s intention to give up its stock of highly enriched uranium by the summer of 2012 The move was very much welcomed by Washington, who, in return, offered technical and financial help to Kiev Ukraine brought a bilateral dialogue with the United States to a higher level and disposed of highly enriched uranium, Yanukovich said on Tuesday, writes Itar Tass We not only supported our partner s initiative, we also made another convincing contribution to the creation of nuclear free world Congratulating Ukraine on its Independence Day, US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton assured that Washington is proud to be your partner ù and vowed that the US will continue to support Kiev in its work to achieve the full benefits of democracy and all of the blessings that go with it ù You honor the democratic values that not only Ukrainians, but also Americans, share, ùshe said in a statement On August 24, 1991, the Verkhovna Rada † the parliament of the then Soviet Republic † adopted the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine To reaffirm the act, a referendum was held in Ukraine on December 1, 1991 Over 90 per cent of the republic s population supported the idea of Ukraine being an independent state and leaving the USSR While for politicians, Independence Day is yet another chance to show off, the Ukrainian public is enjoying a day off and festive events that have been organized throughout the country It is planned that up to 800,000 people will take part in celebrations which will end with fireworks in the evening
