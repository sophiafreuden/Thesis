"10 Oct, 2019",Who are Extinction Rebellion ‚Äî the ‚Äòeco-activists‚Äô grounding planes & shutting down cities,"Calling for civil disobedience in the face of climate change, Extinction Rebellion protesters have been remarkably successful in thrusting themselves into the headlines But what is the movement all about? And who s behind it? Best known for shutting down the streets of London in April, Extinction Rebellion upped its game on Thursday, with a protester affiliated with the group grounding an Aer Lingus flight from London City Airport to Dublin Another protester Paralympian James Brown clambered onto the roof of a British Airways plane and refused to budge, prompting police to eventually remove him Just about to take from London city airport Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protestor #londoncityairport#ClimateChangepic twitter com/eWBeeUiGHM The disruptions came as Extinction Rebellion threatened a Hong Kong style ùoccupation and shutdown of the airport, and as similar protests hit more than 60 cities worldwide Ultimately, it is part of Extinction Rebellion s aim to get people arrested, ùread a flyer circulated by activists in Dublin To that end, the group has been successful More than 1,000 activists have been arrested in London alone this week, including 50 at London City Airport The group sdemandsare threefold First, they call on governments to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, ùa similar demand to that made by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York last month A seemingly benign demand, but one that paints opponents as anti truth Secondly, they demand that government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 ùFinally, the group demands that government partner up with activists, and create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens Assembly on climate and ecological justice ù While a Citizens Assembly would draw on a cross section of society, it would be government created and guided by a collection of NGOs and academics, as was the case in Ireland when the government convened such an assembly to pave the way for referenda on gay marriage and abortion in recent years Extinction Rebellion make no mention on whether NGOs with opposing views will be included in the deliberation At XR s rallies, protesters have called for any number of ways of meeting these goals and more, including government bans on meat and private cars, abolishment of the airplane, boycotts of the fashion industry, and disbandment of the military Disrupting commerce is fair game for making their points, as is disrupting vital services As a cancer patient in London was forced towalkto hospital treatment due to XR s roadblocks, spokesperson Savannah Lovelock told Sky News that while she was really sorry, ùsuch action is necessary for the good of the planet Central to all of the group s demands is a radical expansion of state power Reducing greenhouse gases to net zero if a state led effort would give government the power to restrict or outright deny its citizens freedom of travel, freedom to choose their own diets, and freedom to build their homes however they want In the US,drafttextof Green New Deal legislation gives a sneak peek at just how all encompassing this would be, working wealth redistribution and reparations for historic oppression ùinto the mix for good measure A potent illustration of the group s appeal to authority came last November, when XR co founder Gail Bradbrook marched on Buckingham Palace and read aloud amessageto Queen Elizabeth with great humility, ùcalling on the monarch to save the planet by royal decree It isn t enough to live a life of voluntary simplicity, ùacademic and XR campaigner Rupert Read wrote at the time The implied meaning is clear: people will have to be coerced into complying Here s where things get interesting Exploding onto the scene with a recognizable logo, coherent imagery across multiple continents, a dominant social media presence and a slick website, the leaders of Extinction Rebellion are no rabble of bong smoking malcontents Especially not Dr Gail Bradbrook The co founder of the movement told the BBC that she came up with the idea after praying in a deep way ùwhile under the influence of psychedelic medicines ùon a retreat last year In truth, Bradbrook has made a career out of activism, and has for two decades worked as a professional campaigner Speaking at a talk in 2016, sheadmittedthat this role is mostly about securing your own paycheck ùAs director of Citizens Online a charity campaigning for digital inclusion, ùBradbrook has worked with BT to lobby the British government Joining Bradshaw are former organic farmer Roger Hallam, and also involved are Occupy London veteran Tasmin Osmond a granddaughter of British nobility and ex UN worker Laura Reeves Behind the movement is a bulwark of elite cash Heiress Aileen Getty has kicked in nearly 500,000 of her family s oil wealth to the group via the Climate Emergency Fund, claiming that disruption ùis necessary to take on climate change According to its own data, Extinction Rebellion has raised just short of a million pounds in largedonationssince March, from groups like the Children s Investment Fund Foundation, set up by a hedge fund manager and run by a former vice chairman of billionaire financier George Soros Open Society Institute Aside from annoying motorists and boosting superglue sales, Extinction Rebellion has achieved some of its aims Eleven countries and dependencies, beginning with Britain and Ireland, have declared a state of climate emergency, ùeven if Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar did say afterwards that the declaration was a symbolic gesture ù What Extinction Rebellion has also been successful in is pandering to the wishes of global financiers and the new captains of green industry The group s call for net zero ùcarbon emissions is echoed by the World Bank, and a host ofinvestment firms, including HSBC, JP Morgan Chase and Citi, that see profits to be had ùin climate related sectors ù None of this is a bad thing on the surface, except that these groups which have banded together to form the Climate Finance Partnership and Blended Finance Action Taskforce want access to taxpayer money and pension funds to do this This Western money, according to the groups, will be funnelled into projects in Africa, Asia, and South America Rarely do the demands of activists and the will of international finance line up, but not everyone is happy In London, Police Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has warned that the current protests will hamper officers ability to tackle street based violence, ùand leave the city more vulnerable to terrorism Street blockages and airport disruptions may put Extinction Rebellion at odds with the majority of the population, but majority support is unnecessary XR co founder Roger Hallam has repeatedlyreferencedGene Sharp as an inspiration An American political scientist, Sharp s theory of nonviolent action that only 3 5 percent of a population need to back a protest movement before it reaches critical mass and triggers change has been adopted and put into practice by color revolutionaries around the world, from US sponsored student protesters inSerbiaat the turn of the century, to Arab Spring revolutionaries more recently Celebrities have lined up to endorse Extinction Rebellion from gloom rockers Radiohead chipping in 300,000 to Benedict Cumberbatch joining protesters camped in Trafalgar Square With elite cash and backing, as well as round the clock media coverage, Extinction Rebellion is well on its way to Sharp s tipping point, and has well and truly glued itself to the public consciousness already Think your friends would be interested?

"24 May, 2019",West-backed think tanks threaten new Ukrainian president with disturbing list of ‚ÄòRED LINES‚Äô,"When President Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide victory in the free and undisputed April elections, most accepted that he was given a fairly strong mandate to lead Ukraine But it seems not everyone is so democratically minded Particularly unmoved by the democratic process are a collection of Ukrainian civilsociety groups, who have just issued alengthy listof red lines not to be crossed ùby the new president, lest he risk provoking a new wave of political instability that they would presumably instigate Issuing their catalog of demands on Thursday, the groups claim to be politically neutral ùbut deeply concerned ùabout the first actions taken by the comedian turned politician Zelensky, including his decision to appoint members of former President Viktor Yanukovych s government to positions within his own government Various civilsociety groups in#Ukrainehave issued a list of red lines that they don t want president@ZelenskyyUato cross, saying there ll be unrest if he does It s the longest list of red lines I ve ever seen Twittosphere, what do you make of it?https:// tdotco /jgHAIIAciS A scan of the undersigned reveals that many of these civilsociety groups ùare anything but politically neutral In fact, quite a few of them are partly funded by the US government, various EU governments (including the UK), the European Commission itself and, of course, the omnipresent liberal billionaire George Soros The list includes the notorious Euromaidan Press, Stop Fake and Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, to name just a few In their heyday, many of these groups acted as propaganda tools of the Western backed government of Petro Poroshenko, rather than the watchdogs they claim to be They now confirm that a pesky election isn t going to stand in the way of their agenda, reaffirming that their own principles and positions ùon issues remain unchanged and warning: Should [Zelensky] cross these red lines, such actions will inevitably lead to political instability in our country This statement, which precedes the wide ranging list of red lines, reads like a threat: Do what we say, or there will be trouble Isn t that a strange, almost dictatorial approach for groups purporting to be interested in democracy, freedom, and dignity ù?Did we all miss the part where a group of think tanks were collectively elected president of Ukraine? This list of demands by western funded Ukraine NGOs îthreatening to overthrow Zelenskiy if he doesn t follow their demands îperfect example of Arundhati Roy s critique of civilsociety as an elite construct designed to subvert & control popular democracyhttps:// tdotco /j33iGoSqOA Of course, these groups do indeed represent various factions of Ukrainian society and many of them no doubt have worthy aims, and they should continue their work unimpeded But they do not represent all of Ukrainian society and they certainly do not have the authority to set the political agenda and lay down the law to the incoming government and that, quite literally, is what they are trying to do It s such a gobsmackingly odd list of demands that even Western journalists who had a broadly friendly relationship with the Poroshenko government are aghast at their audacity The list is broken down into issues of security, foreign policy, economy, national identity (language, education and culture), media and government functioning On security, the groups want to forbid Zelensky from achieving compromise with Russia in any manner that would be to the detriment of the national interest, presumably as defined by themselves Inhibiting the implementation of security and defense policies outlined in a 2016 decree signed by Poroshenko is also forbidden, they say do these cronies not know how democracy works, or just not care? Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda they don t get to continue setting it like the election never happened In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the reduction or lifting of sanctions on Russia by Western powers He may not take any action delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with the IMF and other foreign partners It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review ù multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious de communization ù which banned Soviet symbols in the country Ironically, this push for de communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy The NGOs ùinsist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another red line among their national identity demands Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian? Well, Zelensky will also be in big trouble if he tries to restore them, the civilsociety groups ùsay READ MORE: Reality bites: Ukraine s President Zelensky puts showbiz pals in positions of real power The most vague red line of all comes near the end of the list, when the new president is warned against ignoring dialogue with civilsociety ù a command so vague that almost anything ùZelensky does going forward could be interpreted as ignoring their wishes, France 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg wrote on Twitter BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher tweeted that the groups themselves may have crossed a red line †the red line of what civilsociety groups can legitimately demand of a freshly elected government I feel like almost anything he does could be interpreted as crossing one or other of those lines, they re so wide ranging It reads like a manifesto there s an election in 2 months Make a party see if anyone agrees with you that s democracy Zelensky was elected to office with 73 percent of the vote and let s not forget, he won that election having campaigned against many of the policies these civilsociety groups are aggressively demanding be kept in place He has been in office only a matter of days, and these Western backed groups are threatening to instigate political unrest should he take any action that they don t find acceptable to their political agenda So who, exactly, poses the real threat to democracy?

"9 May, 2019","Danish right-wingers recruit controversial candidates, as country gets ready for elections","The rise of the right wing in Europe may be a tired cliche at this point However, a new Danish party has courted fresh controversy for hiring some distinctly un PC candidates, as the country goes to the polls next month Stram Kurs (Hard Line) will run for election for the first time in June The party pushes a combined message of small government libertarianism and ethnonationalist utilitarianism ùThe latter translates as a ban on Islam, an immediate withdrawal from refugee conventions, and the deportation of all asylum seekers and any non western persons ù The party also favors a crackdown on Danes who help alien enemies undermine Denmark, ùpresumably charities and NGOs Hungary s Viktor Orban spearheaded a similar crackdown with his Stop Soros Act last year Party leader Rasmus Paludan has drawn attention to himself with a number of high profile stunts, like leading protest marches through Muslim ghettos, burning copies of the Koran, and encouraging his followers to draw pictures of the prophet Mohammed Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Ramussen has condemned Paludan s publicity stunts as meaningless provocations ù Although anti immigration and nationalist parties have gained ground in nearly 20 European countries since the beginning of the refugee crisis in 2015, no mainstream organizations have dared call themselves ethnonationalist ùPerhaps the closest mainstream analog to Stram Kurs is Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders Partij voor Vrijheid (Party for Freedom or PVV) Like Stram Kurs, the PVV s policies focus almost entirely on the de Islamization ùof the Netherlands, coupled with a smattering of small government and tax cutting initiatives Like Wilders, Paludan has faced legal consequences for his speech, having been handed a 14 day jail sentence in April for alleged racism towards a spokeswoman for the Black Lives Matter movement Unlike Stram Kurs, the PVV has been a viable opposition party in the Dutch parliament for over a decade, and is currently the second largest party in the Netherlands Stram Kurs, meanwhile, ispollingat just over two percent, beating only the country s Christian Democrats and businessman Klaus Risk√¶r Pedersen s self titled party Still, the party has punched above its weight when it comes to grabbing newspaper headlines On Wednesday, Paludan announced that 81 year old professor Helmuth Nyborg will stand for election with Stram Kurs Paludan said that Nyborg is an internationally highly respected researcher ùon IQ and cognitive ability Opponents say Nyborg s †opinions on racial IQ differences are abhorrent It goes without saying that if many people come to Denmark from countries where the inhabitants have a lower intelligence quotient, then over time we get a lower average intelligence quotient, ùhe told the Jyllands Posten newspaper in 2010 Modern Finnish research shows countries with an IQ averaging less than 90 fail to create or maintain democracy This explains why any attempt to bring democracy to countries with low IQ are doomed to failure We can learn from Libya, Afghanistan & Iraq writes Helmuth Nyborg Nyborg s views and scientific background lend weight to an argument Paludan has made since he entered politics in 2017 The average in IQ in Somalians is much lower than in us, ùPaludan told Ekstra Bladet last year It does not make them subordinates that on average they have poorer brains than Danes There is just a difference between races and there is no need to lie about it There are many from Africa who do not understand very much because their IQ is 80 ù Nyborg s views are controversial, and the professor is currently facing academic discipline for a 2013 paper setting out those views entitled The Decay of Western Civilization However, African and Middle Eastern countries have been ranked at thebottomof IQ tables, and some researchers have pinned thedifferenceon race and genetics, albeit under intense criticism How receptive is Denmark to an open ethnonationalist party that embraces controversial figures like Professor Nyborg? The answer is probably somewhat Unlike its uber liberal neighbor Sweden, Denmark has reacted to the influx of refugees and migrants with increasing hostility The coalition government made up of the center right Venstre and further right Danish People s Party has passed laws requiring refugees to hand over jewelry and valuables to finance their stay, banned the burqa in public, and planned to ship rejected asylum seekers to an uninhabited island in the Baltic sea If you are unwanted in Danish society, you should not be a nuisance to ordinary Danes, ù Immigration Minister Inger St√∏jberg stated when announcing the island plan They are undesirable in Denmark and they must feel it! ù St√∏jberg has been a key author of her government s anti immigration policies In March 2018, she marked the passing of her 50th anti immigration measure by celebrating with a cake decorated with fruit, the Danish flag, and the number 50 #DanishMinister for#Integration(!) Inger#St√∏jbergis celebrating her 50th tightening of#immigrationrules #classy#trumpingtrumppic twitter com/fD8sTRFUpU The government has also targeted settled immigrants, who it says often live in parallel societies ùLast July, as part of a series of measures aimed at eradicating immigrant ghettos, the government announced tougher criminal penalties, lower benefits, and mandatory integration classes for those living in these neighborhoods Despite the anti immigrant sentiment coming from the Danish government, voters are not so sure The center left Social Democrats are leading in the polls at 25 percent, compared to Venstre s 20 percent and the Danish People s Party s 11 6 percent The Social Democrats have begun to move further right on immigration, and as a result could have plenty of coalition forming opportunities open with the center and center right parties As long as Stram Kurs manage to capture more than two percent of the vote, the party looks set to enter parliament for the first time next month In the runup to the election, the newcomers could push the existing right wing even further right as nationalist party Vox did in Spain recently or siphon the hardline vote away from the Danish People s Party Such a fragmentation of the right was also seen in Spain last month, and ultimately helped left wing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez party consolidate its power in parliament Meanwhile, Paludan and Stram Kurs continue to grab column inches The party also took on board as a candidate a prison guard who Paludan said can offer professional knowledge of the consequences of immigration ù As Paludan builds his anti immigration dream team, next month s elections will reveal whether the Danish electorate still wants to continue the country s rightward shift Asylum applications in Denmark dropped by 84 percent between 2015 and 2018, and without a cohort of immigrants to rail against, a return to centrism is not unlikely Think your friends would be interested?

"13 Feb, 2019",Revolution is the new black: How Western money funds overthrow-your-government classes,"Everyone at this gathering in Yerevan is young, hip and determined, and they re learning how to stage a revolution RT Russian managed to get inside the protesters camp, funded by US cash, and see what is being taught The Camp–°amp 2018 forum in Yerevan was sponsored by the Prague civilsociety Centre, an organization financed by the United States under the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) Section 254 of the Act allocated $250,000 for activities to counter Russian influence ùin 2018 and 2019 Capitol Hill lawmakers seem to believe that this Russian influence ùis a threat to all NATO s actual and potential members, including Georgia, Moldova, Kosovo, Serbia, and Ukraine The Yerevan gathering is proving that the State Department s money is doing its job all right Protest lobbying spin doctors have been putting the money to good use dragging more and more people into their skillfully woven web And it s no coincidence Armenia was chosen to host the camp After large scale protests forced Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan to resign, protesters from all over the Commonwealth of Independent States started flocking to Yerevan for more inspiration A total of 150 people participated in the forum; most were sponsored by the organizers from Prague Local participants were hailed as heroes, and visiting young men and women from other ex Soviet republics got their own injection of inspiration from their triumph If Armenia could, they can, too The focus in CampCamp is on new technologies, on all things young and hip Fighting the authorities must be the cool thing to do, it must be trendy, ùteaches Nikolay Artyomenko, head of the opposition Vremya (Time) movement from St Petersburg His portfolio is quite impressive He put up banners on St Isaac s Cathedral protesting against the Orthodox Church taking over the museum He ran a copy of the country s constitution through a shredder, Banksy style, co organized anti corruption protests with rubber ducks; distributed Dictator ùprints where Putin was depicted like Obama in his Hope ùposters Nikolay teaches others to be creative and invent new ways to protest that should take over the old school crowd with picket signs format You have to stretch your imagination; there s quite a problem on the protesting market these days Protesting has become very expensive ù,he shares But Zhenya, an activist from Siberia, knows how to cut costs He just turned 18, yet he has already risen to stardom on the activist scene: his one man protests have made front page headlines in his city more than once Each of Zhenya s demonstrations is like a theatrical performance He carefully selects props and plans according to the country s Administrative Penal Code: You have to make sure you violate different laws to avoid being double fined ù He s locked in a long debate with Sasha from St Petersburg about what kind of a public protest will get the smallest fine, and how to cut the expenses ù Sasha is the more experienced of the two: he is already a law student and knows how to protest with minimal charges This is yet another important factor in making protesting popular Protests should not be seen as something heroic that one pays too high a price for Just slap a poster on a wall here and there, upload a stinging meme or at most join a protesting crowd, take a selfie in the police van, pay your fine and go home In today s world of social media, absolutely anyone can be a reporter, an expert, a critic or a TV journalist so why not be a revolutionary? It is easy to get a grant; you can spend a month in the Czech Republic or work at Radio Free Europe or some think tank ù,Michael Zolyan tells Polina from Omsk Michael is the frontman of the Velvet Revolution ù,according to the organizers By coincidence, he is also a Prague civilsociety Centre expert The CampCamp 2018 s most active group is the one from Kyrgyzstan It s a crowd of young journalists led by Bektour Iskender, founder of opposition web portal –öloop kg Bektour sees no harm that this festival of democracy ùis sponsored by foreign money During the break, he confirms that his project is financed by the Prague civilsociety Centre They treat me as an equal They don t try to be my boss, and I m good with it ù,he says Bektour s workshop is called How to fight things you hate doing what you like ù It looks like he has honed his skills to perfection and is quite happy doing journalism in Kyrgyzstan with US funding The workshop starts off very much like one of those self esteem web courses where you have to write a list of things you don t like about yourself; only instead of I m overweight ùor I m single ùyou write down things that are wrong with your country, like corruption, ùor totalitarianism, ùor Putin, ùor fake news, ùor no respect for children ùMasha, a student from Odessa seems to be unable to figure out what to write under What do you hate most? ùInstead of ùcorruption ùshe finally settles on sloppy eaters ù Step number two: think of a solution to the problem you ve indicated using something you enjoy doing Zhenya from Siberia and Boris from Dushanbe spend the next 15 minutes thinking of how they can overthrow the government while sky gazing in the trees ùSounds downright comical, but the guys admit freely that they don t mind using falsification and manipulation for the right cause, if necessary We can spread a rumor that the authorities are going to cut down trees ù,they begin The audience cheers them on Sure, that s not true, but if we scare enough people, if we make them believe they are about to lose something good, that might help make them more active and start asking the government questions ù Artist Dasha Sozanovich goes on to explain in her workshop how to use cool visuals for protest purposes Pictures work for both good and evil, ùshe says The Islamic State s (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) visual campaign is an example of how pictures served evil ù Dasha s own project called Khabarstan ùis, on the other hand, an example of how pictures serve the good guys ùHer presentation makes Kazakhstan funding state TV channels much more exciting Dasha points out that it was the Prague civilsociety Centre that united all those who collaborated on this project –ü–µ—Ä–µ–¥–¥–µ–Ω—å#Halloween–∑–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏–ª–∏#–•–∞ –∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω https:// tdotco /hHDeJys8dgno poka da pic twitter com/PNTO5JisMq Dasha s pictures do their best to help the viewers understand that spending state money on media is very wrong No one mentions though that her time, meals, travel and lodging expenses have been fully covered from the state budget of the United States of America Two young artists are working away on their whiteboards creating stylish animations of the presentations they see, instead of taking notes the traditional way That looks very cool, too I decided to be an activist 11 years ago It all started at a police station ùThat s a comic strip, where one of the artists captured the essence of what another star of the Armenian Revolution David Sansaryan was saying One more piece of advice young activists get here is that they should focus on social media, like Russian social networks OK ru and VK ru, as well as Facebook, since they can t really compete with real media The main goal is to elicit a response, get people to repost and comment on their publications It s like something out of this world for us, ùsays a girl from Kazakhstan There are also young people from Russia and Belarus here, dreaming to repeat Yerevan s success ùVanya from Perm confesses to the supportive audience that he came here to export the revolution ùThat s exactly what our friends ùfrom Prague, Europe s partisans of democracy are going to be teaching them all four days of the forum However, the excitement he created gets killed by a word of reason from head organizer Maria Sereda She reminds all those present about security and requests them to refrain from tweeting this catchy slogan, or we ll have Russian cameras all over the place in no time ù The forum also offers a handful of workshops on techniques that can be used to increase protest sentiment in society One workshop uses the theme of Russian folk tales In one of the cases, a forest community ùlearns to interact with the government, i e the Big Bad Wolf ùSpeaking of overthrowing the Big Bad Wolf of Belarus, ùthe head organizer says that there is only one to do it î to let the little critters anger grow over the years You ll have to let the little critters anger grow till you impeach the Big Bad Wolf, ùMaria Sereda says cheerfully This case will work great for Belarus And it has already worked for Ukraine! ù She continues to tell the audience about different anti government strategies and mentions a number of organizations that have been successful in implementing them, including the International Crisis Group, co founded by George Soros, and Amnesty International They work quietly and softy ù,Ms Sereda says They settle issues with the local governments very delicately ù One more thing young activists are being taught here is how to identify the target audience They need to aim for people who are most sensitive to liberal values propaganda Those who do not mix with other activists and don t attend protests are called a waste of time It s clear what kind of people are being talked about: if a person supports or is just neutral to Crimea rejoining Russia, they are not worth the effort The main target audience is defined as large city residents aged 20 to 40 with a university degree and mid range income The speaker believes this segment has the most potential You need to see who you re talking to Is that a loaded person with a reputation and power, or just someone who is so angry they might actually do something? ùthe speaker continues Overall, –°amp–°amp is very reminiscent of school summer camps: fun activities by the day and get togethers by the fire ùwith a potluck in the evenings The most experienced revolutionaries ù(from Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, both as stagnating as Russia ù) have the best food Many participants have met before, at the Boris Nemtsov Summer School in Prague The camp leaders ùalso know each other well The more experienced participants are very friendly to all newcomers I see Nick (Nicholas Detsch) from the United States give a warm welcome to a journalist from Kazakhstan Nicholas Detsch#lostOSCESMM#OSCE–ú—ñ—Å—ñ—è#–û–ë–°–Ñ–°–ú–ú#–û–ë–°–ï#kyiv#USApic twitter com/Jc2S6F3glx Nick introduces himself as an OSCE officer and recounts his rich experience working in Central Asia He takes the most interest in talking to those who came on their own initiative He meets all the new people and takes notes in his little book Nick does not mention the fact that he works for the US Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (an organization that was declared undesirable ùin Russia) His website profile, however, does mention the fact that Nicholas Detsch was one of the foundation s first observers dispatched to Ukraine in 2014 This article was initially published onRT Russian Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won t tell you RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/451372-camp-yerevan-protests-us-money/

unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them Think your friends would be interested?

"12 Sep, 2018",EU's 'dangerous' move to punish Hungary 'reveals its authoritarian grip',"The EU parliament s vote to trigger Article 7, allowing punitive measures against Hungary, has provoked disbelief and indignation, with commentators describing the authoritarian move as contrary to the bloc s own self interests Citing Hungary s anti immigration policies and concerns about media suppression, the European Parliament voted on Wednesday to invoke the provision, known as the nuclear option, which is applied when there is a clear risk of a serious breach of EU values by one of the member states Implementing Article 7 allows for sanctions to be imposed on Budapest, including stripping the nation of its voting rights in the European Council The motion, which passed 448 197 with 48 abstentions, was roundly condemned by prominent Eurosceptics Former UKIP leader and champion of Brexit, Nigel Farage, warned that the vote revealed the ever tightening authoritarian grip of the European Union European Parliament votes to remove Hungary s voting rights, the authoritarian grip of the EU gets even tighter But those who support the European project and are working towards a more unified bloc should also be outraged, British historian, philosopher and author John Laughland told RT It s amazing to me that the European Parliament has done this From their own point of view, for their own institutional self interest, it s crazy The vote will likely also galvanize anti immigration parties ahead of European Parliament elections to be held in May, Paolo Raffone, a political analyst and founder of the CIPI Foundation, a Brussels based think tank, said This is a very dangerous type of action from the parliament, because on the issues of values, there s a lot of debate in European society He told RT that the recent successes of Eurosceptic political movements across Europe should serve as a wake up call to Brussels There is a clear trend of populist nationalist parties making gains throughout Europe, Raffone said, adding that it would be unwise of some of Europe s most powerful states, including France and Germany, to think that they are immune to the growing tide of Euroscepticism Still, the vote clearly served the purpose of making an example of Budapest, which has challenged Brussel s open door migrant policy and the bloc s concept of European values Laughland said that the vote sets a clear precedent that puts other EU states on notice Last December, Article 7 was triggered against Poland, marking the first time the measure was implemented But will the nuclear option achieve the desired results? Independent journalist Luc Rivet told RT that the vote accomplished little aside from victimizing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose popularity with Hungarians is only likely to increase While the vote s outcome was expected, what was truly shocking was the language used by MEPs and even senior EU officials while denouncing Orban during a debate in parliament on Tuesday European Commission vice president Frans Timmermanssaidthat Orban had chosen a coward s way out by claiming that the EU was targeting the whole of Hungary, rather than just its government MEPs also hurled insults at Orban, with Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, describing the Hungarian leader as a neo fascist Rivet said that these comments revealed an astonishing rift in the bloc s sense of unity The worst that Europe can produce we heard yesterday and today This bullying will go nowhere because Article 7 will never be applied Italy, Austria and Poland will refuse of course that this be applied, at council level, if not at parliament level Laughland also took aim at the report authored by Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini, which was used to determine that there is a clear risk that Hungary could be undermining the values of the European Union He called the report a grotesque exercise in disinformation, which is full of half truths and untruths, which really does great to discredit to the woman who drew it up Rivet echoed a similar sentiment, describing the report authored by Sargentini as a piece of work It s really incredibly aggressive in its content, and she didn t even go to Hungary to make this report She only relied upon sources like Mr George Soros and his friends So really it s incredible For Laughland, Sargentini s report illustrates two very distinct European worldviews When you compare it to the Hungarian government s response, you can see that you are dealing on the one hand with intelligence, with people who are intelligent and civilized, and on the other hand with someone who is stupid and malicious And in a way I think that s the most frightening aspect of it this conflict between intelligence and stupidity, or between civilized behavior and nastiness Like this story?

"17 Nov, 2017",Soros and his ‚Äò226 EU friends‚Äô thrust into spotlight by Farage ‚Äì so who are they?,"Picking up the anti Soros torch from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, UK politician Nigel Farage is seeking to investigate fellow EU MEPs who support the controversial vision of the wealthy financier But are Orban and Farage s fears valid? UK politician Nigel Farage, the prominent face of Brexit, is now concerned about Europe s destiny Addressing the EU Parliament this week, Farage provided some thoughtful ideas as to the source of the claims that Russia had somehow manipulated the Brexitvote, as well as the Trumpelection Just last week, the electoral commission, in the UK, launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money, ùFarage said This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organization called Open Society ù But Farage, who seems to take great delight in agitating his fellow MPs, was just warming up He went on to provide yet another example of an EU parliamentarian working on behalf of George Soros, this time against Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, who hasaccusedthe financier of seeking to create a Europe of mixed population ù We even had last week Mr [Guy] Verhofstadtlobbyingon behalf of Mr Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, ùFarage said, pointing directly at Verhofstadt as he spoke I wonder, ùFarage continued, when we are talking about political collusion, I wonder if we are looking in the wrong place ù FaragedescribedSoros s influence in Strasbourg and Brussels as truly extraordinary ùAnd that influence looks set to increase dramatically now that Soros has donated the bulk of his wealth $18 billion into his Open Society pet project, which campaigns for open borders and supranational structures such as the European Union Farage concluded his short, fiery monologue with a weighty statement: I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international, political collusion in history ù On the surface, there seems to be some legitimacy to Farage s claim According to public sources, Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of Open Society Foundations, met with members of the European Commission on 44 separateoccasionsin 2016 And now that the organization has just been energized with $18 billion, it would seem apparent that that influence is set to increase Moreover, the Soros organizations published a pamphlet providing details on a list of 226 reliable friends ùwho serve in the European Parliament Farage said he would call on the parliament to set up a special committee to investigate the issue In a 177 page pamphletpublishedby Open Society, entitled Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014 2019), ù226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views According to the pamphlet, The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support Open Society s work Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, reliable allies ù of George Soros hold at least one third of seats So what sort of qualifications does an MEP need to be included among Open Society s reliable allies? ù A quick preview of the candidate s description field provides some good indication as to what Soros expects from his allies, including a political philosophy that includes support of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or intersex) movement, open borders and an anti Russia stance Among the 226 chosen, there is one Yana Toom, an MEP from Estonia, who comes in for a bit of criticism despite her inclusion Refused supporting the European Parliament s first resolution on the Ukraine Russia conflict in July 2014, and may be pro Russia to an unknown extent (and, in that case, not necessarily an Open Society) ù For anyone who questions whether Open Society works directly against Russian interests, that single line should dispel all doubts Moreover, it provides some background as to why Russia in 2015 banned Open Society from operating on its territory due to the threat itposedto the country s constitutional order ù Another MEP on the list, Monica Macovei of Romania, serves as something like the golden mean for star studded Soros status Resolutely progressive; unquestionable ally of Open Society values; does not hesitate to go against her group s instructions; however, can sometimes be described as a loose cannon with her own, uncompromising set of priorities ù When reading such an assessment, one might get the mistaken impression that the European Parliament is designed to serve the will of George Soros and his highly controversial agenda, as opposed to the will of the European peoples To say that George Soros, who was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, has an influence on the global scene, would be the understatement of the century His excessive wealth allows him to finance a veritablearmy of organizations, many serving at cross purposes Indeed, Soros, 87, has been connected to movements and civil disturbances as diverse as distanced asBlack Lives Mattermovement in the US, to the Maidanuprisingin Ukraine And nowhere has Soros s influence been more felt than in the ongoing European debate over migrants It looks like the European refugee crisis, which has been blamed on the Syrian civil war, would not occur in its current intensity without the direct assistance of the Open Society Foundation Thanks to the advocacy work of the Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM), both Soros sponsored organizations, the mass resettlement of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa into Europebecamethe norm In fact, it appeared that the so called Merkel Plan ù the deal struck by the EU and Turkey was the brainchild of the European Stability Initiative, in addition to the largesse of George Soros foundations, ùF William Engdahlwrotein the Near Eastern Outlook Considering that the massive influx of Muslim migrants threatens to change the face of Christian Europe ùforever, and without any vote on the matter by the people of Europe, perhaps it is time to see exactly what kind of direct influence George Soros and his Open Society Foundation are having on European parliamentarians After all, these are not the play toys of any one individual, but the representatives of an entire state George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Robert Bridge, for RT @Robert_Bridge RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/410223-soros-allies-migrants-farage-orban/

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of color revolutions ù around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first color revolution, ùa technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed There is just one problem None of it is true The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned ùfrom Communism and despoiled in the process Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed ù the creation of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election Meanwhile, a student movement called Otpor (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US trained activists, like Srda Popovic Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience Suitcases of cash ù smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5 Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum As a result, ƒêindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist ù expediency Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre or post electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the Orange Revolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, color revolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences there is always the next revolution to plan and execute And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator ù(there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems Before the dust from the revolution clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters While the color revolutions are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago Nebojsa Malic for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/
"11 Sep, 2017",Korean nuclear tension: Apocalypse... almost now,"The saber rattling and harsh rhetoric during the current nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula should remind mankind of something we have forgotten Atomic weapons are terrifying things, and talk of using them should be a taboo subject is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London A week or so ago, I found myself reading Agatha Christie s 80th, and penultimate, book, Passenger to Frankfurt, and its relevance to today struck me The book was published in 1970, with the subtitle an extravaganza, ùis an utter failure and was often characterized as an incomprehensible muddle ù; however, this muddle is not due to Christie s old age or senility: instead, its causes are clearly political Passenger to Frankfurt is Christie s most personal, intimately felt, and at the same time most political novel It expresses her personal confusion, her feeling of being totally at a loss with what was going on in the world in the late 1960s the drugs, the sexual revolution, student protests, murders, etc So it s no wonder that Passenger to Frankfurt is not a detective novel There is no murder, no logic, and deduction This feeling of the collapse of the elementary cognitive mapping, this overwhelming fear of chaos, is rendered precisely in Christie s introduction to the novel: Hold up a mirror to 1970 in England Look at that front page every day for a month, make notes, consider and classify Every day there is a killing A girl strangled An elderly woman attacked and robbed of her meager savings Young men or boys attacking or attacked Buildings and telephone kiosks smashed and gutted Drug smuggling Robbery and assault Children missing and children s murdered bodies found not far from their homes Can this be England? Is England really like this? Not yet, but it could be Fear is awakening, a fear of what may be And not only in our own country There are smaller paragraphs on other pages giving news from Europe, from Asia, from the Americas, in Worldwide News Hi jacking of planes Kidnapping Violence Riots Hate Anarchy All growing stronger All seeming to lead to worship of destruction, pleasure in cruelty What does it all mean? ù Is our era with † leaders ù †like Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? So what does all this mean? In the novel, Christie provides her answer a terrible worldwide conspiracy which has something to do with Richard Wagner and The Young Siegfried We learn that, toward the end of World War II, Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war He then escaped to Argentina where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel The Young Siegfried ùMeanwhile, in the book s present, drugs, promiscuity, and student protests are all secretly caused by Nazi agitators who want to bring about anarchy so that they can restore Nazi domination on a world scale This terrible worldwide conspiracy ùis, of course, ideological fantasy at its purest: a weird condensation of the fear of extreme right and extreme left The least we can say to Christie s credit is that she locates the heart of the conspiracy to the extreme right (neo Nazis) and not in any of the other usual suspects (Communism, Jews, Muslims, etc ) The idea neo Nazis were behind the 68 student protesters and sexual liberation struggle, with its obvious madness, nonetheless bears witness to the disintegration of a consistent cognitive mapping of our predicament Christie is compelled to take refuge in such a crazy paranoiac construct as the only way to introduce some order and meaning into the utter confusion and panic she found herself in But is her vision really too crazy to be taken seriously? Is our era with leaders ùlike Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? Our situation is messy in a way very similar to the one described by Christie: a rightist government enforcing workers rights (in Poland), a leftist government pursuing the strictest austerity politics (in Greece) Thus, it s no wonder that, to regain a minimal cognitive mapping, Christie resorts to WWII, the last good war, ùretranslating our mess into its coordinates One should nonetheless note how the very form of Christie s answer (one big secret agent behind it all) strangely mirrors the fascist idea of the Jewish conspiracy: how there is one big Nazi plot behind which lies the explanation to everything And, today, the extreme populist right proposes a similar explanation of the Muslim immigrant threat ùIn antisemitic imaginary, the Jew ùis the invisible master who secretly pulls the strings, which is why Muslim immigrants are NOT today s Jews: they are all too visible, not invisible They are clearly not integrated into our societies, and nobody claims they secretly pull strings if one sees in their invasion of Europe ùa secret plot, then Jews have to be behind it As was the case in a text that recently appeared in one of the main Slovenian Rightist weekly journals where we could read: George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time, ùresponsible for the invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU as a typical Talmudo Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of Western civilization, the nation state and white, European man ù His goal is to build a rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work hating cultural Marxists, ùwhich would then perform a deconstruction of the nation state, and transform the EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe ùFurthermore, Soros is inconsistent in his promotion of multiculturalism: He promotes it exclusively in Europe and the USA, while in the case of Israel, he, in a way which is for me totally justified, agrees with its monoculturalism, latent racism and building a wall In contrast to the EU and USA, he also does not demand from Israel to open its borders and accept refugees A hypocrisy appropriate to Talmudo Zionism ù[Quoted from Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç, George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time (in Slovene), Demokracija, August 25 2016, p 15 ] Is this disgusting fantasy which brings together antisemitism and Islamophobia so different from the one staged by Christie? Are they both not a desperate attempt to orient oneself in confused times? The extreme oscillations in the public perception of the Korean crisis are significant as such One week we are told we are on the brink of nuclear war, then there is a week of respite, then the war threat explodes again When I visited Seoul in August 2017, my friends there told me there is no significant threat of a war since the North Korean regime knows it cannot survive it, but now the South Korean authorities are preparing the population for a nuclear war In such a situation, where the apocalypse is on the horizon, one should bear in mind the standard logic of probability no longer applies, we need a different logic, described by Jean Pierre Dupuy: The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as destiny, for sure, but also as a contingent accident if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example, it could not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not occur, it is not inevitable It is thus the event s actualization the fact that it takes place which retroactively creates its necessity ù[ Jean Pierre Dupuy, Petite metaphysique des tsunami, Paris: Seuil 2005, p 19 ] Dupuy provides the example of the French presidential elections in May 1995; here is the January forecast of the main polling Institute: If on next May 8th, Mr (√âdouard) Balladur will be elected, one can say the presidential election was decided before it even took place ù The moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities When applied to the recent tension in Korea, this means: IF the war explodes, it will be necessary and inevitable; IF war will not explode, it was all a false alarm This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of nuclear (or ecological) catastrophe: not to realistically ùappraise the possibilities of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on the background of this acceptance, we should mobilize ourselves to perform the act which will change destiny itself and thereby insert a new possibility into the situation Instead of saying the future is still open, we still have the time to act and prevent the worst, ù one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable, and then work to undo what is already written in the stars ùas our destiny What is needed is no less than a new global anti nuclear movement, a global mobilization that would exert pressure on nuclear powers and act aggressively, organizing mass protests and boycotts, while denouncing our leaders as criminals and the like It should focus not only on North Korea but also on those super powers who assume the right to monopolize nuclear weapons The very public mention of the use of nuclear weapons should be treated as a criminal offense And more than that, a global change in our stance is needed, what Peter Sloterdijk calls the domestication of the wild animal culture ù Till now, each culture disciplined and educated its own members and guaranteed civic peace among them in the guise of state power, but the relationship between different cultures and states was permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each state of peace nothing more than a temporary armistice As Hegel conceptualized it, the entire ethic of a state culminates in the highest act of heroism, the readiness to sacrifice one s life for one s nation state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within a state Is today s North Korea with its ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons, and rockets to deliver them to distant targets, not the ultimate example of this logic of unconditional nation state sovereignty? However, the moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities A task rendered all the more difficult by the ongoing rise of sectarian religious and ethnic heroic ùviolence and readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one s specific cause The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/402959-korean-nuclear-christie-apocalypse-zizek/

"15 Feb, 2017",Munich Security Report: Here comes the apocalypse,"In advance of the 2017 Munich Security Conference (MSC) the organizers have published a report with the subheading Post Truth, Post West, Post Order? The question answers itself, though not for reasons Western liberals will likely accept In the interests of accuracy let us be clear: it is not the West, it is Western liberalism that is in crisis The two entities are distinct and indeed, as events have and continue to prove, completely antithetical to one another The first paragraph of theMSC reportreads as if the end of the world is upon us The world is facing an illiberal moment Across the West and beyond, illiberal forces are gaining ground From within, Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal democratic status quo From outside, Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises with Syria as the prime example ù #Assad: US Russia cooperation could benefit Syria & wider worldhttps:// tdotco /G8xOCEeI9B Implied in this statement is the assumption that liberalism, or liberal values, should be considered sacrosanct, the sine qua non of cultural, political, economic and moral virtue, and as such the values according to which every country, society, and people must exist, regardless of cultural, regional, or historical specificities Therein lies the problem Despite the carnage, chaos, instability, conflict without end, societal collapse, and economic dislocation that has been wrought in the name of those very sacrosanct liberal values and liberal democracy in recent times, its proponents continue to live in a state of abject denial Try telling the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Africa, Latin America, who ve seen their countries and societies destroyed in service to liberal democracy, about this illiberal moment ù they are meant to fear Try telling the ever and shamefully increasing number of victims of poverty, lack of education, poor housing, bad or non existent healthcare provision in Western countries, where liberal values predominate, about them also And when it comes to Syria, cited in the report as evidence of a security crisis ùwhich Western states seem unwilling and unable to effectively tackle, ùhave these people no shame? The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al Qaeda against the US in 2001 In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term Western civilization Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: Donald Trump s comments about NATO being obsolete ù have caused great uncertainty among America s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe The European Union is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia ù Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change i e in the former Yugoslavia and Libya It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal democratic values and norms have wrought In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests As George Orwell wrote, War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength ù No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem What they describe as a revisionist Russia ùis really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony Replace revisionist ùwith strong, ùand you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017 They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society Russia s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/377466-munich-security-trump-russia-eu/
"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety, limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ If you were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The Open Society Institute (OSI) and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the European Union, going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/

"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European 'forced migration',"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called Color Revolutions, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps:// tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the Open Society Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety, we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/
"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta s desperate quest for legitimacy Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military final solution for the east In 2001, the Austrian
 economist Hans Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled Democracy:
 The God that Failed , in which he among other things 
 compared the process of voting to a religious ritual Just as the
 ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
 ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
 kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity In his
 study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
 monarchies actually safeguarded peoples lives and liberty far
 more than democracy has before making a case for outright
 anarchy Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
 democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
 home Western leaders routinely speak of democracy as a
 virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as rooted in the sanctity of the individual ù(BH Obama in
 Talinn, September 2014) In actuality, democracy is simply a
 decision making process in which the majority gets its way The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they liberate , however, democracy means whatever the
 liberators say it means Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
 independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not democratic 
 because the High Priesthood in the West says so while the
 violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was midwifed ùby Washington (per V Nuland s famous phone
 call) Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
 junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
 against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem Its prime
 minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
 Americans ( Yats is our guy, ùto quote Nuland again) 
 Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
 presidential vote in May By the time it was held, Donetsk and
 Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
 their separation Even so, the junta s Western backers proclaimed
 Petro Poroshenko elected on May 25 as the legitimate leader
 of Ukraine Quite unlike the aggressor and invader ù it was
 accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
 Poroshenko launched an all out war against the two eastern
 regions That war was lost Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
 lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
 battalions such as Azov have terrorized any civilians
 they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
 have failed Hence all the crying about Russian
 invasion to the Western press, but also the coming general
 election That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
 sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
 they are democratic , and thus worth backing More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
 nine months, this weekend s vote will showcase the absurdity of democracy as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic 
 What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
 procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
 up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
 acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
 between the Nationalist Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
 boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko And with
 every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis 
 not the neo variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind 
 that triangle keeps getting smaller Recent polls by the Western funded Democratic Initiatives
 Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post suggest a significant
 lead for President Poroshenko s party, followed by Lyashko s
 Radicals and Yatsenyuk s People s Front Meanwhile, the
 formerly ruling Party of Regions and the Communists 
 intimidated, brutalized and all but banned are polling in
 single digits However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
 they were undecided ù, which suggests they are either
 afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven t yet decided on the
 lesser of evils Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
 under Kiev s control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
 their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
 Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open
 for business But the liberators themselves won t get
 to vote; for whatever reason, the junta s legislature failed to
 pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front Meanwhile, the civilsociety organizations funded for
 years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy
 lists OPORA as one of its aid recipients in 2009) to create
 fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
 violations of campaign rules Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
 already reported over 527 violations, including at least 80
 cases of alleged voter bribery ùThey either haven t got the
 memo about how this election should be a showcase of democratic 
 Ukraine versus the authoritarian Russia, or they did
 get the memo, and are significantly under reporting voter
 intimidation and manipulation For their part, the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics are refusing to
 go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
 November 7 They may not have a chance to hold them There isn t
 much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
 artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by A
 renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
 idea, but the junta s generals have certainly demonstrated
 greater stupidity over the course of the campaign When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several

 morning news served up to strike fear and loathing A thousand
 authors, conjure for you, images of Russian bears devouring
 Europe, of gleaming scimitars slicing the air, and a rerun of
 those twin towers plummeting, down, down, down But this is a
 time of WikiLeaks, the NSA spies, lies, deceit, and misdirect 
 You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
 blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
 brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
 greed, graft, and mediocre leaders The fact is ISIS, the Arab
 Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
 Washington policy under Obama This cannot be repudiated, but it
 can be reasoned In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr Ahmed Bensaada
 assembles a body of evidence that the so called Arab Spring was a
 destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
 the US State Department and historically CIA funded foundations
 for so called freedom No, you c1985annot use the he s one
 of them ùexcuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
 Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
 Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
 Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
 Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
 reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
 Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
 Development (USAID) î and George Soros Open Society Institute
 (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
 that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary The hierarchy
 and system behind him might be the anti Christ As proof the system ùof thought in the west it corrupted, let s look
 at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
 industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime s Senatorial
 superhero While some of us would like to classify his brand of
 Neo conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
 presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
 witness to systematic abuses Case in point, McCain is head of an
 organization known as the International Republican Institute
 (IRI) That institution s stated goal is to; advance
 democracy worldwide ù but the how, ùthe spread,
 and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us The
 good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
 analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
 Department Recently IRI worked with the U S Middle East Partnership
 Initiative (MEPI) The point here is, in many instances where
 Arab Spring or seeming anti Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
 organizations like McCain s IRI are somehow present This quote
 from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute s
 (IRI) Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership ù project 
 This project supports independent democratic political activists
 and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
 dialogue IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
 Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
 research to key partners, stakeholders, civilsociety
 representatives and influential decision makers ù But still further inside American geo strategizing, the
 aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
 utter decay of thinking Thisreportentitled, On Strategic
 Non Violent Change, ùby one of the world s leading
 insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
 blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
 corporations Helvey s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
 into insurrectionists are well known But his recent coming out
 over Ukraine s recent coup d √©tat, ùthis is lesser
 known Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
 wrong is with us While most of us know we love peace, the rest
 of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
 killers It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
 guide for a kind of governing This guide has been in practice in
 Washington for some decades now Much has been written about
 Machiavelli s The Prince, ùbut this quote reveals the
 essence of Machiavellian intent: The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
 world consists chiefly of the vulgar ù Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
 belief Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
 Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
 by untimely anti Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
 from the west Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
 Peace and Prosperity calls the West s subversion of the Ukraine
 peace process by NATO a grand deception ùBut beyond
 just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
 of editorials for peace There simply is no anti war ùsentiment, not in the press To sum up here, you don t have to have a PhD in political science
 to understand Machiavellian intentions The Italian philosopher
 outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
 congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a prince ùor dictator Power, as such, was outlined as
 ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise 
 The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
 mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
 makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
 us today Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
 of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize The continual
 stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
 Machiavelli s principles, as do Obama s grand schemes for health
 care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare In a
 nutshell, Obama s advisers are political scientists of the first
 order To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey s Einstein Institute piece
 again; A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
 obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
 public ù Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
 huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli London, Berlin and
 Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
 reason But in studying Niccol√≤ di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
 you ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
 practice the kingly game What s important for us all is the
 purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism Has America
 acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
 intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
 leave to you As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
 Shelley s modern Prometheus is upon us We have this passage from
 Frankenstein: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
 make peace with all I have love in me the likes of which you can
 scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not

"3 Apr, 2014",Billionaire George Soros behind major push for marijuana legalization,"Hungarian American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros is no stranger when it comes to throwing around money, but the former hedge fund manager is making headlines over some major donations he s made to help legalize marijuana On the heels of the approval of two of the United States first
 recreational laws in Colorado and Washington, other locales
 across the country are considering implementing policy changes
 that could decriminalize pot, ease penalties for users or
 eliminate weed laws altogether Advocacy groups are leading the
 campaign to crush marijuana prohibition from coast to coast, and
 83 year old Soros is helping line the pockets of those making
 that push On Wednesday this week, Kelly Riddell atThe Washington Timespulled back the curtain
 to reveal details about some of the roles that Soros has played
 in the pro weed debate, and helped explain how the billionaire s
 many foundations are fighting the war against pot prohibition Through a network of nonprofit groups, Mr Soros has spent
 at least $80 million on the legalization effort since 1994, when
 he diverted a portion of his foundation s funds to organizations
 exploring alternative drug policies, according to tax
 filings, ùRiddell wrote The Soros affiliated Foundation to Promote an Open
 Societydonates roughly $4 million annually to the Drug Policy Alliance,
 Riddell added, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the
 nation s leading organization promoting drug policies that are
 grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights Soros
 is among the group of board members who help steer policy reform
 efforts undertaken by that organization, which has contributed to
 the successful attempts in both Colorado and Washington state to
 legalize recreational marijuana, as well as in Uruguay where last
 year the South American country became the first in the world to
 allow for the regulation, distribution and sale of weed to legal
 adults Records obtained by the Times also reveal that Soros cuts other
 substantial checks annually to the American Civil Liberties
 Union, which in turn funds marijuana legalization
 efforts, ù Riddell wrote, as well as the Marijuana Policy
 Project which funds state ballot measures In 2013, the MPP
 ranked Soros as the ninth most influential marijuana user in the
 US, behind President Barack Obama, television host Oprah Winfrey
 and a handful of other politicians and celebrities The co director and spokesperson for that group, Mason Tvert,
 told the Times that MPP and the Drug Policy Alliance are planning
 to support full legalization measures in the near future in the
 states of Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine, Montana and
 Nevada, and Soros himself has advocated on behalf of previous
 attempts to abolish pot prohibition in at least one of those
 locales Ahead of an attempt in November 2010 to legalize weed in
 California through the failed Proposition 19, Soros wrote an
 op ed for theWall Street Journalin which he called the
 since failed initiative a major step forward ù In many respects, of course, Proposition 19 already is a
 winner no matter what happens on Election Day, ù Soros wrote
 then The mere fact of its being on the ballot has elevated
 and legitimized public discourse about marijuana and marijuana
 policy in ways I could not have imagined a year ago ù Soros declined to be interviewed for the Times article published
 this week, but he s more than likely enthused about the approval
 of pro weed laws in Colorado and Washington carried out after
 Prop 19 was defeated in the polls And with regards to
 initiatives up for vote during the 2014 election, Riddell wrote
 that Soros is once again playing a substantial role In Florida, Mr Soros has teamed up with multimillionaire
 and Democratic fundraiser John Morgan to donate more than 80
 percent of the money to get medical marijuana legalization on the
 ballot through its initiative United for Care, People United for
 Medical Marijuana, ù Riddell wrote, and the MPP is
 focusing a lot of time and resources passing bills ù in
 Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and
 Vermont, according to her report It s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized
 under federal law, ù Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the
 Marijuana Majority advocacy group, told the Times We now
 have 20 states plus the District of Columbia considering
 legalization efforts, two states have already legalized it for
 all adults over the age of 21 î politicians will have to follow
 the will of the people on this ù AsRT reportedpreviously, the results of a Pew
 Research Center poll released last year found that 52 percent of
 Americans support the legalization of marijuana Despite recently
 approved laws in Washington and Colorado, marijuana remains an
 illegal narcotic under federal law RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/soros-mpp-times-marijuana-189/
"28 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIntellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ] The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia This has been the color revolutions that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments It s not something that comes as a surprise to me SS:You ve mentioned Georgia and Orange Revolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s SS:You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another prot√©g√© of that whole Shachtmanite issues You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations SS:But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years SS:The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent ù SR:I absolutely agree The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned ù or gotten out of control ù it s a fine line There are individuals who are very well trained These NGOs operate on every level They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier because the patrols are less likely it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia Herzegovina is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the European Union has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time SS:With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? ù What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing SS:If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp of ¶ and there s a lot of money that comes with that There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders it comes with the good price tag SS:So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your money ¶NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative SS:If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either Let s say that NATO does want to come in they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies ¶because NATO won t come in as a state, run only ¶you know, European Union will have to come alongside it So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it I think the Western economy is poison SS:You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that ¶ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic That s the problem that I have with this You talk about hegemony the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance SS:What about these sanctions that the U S and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success They would slow down the amount of success that they are having The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the European Union, and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia ¶you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time SS:But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany ¶ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise SS: ¶It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, ù how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the European Union I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine SS:If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"11 Oct, 2013",American truckers are putting Washington DC on notice,"There seems to be no end to the political theater in Washington DC But what began as a simple game of chicken between the White House and the Republican opposition has quickly morphed into a game of political Russian roulette Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK Patrick Henningsen is an American writer, global affairs analyst and the founder of independent news and analysis site †21st Century Wire He also hosts the †SUNDAY WIRE †weekly radio show, broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) He has written for a number of international publications and has done extensive on the ground reporting in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East, and holds an MA in International Relations from the University of Plymouth, UK A nation polarized, stuck in the ultimate political gridlock
 imaginable over federal spending As America waits for a
 resolution to the federal government shutdown, an unlikely
 community has decided to put their money where their mouth is By
 all accounts, they are the most under appreciated industry in
 today s America Truck drivers are the backbone of the American
 economy Everything Americans own, buy and need is delivered to
 them by trucks daily, yet few take any notice of the people
 behind the wheels That could all change after this weekend, as
 America gets a taste of its first ever diesel driven flash mob According the organizers at RideForTheConstitution org, over
 3,000 truckers, thousands more demonstrators on foot, have
 already RSVP d to converge on the nation s capital starting this
 Friday, Oct 11th, as they plan to slow traffic into Washington
 DC, and present a list of demands to law makers there Somebody had to do it, ùexplained Zeeda Andrews, a former
 country singer and Mac Truck spokesmodel Organizers have been
 surprised by the amount of support they ve gathered since their
 campaign gained visibility last month I didn t think it would be this big Maybe that s because the
 American people are just fed up It s more than just a trucking
 issue now, we are in a constitutional crisis and something has to
 be done, and it s common people like myself with nothing to
 lose, who are going to get something done ù Considering the fact that most people have never sat in the cab
 of an 18 wheeler in their life, the DC truckers have somehow
 managed to attract a pretty wide appeal Already, parallel
 protests have sprung up, set to take place in most major US
 cities on Friday and Saturday Larry Klayman, a former US Justice Department prosecutor, and
 founder of Freedom Watch, has also volunteered his support for
 the DC truckers campaign This past summer Klayman represented
 the families of Navy SEAL Team 6 who were killed when their
 Chinook helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan in August 2011,
 following the White House s rather incredible raid on the alleged
 bin Laden lair in Abbotabad, Pakistan I m throwing my support behind this campaign because we ve
 have had enough Our government has broken away from the people,
 and our grievances are not being heard, so we need to get out
 there and make it clear to the powers that be that be whether
 it s President Obama, Speaker of the House John Boehner, or
 whether it s majority leader Harry Reid in the Senate that we
 are simply not going to take it anymore The time has come to
 save our country, and we ll do it in the style of Ghandi, Lech
 Walesa, and Martin Luther King ù, said Klayman Organisers will join Klayman today at the steps of the US Capitol
 building to present their list of demands At the top of that
 list is an appeal for economic survival, with a call for
 immediate action on the spiralling cost of diesel and harassment
 from federal regulatory agencies which is not only driving up
 costs of goods and services, but also killing transportation
 profits, pushing independent truckers into fuel poverty, and
 ultimately out of business Beyond this emerges a broader spectrum movement of political
 dissent, which echoes concerns heard from many different quarters
 in the US As far as civil disobedience goes, their protest is no walk in
 the park Logistically speaking, it s a nightmare Then there s
 the political demands, which, in terms of the average Americans 
 attention deficit disorder, are comprehensive, and not exactly
 media friendly especially for the likes of MSNBC and FOX But
 unlike the much celebrated, but highly ineffective Occupy
 Movement, which ended up being a controlled street party whose
 indelible mark on society was that it produced a boiled down
 abstract of class warfare The 1% vs the 99% the DC
 Truckers have a fairly sharp libertarian agenda, coupled with a
 detailed list of constitutional demands Unless you ve been hiding in a bunker lately, you would know that
 something is serious brewing in America In the last year alone,
 the White House has been dodging and fighting to stave off a
 seemingly endless daisy chain of scandals In addition to the
 Navy SEAL Team 6 cover up, there is a not so small issue of the
 White House using the IRS to target the President s political
 opponents, the horrific Benghazi cover up involving a dead US
 Ambassador and servicemen, and gun running from Libya to Syria,
 and the US support of al Qaeda fighters in Syria In addition to these and other federal interventions hurting
 truckers livelihoods, the campaign feels that all
 unconstitutional federal laws and agencies should be wiped from
 the books They include the National Defense Authorization Act
 (NDAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transport
 Security Agency (TSA), and The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) US talk radio host Pete Santilli has volunteered to help the
 truckers get their message out over the airwaves If you look at the list of demands, regardless of where you
 are in the political spectrum, you would not disagree with: stop
 supporting al Qaeda (in Syria), don t raise the debt ceiling 
 and threaten us that if we don t print another trillion dollars
 that they ll collapse out system that s a forceful means to
 steal money from us President Obama needs to be held accountable
 for crimes committed against the United States and Congress needs
 to hear those crimes ù The beauty of this event is that it is open and nonpartisan 
 it absolutely cuts right through party lines Every American can
 participate in this ù Santilli adds here, John McCain and
 Lindsey Graham they must go Any of these unconstitutional
 legislators, anyone who has committed unconstitutional acts in
 office, must vacate voluntarily If they refuse to go, we want to
 cut off their money supply so they won t be able to make millions
 off us anymore ù The Truckers are not without their enemies, who are keen to
 discredit them, silence them, or both As their campaign goes viral, so goes the media shooting match 
 The campaign has been directly targeted by George Soros funded
 leftwing outlet, Media Matters, who have been busy digging up old
 Facebook posts and likes from personal pages of Ride For
 The Constitution s organisers, in effect, waging a character
 assassination against them When running a 21st century activist campaign, one must also
 beware of deadly communitarian policing, also known as community guidelines ùpolicy Ride For The Constitution s Facebook page was live only six days
 when it received 86,000 likes, only to be promptly pulled down by
 the social network The same happened with its Twitter account,
 which was pulled down after only 6 days In both cases, accounts were frozen because of an anonymous
 complaint Santilli says he s mounting a legal challenge against one of the
 social networks It seems like the First Amendment doesn t apply on social
 networks You work hard to build up a huge audience, only to see
 it disappear in an instant because a few political enemies
 anonymously complain that they were somehow offended ù As with all political movements through history, the pain
 normally starts in the wallet Rising toll road charges and
 inflated diesel prices are forcing many out of America s trucking
 industry In 2013, the reality is that drivers are losing their
 trucks and losing their business After labour, diesel fuel is
 the second highest expense for motor carriers, and can reach as
 much as much as 20% of transport s total operating costs Organisers Zeeda Andrews and Michael JB Schaffner
 concluded in their joint statement on what they feel is a
 national crisis: By no means are these the only issues that need action, to be
 resolved There are many, many more issues that continue to
 plague this industry, as new regulations create even more
 contradictions in law As per the fourteenth amendment of our
 Constitution, No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
 abridge the privileges, or immunities of Citizens of the United
 States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty,
 or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
 within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ù ""So let these issues be the beginning of where we take a
 stand, not just as The American Drivers, but as Free and
 Independent Americans, protecting what our Constitution preserves
 for us ù At the very least Washington DC might be in for a shock this
 weekend Call it shock therapy for the political class At its
 best, it could jump start real American discourse nationwide Let the ride begin The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-economy-government-shutdown-truck-992/
"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their
associated think tanks in being effective representatives of their
constituencies ùIRI is chaired by conservative Senator John
McCain, known for his extremely aggressive position in favor of
Israel and US conflicts overseas, while other leading figures have
held senior foreign policy positions in the Reagan and Bush
administrations IRI works in countries important to U S 
interests, where we can make a difference IRI focuses on three
tasks: helping political parties broaden their appeal, ensuring
that they rule justly once elected and aiding civilsociety in
guaranteeing good governance IRI can help catalyze the efforts of
democratic activists in a country so long as they want change
more than we want it for them, ùwrites IRI s president, Lorne
Craner, who previously held a position in the US State
Department The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also
receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the Open Society
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
"6 Apr, 2013",Boao Forum: Chinese convention rivals Davos,"When people hear economic forum the first thing they probably think about is Davos and snowy Alps But that is set to change as China s Boao hosts the largest and most representative economic summit in Asia The rapid rise of the so called Asian tigers has shifted the
focus eastwards, when it comes to world economic development 
Initiated by China in 2001, the Boao Forum focuses not only on
Asian economic issues, but also address global political and
economic problems The 12th Boao Forum in 2013 has already proven to be a truly
global, not just Asian event, once again bringing the world s
attention to the emerging nations ever growing economic clout Heads of state, business leaders and Nobel Prize winners,
altogether 1,477 representatives from 43 countries and regions have
all gathered in China to discuss pressing global issues This is the largest [economic] forum in Asia, ùKsenia
Yudaeva, Russia s representative for G20 summit preparations, told
RT Here you can see that Asia is the new center of world s
economic growth ù This year the forum is attracting some big names, like
Microsoft s Bill Gates, investor George Soros and head of the IMF
Christine Lagarde The vision of that forum is really comparable to Davos in
representation of speakers of Europe, the US and Asian countries I
would call it an Asian Davos, ùsaid Yudaeva, who also occupies
position of chief of the Presidential Experts Directorate in
Russia While Europe and the US are battling economic recession, China s
trade volume is growing steadily For many countries China has
already become the number one trade partner, a place previously
occupied by the US So there is little wonder that world leaders
and business gurus from countries affected by the crisis are
flocking to China s tropical Hainan Island for some advice and,
hopefully, remedy Unlike a BRICS summit, which is largely a government to
government thing, ùthe Boao Forum serves different purposes,
because it deepens contact between the civilsociety, business
and academics ùprofessor of political studies at the University
of Manitoba, Rhadika Desai, told RT One really important thing about this is that they are going
to move away from hub and spoke relationship that the developing
countries once had with the Western world and the advanced
industrial countries and began to create more contacts,
investment and trade amongst themselves, ùsaid Desai, who has
written extensively on the rise of emerging economies The global economic crisis made the Eastern countries realize
that the best way to deal with crisis is to widen your domestic
market to engage it a lot more and make it the driver of growth 
This is very important for laying the foundation for sustainable
long term autonomous [economic] growth, ùshe stressed The old export led [economic] growth model, which was being
followed and prescribed in the pre crisis era, is basically
defunct It could work as long as the US was able and willing to
observe the goods of the Western world, but as we know, it observed

"26 Dec, 2012",US attempting regime change in Malaysia: Fact or fiction? (Op-Ed),"As the South East Asian nation of Malaysia prepares for general elections, distrust of the political opposition and accusations of foreign interference have been major talking points in the political frequencies emanating from Kuala Lumpur The United Malays National Organization (UMNO) leads the country s ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and has maintained power since Malaysian independence in 1957 One of Malaysia s most recognizable figures is former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been credited with ushering in large scale economic growth and overseeing the nation s transition from an exporter of palm oil, tin, and other raw materials, into an industrialized economy that manufactures automobiles and electronic goods The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who once held the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mahathir s administration, but was sacked over major disagreements on how to steer Malaysia s economy during the 1997 Asian financial crisis Today, the political climate in Malaysia is highly polarized and a sense of unpredictability looms over the nation Malaysia s current leader, Prime Minister Najib Razak, has pursued a reform minded agenda by repealing authoritarian legislation of the past and dramatically loosening controls on expression and political pluralism introduced under Mahathir s tenure Najib has rolled back Malaysia s Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detention without trial, and has liberalized rules regarding the publication of books and newspapers During Malaysia s 2008 general elections, the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition experienced its worst result in decades, with the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition winning 82 parliamentary seats For the first time, the ruling party was deprived of its two thirds parliamentary majority, which is required to pass amendments to Malaysia s Federal Constitution In the run up to elections scheduled to take place before an April 2013 deadline, figures from all sides of the political spectrum are asking questions about the opposition s links to foreign funders in Washington The question of foreign funding Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad has long captured the ire of officials from Washington and Tel Aviv, and though he s retired, he has channeled his energies into the Perdana Global Peace Foundation, which recently hosted an international conference in Kuala Lumpur calling for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 and has sought to investigate war crimes committed in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan Mahathir has been an ardent critic of Israel and organizations such as AIPAC, and has recently accused US based organizations the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) of holding a concealed intention to influence Malaysia s domestic politics through the funding of local NGOs and groups directly linked to Anwar Ibrahim s Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition In an article the former prime minister published in the New Straits Times, a leading mainstream newspaper, Mahathir accuses financier George Soros and his organization, the Open Society Institute, of promoting democracy ù in Eastern Europe to pave the way for colonization by global finance capital Mahathir acknowledges how OSI pumped millions into opposition movements and independent media in Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of strengthening civilsociety, only to have like minded individuals nominated by Soros s own foundation come to power in those countries The former prime minister has also pointed to how Egypt (prior to Mohamad Morsi taking power) has cracked down on NGOs affiliated with NED, namely groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and Freedom House, which are all recipients of funding from the US State Department In Malaysia, high profile NGOs and media outlets have admittedly received funding from OSI and satellite organizations of NED Premesh Chandran, the CEO of the nation s most prominent alternative media outlet, Malaysiakini, is a grantee of George Soros s Open Society Foundations and launched the news organization with a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok based Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), another organization with dubious affiliations to the US State Department Malaysiakini has come under pressure from local journalists for the lack of transparency in its financial management and hesitance in revealing the value of its shares Additionally, Suaram, an NGO promoting human rights, has borne heavy criticism over its funding and organizational structure The Companies Commission of Malaysia launched investigations into Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd, a private company linked to Suaram, and found it to be a conduit for money being used to channel funds from NED Suaram has been instrumental in legitimizing allegations of a possible cover up of the murder of a Mongolian fashion model, Altantuya Shaaribuu, who was living in Malaysia in 2006 and associated with government officials that have been linked to a kickback scandal involving the government s purchase of submarines from France Senator Ezam Mohd Nor, himself a recipient of Suaram s Human Rights Award, has accused the organization of employing poor research methods and attempting to disparage the government: Malaysians have the right to feel suspicious about them They have been making personal allegations against the Prime Minister [Najib Razak] on the murder of Altantuya and many other cases without proof their motive is very questionable especially when they are more inclined towards ridiculing and belittling the ruling government ùThe German Embassy in KL has reportedly admitted that it has provided funds to Suaram s project in 2010 Malaysia s Foreign Minister Anifah Aman followed by making strong statements to the German Ambassador and declared that Germany s actions could be viewed as interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the Open Society Institute Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton While Sreenevasan s organization claimed to be non partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations Anatomy of Malaysia s political opposition Malaysia is a multi cultural and multi religious state, and both the ruling and opposition parties attempt to represent the nation s three largest ethnic groups Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysians are either ethnic Malay or other indigenous groups and are mostly listed as Muslim, while another 25 per cent are ethnic Chinese who are predominantly Buddhist, with 7 per cent mostly Hindu Indian Malaysians The United Malays National Organization, the Malaysian Chinese Association, and the Malaysian Indian Congress head Barisan Nasional The opposition, Pakatan Rakyat, currently controls four state governments and is led by Anwar Ibrahim s Keadilan Rakyat, the Chinese led Democratic Action Party (DAP), and staunchly Islamist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) While a large percentage of urbanites with legitimate grievances are quick to acknowledge the government s shortcomings, many are hesitant to back Anwar Ibrahim due to his connections with neo conservative thinkers in Washington and general disunity within the opposition † Ibrahim maintains close ties with senior US officials and organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy In 2005, Ibrahim chaired the Washington based Foundation for the Future, established and funded by the US Department of State at the behest of Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of then Vice President Dick Cheney, thanks in large part to his cozy relationship with Paul Wolfowitz While Ibrahim was on trial for allegedly engaging in sodomy with a male aide (of which he was acquitted sometime later), Wolfowitz and former US Vice President Al Gore authored a joint opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in support of Ibrahim, while the Washington Post published an editorial calling for consequences that would affect Malaysia s relations with Washington if Ibrahim was to be found guilty Ibrahim enraged many when he stated that he would support policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview with the Wall Street Journal; this is particularly controversial in Malaysia, where support for Palestine is largely unanimous Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar writes: It is obvious that by acknowledging the primacy of Israeli security, Anwar was sending a clear message to the deep state and to Tel Aviv and Washington that he is someone that they could trust In contrast, the Najib government, in spite of its attempts to get closer to Washington, remains critical of Israeli aggression and intransigence Najib has described the Israeli government as a òserial killer and a ògangster ù Members of Barisan Nasional have addressed Ibrahim s connections to the National Endowment for Democracy in the Malaysian Parliament, including his participation in NED s òDemocracy Award event held in Washington DC in 2007 Independent journalists have uncovered letters written by Anwar Ibrahim, two of which were sent to NED President Carl Gershman in Washington DC that discussed sending an international election observer team to Malaysia and general issues related to electoral reform A third letter was sent to George Soros, expressing interest in collaborating with an accountability firm headed by Ibrahim Pakatan Rakyat s Communications Director, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, verified the authenticity of the documents This should come as little surprise, as Ibrahim s economic policies have historically aligned with institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, in contrast to Mahathir, whose protectionist economic policies opposed international financial institutions and allowed Malaysia to navigate and largely resurface from the 1997 Asian financial crisis unscathed An issue that concerns secular and non Muslim Malaysian voters is the role of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as part of the opposition In sharp contrast to the moderate brand of Islam preached by UMNO, the organization s primary objective is the founding of an Islamic state The PAS has spoken of working within the framework of Malaysia s parliamentary democracy, but holds steadfast to implementing sharia law on a national scale, which would lead to confusing implications for Malaysia s sizable non Muslim population The debate around the implementation of Islamic hudud penal code is something that other Pakatan Rakyat coalition members, such as figures in the Chinese led Democratic Action Party, have been unable to agree on The PAS enjoys support from rural Malay Muslims in conservative states such as Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu in northern Malaysia, though they have very limited appeal to urbanites While certain individuals in PAS have raised questions about NGOs receiving foreign funding, Mahathir has insinuated that PAS s leadership has been largely complicit: They [foreign interests] want to topple the government through the demonstration and Nik Aziz [Spiritual leader of PAS] said it is permissible to bring down the government in this manner They want to make Malaysia like Egypt, Tunisia, which were brought down through riots and now Syria  when the government does not fall, they [Pakatan Rakyat] can appeal to the foreign power to help and bring down, even if it means using fire power ù Feasibility of òregime change narrative It must be acknowledged that the current administration led by Prime Minister Najib Razak has made great strides toward improving relations with Washington At a meeting with President Barack Obama in 2010, Najib offered Malaysia s assistance to cooperate with the United States to engage the Muslim world; Najib also expressed willingness to deploy Malaysian aid personnel to Afghanistan, and allegedly agreed on the need to maintain a unified front on Iran s nuclear program Najib has employed a Washington based public relations firm, APCO, to improve Malaysia s image in the US and has seemingly embraced American economic leadership of the region through his support for the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement Some would argue that Najib is perhaps the most pro American leader Malaysia has ever had † ì a stark contrast to the boldness of Mahathir Despite Najib having good rapport with formal Western leaders, it is clear with whom the thank tank policy architects, Zionist lobbies, and foundation fellows have placed their loyalties Sentiment among Malaysia s youth and pro democracy ù activists, who constitute a small but vocal minority, tend be entirely dismissive of the òregime change narrative, viewing it as pre election diversionary rhetoric of the ruling party While bogeymen of the Zionist variety are often invoked in Malaysian political discourse, it would be negligent to ignore the effects of Washington sponsored òdemocracy promotion in the global context, which have in recent times cloaked mercenary elements and insurgents in the colors of freedom fighting, and successfully masked geopolitical restructuring and the ushering in of neo liberal capitalism with the hip and fashionable vigor of òpeople power coups As the United States continues to militarily increase its presence in the Pacific region in line with its strategic policy shift to East Asia, policy makers in Washington would like to see compliant heads of state who will act to further American interests in the ASEAN region Let s not ignore the elephant in the room; the real purpose of America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify the region as a counterweight against Beijing The defense ministries of Malaysia and China held a landmark defense and security consultation in September 2012, in addition to frequent bilateral state visits and enhanced economic cooperation It was the father of the current leader, Malaysia s second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, who made the landmark visit to Beijing to normalize relations in 1974, and under his son Najib, Sino Malaysian relations and cooperation have never been better Following the global economic crisis of 2008, Najib looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented economy, emphasizing increased Chinese investment into Malaysia and expanding the base of Sino Malaysian trade in areas like education and student exchange, finance, infrastructure development, science and technology, yielding lucrative and mutually beneficial results China has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures reaching US$90 billion in 2011; Malaysia is China s largest trading partner among ASEAN nations In asking the question of regime change in Malaysia, Dr Chandra Muzaffar reflects on Washington s moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the Asia Pacific region: Establishing a military base in Darwin [Australia], resurrecting the US military alliance with the Philippines, coaxing Japan to play a more overt military role in the region, instigating Vietnam to confront China over the Spratly Islands, and encouraging India to counterbalance Chinese power, are all part and parcel of the larger US agenda of encircling and containing China In pursuing this agenda, the US wants reliable allies ì not just friends ì in Asia In this regard, Malaysia is important because of its position as a littoral state with sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, which is one of China s most critical supply routes that transports much of the oil and other materials vital for its economic development Will the containment of China lead to a situation where the hegemon, determined to perpetuate its dominant power, seek to exercise control over the Straits in order to curb China s ascendancy? Would a trusted ally in Kuala Lumpur facilitate such control? The current Malaysian leadership does not fit the bill ù Backwards and forwards Pakatan Rakyat, the main opposition coalition pitted against the ruling party, has yet to offer a fully coherent organizational program, and if the coalition ever came to power, the disunity of its component parties and their inability to agree on fundamental policies would be enough to conjure angrier, disenchanted youth back on to the streets, in larger numbers perhaps What is ticklishly ironic about reading op eds penned by the likes of Wolfowitz and Al Gore, and how they laud Malaysia as a progressive and moderate model Islamic state, is that they concurrently demonize its leadership and dismiss them authoritarian thugs Surely, the ruling coalition has its shortcomings; the politicization of race and religion, noted cases of corrupt officials squandering funds, etc ì but far too few, especially those of the middle class who benefit most from energy subsidies, acknowledge the tremendous economic growth achieved under the current leadership and the success of their populist policies Najib s administration would do well to place greater emphasis on addressing the concerns of Malaysia s minorities who view affirmative action policies given to Malay ethnicities as disproportionate; income status, not ethnicity, should be a deciding factor in who receives assistance The current administration appears set to widen populist policies that make necessities affordable through subsidies and continue to assist low income earners with cash handouts Najib has acknowledged the need for broad reforms of Malaysia s state owned enterprises over concerns that crony capitalism may deter foreign investment; this should be rolled out concurrently with programs to foster more local entrepreneurship To put it bluntly, the opposition lacks confidence from the business community and foreign investors; even the likes of JP Morgan have issued statements of concern over an opposition win It should be noted that if Islamists ever wielded greater influence in Malaysia under an opposition coalition, one could imagine a sizable exodus of non Muslim minorities and a subsequent flight of foreign capital, putting the nation s economy in a fragile and fractured state And yet, the United States has poured millions into òdemocracy promotion efforts to strengthen the influence of NGOs that distort realities and cast doubt over the government s ability to be a coherent actor Malaysia does not have the kind of instability that warrants overt external intervention; backing regime change efforts may only go so far as supporting dissidents and groups affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim No matter the result of the upcoming elections, Najib appears to have played ball enough for Washington to remain more or less neutral According to Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, Malaysia s electoral process is so restrictive that a mass movement like Bersih is required to purge the system of its backwardness These are curious statements, considering that the opposition gained control of four out of 13 states in 2008, including Selangor, a key economic state with the highest GDP and most developed infrastructure In response, Najib has adhered to Bersih s demands and has called for electoral reform, forming a parliamentary select committee comprising members from both Pakatan Rakyat and Barisan Nasional As elections loom, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenavasan is already dubbing them the dirtiest elections ever seen ù ì unsurprising rhetoric from a woman being handed her talking points by the US embassy Nile Bowie for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-regime-change-871/
"24 Sep, 2012",USAID looks for ways around Russian ban (Op-Ed),"Russia s Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave USAID until October 1 to shut its doors in Moscow This is an excellent decision by the Russian Government And Washington s immediate and virulent reaction only confirms that Russia is right on target The New York Times next morning on the front page cited American officials who quickly pledged to maneuver around the Kremlin ù Even before the public announcement, on Tuesday 18 September, US Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and USAID leadership met with their Russian partners Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of the Golos Association one of the top recipients of USAID funding confirmed after the meeting that the agency is not going to leave Russia completely ù and they are brainstorming ù about how to reorganize In the meantime, Ambassador McFaul announced that it will take at least a year ù for USAID to exit Russia, according to Bloomberg News Brainstorming on how circumvent the Russian government s decision instead of how to pack up faster is only one more demonstration of Washington s utter disrespect for another country s sovereignty Indeed, there are a number of ways in which USAID can maneuver around its predicament Funding can be channeled directly from USAID headquarters in Washington to its Russian beneficiaries no need to go through a Moscow office USAID funding can be redirected through a great number of other US institutions, beginning with the National Endowment for Democracy and its four mandated institutes; private funds such as MacArthur, Soros s Open Society Institute, or Freedom House; universities Russia programs, etc To hide the American connection, USAID can channel funding through their partners in Ukraine, Poland or Georgia for their very active operations in the Caucuses; in this case the money entering Russia will be Ukrainian, Polish or, God forbid, Saakashvili s In October last year, USAID signed an agreement with Cisco Systems on joint 50/50 funding of Cisco Networking Academies for Public Service Program Cisco and other major US corporations may continue running USAID programs A year ago Michael McFaul announced an initiative to create a new US$50 million fund, essentially an endowment for a private foundation established under Russian law for Russian civilsociety groups Washington may use any combination of these and other possibilities One way to put an end to USAID activities in Russia is not only to close their Moscow office, but to insist on shutting down all USAID programs and funding for Russia This is American taxpayers money give it back to the American people, use it to help them pay mortgages instead of throwing families out of their homes Obviously, USAID cannot be allowed to stay in Moscow beyond the set date This delay will only serve to build up additional infrastructure people and organizations to run operations remotely The main lament of the Western press has been about how hard USAID closure will hit the sick, disabled, mothers, newborns and other children that the agency helps Well, let s take a look at USAID leadership to see how well they are suited for healthcare services Director of USAID/Russia Charles North, according to its official biography is a 2004 graduate of the National War College, with an MS Degree in National Security Strategy ù †Earlier North served as Senior Deputy Director of USAID s Afghanistan and Pakistan Task Force, and helped launch a presidential initiative to support Mexico and Central America in battling organized crime and drug trafficking In Washington, Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia until last year was Douglas Menarchik: a 26 year career US Air Force officer, Vietnam veteran with 211 combat missions, assistant for terrorism policy at the Pentagon, where he developed the Defense Department s Strategic Plan for Combating Terrorism, military advisor to the vice president of the United States with a portfolio including terrorism and low intensity conflict Earlier Menarchik was instructor at the Air Force Special Operations School, teaching combating terrorism and counter insurgency But that s not all If you check Charles North s bio on USAID site, you will see a new updated ù version that excludes his National War College stint However, a cached copy of his true biography is still available and this snapshot shows the page as it appeared on September 14, 2012 Someone was cleaning house a few days before the public announcement Enough tales about healthcare dispensed by US military and national security cadre USAID out Russia must take care of its own civilsociety, ill and disabled by itself instead of outsourcing it to Washington Russia s shutting USAID operations is also an excellent example for any other country where USAID operatives still work on winning hearts and minds ù of the local population Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/usaid-security-russia-ngo-848/
"13 Jul, 2012",West's battle for Russian ‚Äòhearts and minds‚Äô: NGOs on steroids (Op-Ed),"The Russian Duma has just passed amendments to the Russian NGO law Russian NGOs receiving foreign funding will now have to register at the Ministry of Justice as an NGO carrying out functions as a foreign agent ù, make public their sources of funding by marking it on the materials they distribute, and report semi annually to the Ministry of Justice on their activities This law, a great majority of Russians believe, is long overdue In the past 25 years, billions of dollars have been pouring into Russia from the US State Department and its subsidiary agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID † nearly $3 billion alone), as well as from so called private foundations ù like the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, and George Soros s Open Society Institute All of these institutions, judging by their activities and leadership s biographies, have important ties to the US State Department, the intelligence community, Cold War and the color revolutions ù The goal of all this money was not to express Washington s generous love of Russia, its culture or its people In addition to building a loyal infrastructure, it aimed at winning hearts and minds ù and along the way oil, gas, and military capacity It has all been about opening ù open society ù, open economy ù, open Russia ù, open government ù open for brainwashing, economic plunder, for hijacking Russia s domestic and foreign policies Conquest by war is always an option for the US, as we have seen in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and now in Syria But victory without war ù is cheaper and more effective, as the collapse of Soviet Union has tragically shown What did Western funding do to the Russian civilsociety while pursuing military objectives by peaceful means ù? Might it have accidentally contributed to building democracy in Russia? The word democracy ù here is understood in its original sense, as government of the people for the people, not in Washington s interpretation as a loyal regime subservient to US interest In fact, the multibillions of Western funding have profoundly distorted Russian civilsociety A marginal pro American group of NGOs that was pumped up with US dollars like a bodybuilder with steroids it has gained much muscle and shine Those few Russians willing to serve foreign interests were provided nice offices, comfortable salaries, printing presses, training, publicity, and political and organizing technology which gave them far more capacity, visibility, and influence that they could possibly have had on their own Money and spin are the only means to promote unpopular ideas, alien to national interests On the other side is the silent majority of people who is squeezed out of the public space In Western, and also in Russian media, civilsociety turns out to be represented by Ludmila Alekseyeva (The Helsinki Group), Boris Nemtsov and Gary Kasparov, rather than by a worker from the Urals, teacher from Novosibirsk or a farmer from Krasnodar Region Moreover, Russian NGOs not addicted to Western funding are put under serious pressure from Western funders and their local outlets to join the club Once the Russian organization shows its effectiveness, its leadership receives a call from US Embassy, and an invitation to visit Money offers follow shortly If the Russian NGO dares to refuse the bait, one or several mirror organizations are created that, with massive funding and publicity, hijack the subject, fill it out with its agenda and occupy the field For projects in education, for example, suddenly it will be all Anglo Saxon models and values For projects fighting abuse by the police, this fight will be selective and serving to compile incriminatory evidence on loyal officials designed to create hostility to the government in general, rather than truly fighting these intolerable practices In the field of business associations, one Russian NGO was denounced by a major US allied corporation for excessively defending the rights of domestic producers ù No, Western funding does not contribute to strengthening Russian democracy It only extends the battle field for pro American forces against patriotic forces Like steroids, Western funding is injected in the weaker spots of the targeted civilsociety Like steroids, it is addictive Like steroids, it corrupts the mind and body of the political organism It transforms the target nation into a sick and dependent collaborating entity deprived of independent will, mind, and heart Russia and other countries subject to Western funding infusions must take charge of their domestic problems Building a patriotic civilsociety cannot be outsourced Democratic processes and national security cannot be outsourced all the more so to openly hostile governments These NGO amendments, by correcting an evident gap in our laws, take a major step in leveling the playing field But this step needs to be followed by further measures that strengthen our national civil societies Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-ngo-usa-funding-101/
"9 Jul, 2012",Washington‚Äôs new tricks on the road to global dominance (Op-Ed),"The latest round of the war against an independent Syria unfolded in Paris last week at the gathering of the Friends of Syria ù Russia and China very rightly did not attend this amoral ù in the diplomatic language of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting At the meeting western champions of the war insisted on their interpretation of the one week old Geneva agreements: transition government based on mutual consent ù means Bashar al Assad must go ù, affirmed French President Hollande This recent round of pressure highlights two new tactics employed by Washington: word games and an end run around the United Nations itself First, the new formula transition government ù The authoritative Merriam Webster dictionary defines regime ù as government ù and change ù as transition ù Thus, for those who reject regime change, ù a euphemism was created that has much better chances to go through Interestingly enough, this term was promoted by an expert of Russian origin, Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center On June 28, 2012 Trenin published a suggestion in his piece Syria: A Russian Perspective ù: Russia might be willing to cooperate with the U S and other countries if the goal moves towards transition ù rather than regime change ù † what has been dubbed the Yemen model ùSo who is Mr Trenin? This retired Soviet colonel was a Senior Research Fellow at the NATO Defense College in Rome just before he was recruited in 1993 to join the Carnegie Moscow Center, created the same year by none other than Michael McFaul, the current US Ambassador in Moscow After nearly 20 years in the pay of the Americans Trenin was rewarded with his current post as director by his former boss, Rose Gottemoeller, who left Moscow in 2008 to join the State Department where she is now Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Big shoes to fill for Mr Trenin, but in Washington they know how to pick their cadre The board of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington features this world is truly small Kofi Annan himself Among the Endowments Funders and Supporters ù are George Soros s Open Society Institute, the US National Intelligence Council, the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Defense Department, and a collection of other private and public enthusiasts Of course the transition government ù and Yemen model ù are nothing other than regime change ù Honestly: we, Russians, brought up on Tolstoy and Chekhov, should be able to miss Washington s elementary school semantic traps Secondly, unable to push anti Syrian resolutions through the UN Security Council due to Russia and China s staunch resistance, Washington is building up a group of more than hundred nations more pliable to US pressure Such coalitions of the willing ù have been put together before, but this time the number of countries makes it look like a parallel anti UN construct acting as if it is replacing the UN General Assembly itself Such a gathering, despite total absence of legitimacy, is not just a talking platform French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told Le Parisien ù that the Paris meeting would push for a Chapter VII United Nations resolution to enforce the transition plan A Chapter VII resolution can authorize the use of military force to maintain or restore international peace and security In the short term, the United States may attempt to institutionalize this ad hoc grouping into a mechanism to implement a final solution ù to President Al Assad In the long term, Washington may try to solidify such structure into an anti U N body of sycophants, ready and willing to approve any U S initiative Now, from tactics to strategy Looking at the type of leaders that are seizing power in the Arab world with American assistance, a normal person is perplexed: why does the United States, with assistance of their local satellites, keep on removing moderate secular governments and bringing to power, in one country after another, increasingly radical extremists that same type of people who committed 9/11, the greatest tragedy in U S post WWII history?Indeed, this question is not solvable by listening to Washington s official line of arguments But take a look at the policies of the US and its European partners during the in the 1930s Then, America and its ever so reasonable and civilized European allies provided the financial, industrial and political support encouraging the highly energized, violent extremist Nazi and fascist movements in Europe With a purpose: to direct its violence against Russia According to the plan, Germany and Russia were to exhaust themselves so that the US would emerge dominant Similarly, the earlier use of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and again today the encouragement of various Muslim extremists including elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are part of the plan to create a regional movement which could be thrown against Iran, Russia and China Such a furnace of war and chaos in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia will permanently disable all three of America s strategic rivals and allow Washington to rise to uncontested world domination †We should be able to decipher not only US language, but also US strategy In the 1930s, the Soviet Union was at the front line of the fight against Fascism in Europe Today, Russia owes it to its history and to the fallen in the anti fascist struggle to recognize and before it is too late avert American designs We must prevent Russian and other people from being drawn into a bloodbath of mutual extermination in the voracious interest of Washington s drive for global hegemony Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-syria-transition-721/
"16 Mar, 2009",'US uses Europe as a bridge-head to attack Eurasia',"The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics RT spoke to Graziani in Rome RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures It affects all levels of society In Italy we are seeing more support towards right wing anti immigration policies How can Italy and how can we all outlive the world financial crisis? Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and Japan This crisis has affected the whole world market As for Italy, the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010 Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium enterprises, there s no high concentration of industry, and therefore Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the crisis Anyway, the crisis will be very deep We ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a continental geo economic context It means that we should look for recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as Russia, China and India are going to have their part The crisis cannot be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in Brussels by the European Union only RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but still, it was among those taken hostage by it The truth has been concealed What is the real origin of the dispute? T G : The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as EU expansion into Eastern European countries These two coinciding enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close neighbourhood This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall From that moment the United States had decided to manage the whole planet They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it s known that Central Asia has huge resources of gas and oil The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its natural location, or from Moscow If we analyze the so called Orange Revolution , we ll realize that behind these achievements of the so called civilsociety of Ukraine were interests coming from across the Atlantic, from Washington We mustn t also forget about the influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian republics When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo political context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it s evident that when it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other Obviously gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine s leaders lack sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests Instead of looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas designated for European nations This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press, including the Italian press In the gas dispute, the majority of Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used geo policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal economic transactions concerning gas RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year T G : I believe it s possible to find an economic agreement Moscow and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts I d like to stress again that it s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and import It s a geopolitical issue It s evident, if Ukraine chooses to set up a Western camp with Washington s leadership, that ll affect not only gas, but also other economic issues as well Hence, I believe, it ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes from Kiev, because it depends on Washington s interests RT: While we re focusing on Washington let s talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here? T G : Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but they aren t politically conscious Thus, in the case of the enlargement of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main argument was environmental And the main motive was hidden as, in reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they d have the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in Serbia, which also depends on Washington In future it ll be possible to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia The Yugoslavian nation, Serbia in this case, wasn t chosen by chance, but because it has some cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia EU relations, many EU states are already looking for alternative suppliers Does Russia need to worry? T G : No, I don t think Russia should worry about it I think every country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning energy supplies and be self sufficient In a wider geo political context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe, between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests: exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources and, obviously, cultural relations I believe cultural relations between the European Union and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture If we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the 1930s we ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect language with many borrowed English words It is a result of cultural colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until today It s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in the countries of the former Soviet block RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia EU relations? T G : Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the European Union is a potential partner of I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London RT: You re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world anymore T G : I m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge head to attack the whole Eurasian ground It makes me critical, but, of course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over At present, in the 21st century, on a geo political level we have a multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some states in South America, which are also creating their own geo political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too In particular, major liberties which these South American countries enjoy can allow the European Union to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain RT: You travel all over Europe s hotspots and breakaway regions You were monitoring the election in Transdniester There is an island off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that s just declared independence, they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia Is there one universal formula on how to deal with separatism? T G : These issues are absolutely different In Sardinia there is a political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now As for Transdniester, it s necessary to view its situation from the geo strategic point of view The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel the weight of the United States and NATO Transdniester is one of the so called frozen conflicts I think Transdniester s independence would be interesting, because in this case it ll become an area the United States won t be able to enter It ll be a territory of liberty from the Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its sovereignty I don t analyze this republic judging it by its actual government I only analyze its geo strategic and geo political situation Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its small territory there are no NATO bases RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005‚Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/usa/us-uses-europe-as-a-bridge-head-to-attack-eurasia/
