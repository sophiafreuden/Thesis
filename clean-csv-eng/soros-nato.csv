"31 May, 2019",‚ÄòGold is more stable‚Äô: Malaysia needles US with proposal for pan-Asian bullion-backed currency,"Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad has floated the idea of creating a gold backed common trading currency for all of East Asia, slamming regional currency exchange as manipulative ù and criticizing the US s heavy handed foreign policy In the Far East, if you want to come together, we should start with a common trading currency, not to be used locally but for the purpose of settling of trade, ù Mahathirsaidat the Nikkei Future of Asia conference in Japan, suggesting the currency be based on gold because gold is much more stable ù and warning that promoting any one country s currency over others would result in conflict Exchange rates would be based on the country s economic performance and not subject to the volatility of forex markets Currency trading is not something that is healthy because it is not about the performance of countries but about manipulation, ù Mahathir added The gold backed currency would not be used within any one country, but would help protect regional trading from predatory speculators and from the vicissitudes of the dollar, which he said unfairly held the rest of the world hostage You [the US] are not democratic That is not for any single power to decide If you want to live in a united world, a stable world, we must resort to sustainability through agreement between all nations that have a stake in that problem ù Eventually, he said, the currency could be extended to other countries outside Asia Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump warned Malaysia that it could be placed on the US Treasury s list of currency manipulators ù and required close scrutiny, though Malaysia s central bank retorted that it maintains a floating exchange rate and strong external balance During the 1997 financial crisis, the bank pegged the ringgit to the dollar and imposed capital controls, but those measures were discontinued in 2005 Mahathir is a long time critic of the status quo in currency trading He blames billionaire financier George Soros for triggering the 1997 Asian financial crisis by betting against the ringgit and baht and has accused the financier of attempting to colonize ù Malaysia through his network of NGOs, claiming his end goal is regime change ù Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi proposed a pan African gold dinar that would be used to sell the country s oil on the world market in 2009, less than two years before his government fell to a NATO backed regime change operation that has left the once prosperous nation a conflict ridden warzone One of the moderate rebels first actions upon brutally murdering Gaddafi was to create a central bank to replace the state owned monetary authority that had previously managed Libya s wealth The US has historically not taken kindly to countries that attempted to trade oil in non dollar currencies, as Iraq s Saddam Hussein can attest or could, if he hadn t been regime changed as well Syria, too, dropped its peg to the dollar in 2007, not long before the West went from awarding Bashar al Assad the French medal of honor to declaring him a bloodthirsty monster ",https://www.rt.com/business/460698-malaysia-proposes-gold-forex-currency/
"24 May, 2019",West-backed think tanks threaten new Ukrainian president with disturbing list of ‚ÄòRED LINES‚Äô,"When President Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide victory in the free and undisputed April elections, most accepted that he was given a fairly strong mandate to lead Ukraine But it seems not everyone is so democratically minded Particularly unmoved by the democratic process are a collection of Ukrainian civilsociety groups, who have just issued alengthy listof red lines not to be crossed ùby the new president, lest he risk provoking a new wave of political instability that they would presumably instigate Issuing their catalog of demands on Thursday, the groups claim to be politically neutral ùbut deeply concerned ùabout the first actions taken by the comedian turned politician Zelensky, including his decision to appoint members of former President Viktor Yanukovych s government to positions within his own government Various civilsociety groups in#Ukrainehave issued a list of red lines that they don t want president@ZelenskyyUato cross, saying there ll be unrest if he does It s the longest list of red lines I ve ever seen Twittosphere, what do you make of it?https:// tdotco /jgHAIIAciS A scan of the undersigned reveals that many of these civilsociety groups ùare anything but politically neutral In fact, quite a few of them are partly funded by the US government, various EU governments (including the UK), the European Commission itself and, of course, the omnipresent liberal billionaire George Soros The list includes the notorious Euromaidan Press, Stop Fake and Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, to name just a few In their heyday, many of these groups acted as propaganda tools of the Western backed government of Petro Poroshenko, rather than the watchdogs they claim to be They now confirm that a pesky election isn t going to stand in the way of their agenda, reaffirming that their own principles and positions ùon issues remain unchanged and warning: Should [Zelensky] cross these red lines, such actions will inevitably lead to political instability in our country This statement, which precedes the wide ranging list of red lines, reads like a threat: Do what we say, or there will be trouble Isn t that a strange, almost dictatorial approach for groups purporting to be interested in democracy, freedom, and dignity ù?Did we all miss the part where a group of think tanks were collectively elected president of Ukraine? This list of demands by western funded Ukraine NGOs îthreatening to overthrow Zelenskiy if he doesn t follow their demands îperfect example of Arundhati Roy s critique of civilsociety as an elite construct designed to subvert & control popular democracyhttps:// tdotco /j33iGoSqOA Of course, these groups do indeed represent various factions of Ukrainian society and many of them no doubt have worthy aims, and they should continue their work unimpeded But they do not represent all of Ukrainian society and they certainly do not have the authority to set the political agenda and lay down the law to the incoming government and that, quite literally, is what they are trying to do It s such a gobsmackingly odd list of demands that even Western journalists who had a broadly friendly relationship with the Poroshenko government are aghast at their audacity The list is broken down into issues of security, foreign policy, economy, national identity (language, education and culture), media and government functioning On security, the groups want to forbid Zelensky from achieving compromise with Russia in any manner that would be to the detriment of the national interest, presumably as defined by themselves Inhibiting the implementation of security and defense policies outlined in a 2016 decree signed by Poroshenko is also forbidden, they say do these cronies not know how democracy works, or just not care? Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda they don t get to continue setting it like the election never happened In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the reduction or lifting of sanctions on Russia by Western powers He may not take any action delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with the IMF and other foreign partners It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review ù multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious de communization ù which banned Soviet symbols in the country Ironically, this push for de communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy The NGOs ùinsist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another red line among their national identity demands Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian? Well, Zelensky will also be in big trouble if he tries to restore them, the civilsociety groups ùsay READ MORE: Reality bites: Ukraine s President Zelensky puts showbiz pals in positions of real power The most vague red line of all comes near the end of the list, when the new president is warned against ignoring dialogue with civilsociety ù a command so vague that almost anything ùZelensky does going forward could be interpreted as ignoring their wishes, France 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg wrote on Twitter BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher tweeted that the groups themselves may have crossed a red line †the red line of what civilsociety groups can legitimately demand of a freshly elected government I feel like almost anything he does could be interpreted as crossing one or other of those lines, they re so wide ranging It reads like a manifesto there s an election in 2 months Make a party see if anyone agrees with you that s democracy Zelensky was elected to office with 73 percent of the vote and let s not forget, he won that election having campaigned against many of the policies these civilsociety groups are aggressively demanding be kept in place He has been in office only a matter of days, and these Western backed groups are threatening to instigate political unrest should he take any action that they don t find acceptable to their political agenda So who, exactly, poses the real threat to democracy?

"22 May, 2019",Is Soros-linked Avaaz group a credible source on fake news? Mainstream media seems to think so,"Mainstream news outlets have eagerly reported on a study by the Avaaz campaign group, claiming far right disinformation groups have been spreading fake news in the lead up to EU elections î but is the group all that it seems? The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing people powered politics to decision making everywhere ùand it s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far right and anti EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right wing and anti establishment groups and parties î and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial Be like Captain Von Trapp reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23 26!pic twitter com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls î but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon org (which has been partly funded by left wing Hungarian American billionaire George Soros) î and its co founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context? Independent journalists have had suspicions about Avaaz s own activity for years, noting its strong pro establishment and globalist leanings, which have even translated into outward support for US regime change wars around the world When the group is notpushingfor no fly zones in LibyaandSyria, oragitatingfor regime change in Venezuela and Iran, it is actively supporting centrist, neoliberal political figures across the EU and US Patel told the EUobserver last year that the majority ùof people across Europe stand with ùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and has also activelysupportedFrench President Emmanuel Macron with online videos and petitions While Avaaz is seemingly very concerned with the plight of citizens in places like Venezuela and Iran (it was also activelyinvolvedin promoting Iran s Green Revolution in 2009), it appears to be less concerned with the lives of ordinary Europeans The group has targeted the anti Macron Yellow Vest movement in France and †framed the protesters easy targets for spreading fake news ù î and to put the icing on the cake, blamed the swift spread of this alleged fake news on Russia, another of Avaaz s favorite targets Indeed, unsurprisingly, media reporting on so called election meddling ahead of EU elections has taken on an anti Russia hue, with many suggesting that disinformation groups are simply copying Russian tactics from the 2016 US election, when the democraticparty claimed Russian disinformation campaigns were a major factor in Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump î a claim for which there remains exactly zero evidence One of these reports on the alleged copycat tactics quotes Ben Nimmo, a former NATO press officer, cited with regularity by mainstream journalists as though he is an impartial source Like clockwork, Nimmo popped up ahead of the EU elections to claim that domestic actors ùacross Europe are now simply doing what the Russians had already been doing ù î because it s easier to blame Russia for social discord in Europe than failed leadership and unpopular policies Once again, it appears that many of the groups claiming to help people recognize fake news online are some of the biggest and sneakiest purveyors of disinformation themselves î and they are frequently promoted by mainstream news outlets î if they are selling the correct narrative, that is Mainstream media continue to quote the founders of cybersecurity firm New Knowledge as credible experts on Russian disinformation tactics, even after the firm wasexposedby the New York Times for having run its own disinformation campaign during a 2017 Alabama senate race The New Knowledge crowd set up fake Russian social media accounts to support one candidate and then worked to publicly brand him as Moscow s pick By not even mentioning Avaaz s own sketchy links, and very clear political leanings, Western news reports citing its studies as completely credible and independent are simply engaging in their own kind of disinformation ",https://www.rt.com/news/460010-avaaz-eu-elections-disinformation/
"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary‚Äôs FM: We didn‚Äôt get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People s Party, the center right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps://soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation SS: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news So, the bloc of the centre right parties in the European Parliament, the European People s Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? PS: Look, because Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the europeanunion as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that s why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs And our position is a very strong anti migration position, which is not shared by many And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements So that s why this is the core of the conflict SS: That s where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you re saying it s much larger of a spectrum, not just centre right, because we get an impression that it s a center right bloc Ok, so that makes sense PS: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament And if you, let s say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you And we have to be honest, European People s Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be SS: So, this suspension happened, took place The head of your Prime Minister s office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP What s going on right now? PS: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People s Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let s put it this way And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP SS: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn t take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote PS: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself SS: So that means, that if it wasn t voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? PS: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow SS: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend PS: Yeah We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing SS: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? PS: No no no We shouldn t confuse the party issue with, let s say, institutional questions The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the europeanunion , like a cash machine, you know, and don t take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair SS: So you re saying the payouts are not under threat? PS: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well So it s a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long lasting debate or legal procedure SS: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti migrant policy that your country s leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we ve all seen Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? PS: No, no definitely not Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that s going to be the case in the future as well And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don t want that to happen So it s a debate with him, an open debate He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him And my question is, why shouldn t a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary SS: Okay, so let s see how the forces could be re arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro EU, and now it s kind of siding with Italy against Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? PS: Look, I don t think it s fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the europeanunion SS: Integration, let s put it this way PS: Yeah, yeah, right There s a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward And there are definitely at least two different camps One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels We think it s a dead end street We think this is a bad concept We think that this will not strengthen europeanunion What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro European position, as we think that the way towards a strong europeanunion leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong So the debate is rather about that, and that s why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong europeanunion , but we think that SS: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it s not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you re all part of europeanunion , you want to be part of europeanunion , but, like you said, there s definitely two camps One is super pro integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro stronger state and a formal Brussels, let s put it this way So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you ve suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? PS: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we ll see how we go forward But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro migration body And this is something that we don t like SS: So you re leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU s border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation This is a serious accusation PS: These are facts, basically SS: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? PS: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border Let s look at the Internet, at what they have said You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it s not a border protection unit They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together But protecting the entire border to the South of the europeanunion with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn t know what he or she speaks about We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended SS: Ok, so I m going to play a little bit of devil s advocate, and I m going to tell you what the opposite side is saying The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they re saying it s ludicrous, and it s a conspiracy theory, and they re actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you re not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it s under threat? I just want to hear that PS:Whether the borders are under threat? SS: Do you feel like you re not in control of your own border? PS:We are in control That s why we have built the fence That s why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis A number of them So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border But, you know, it s really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together We think it s a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states SS:So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered PS:Absolutely SS:That s your country as well PS:But this cannot be our country It s physically excluded SS:OK But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary PS:But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary either Greece or Greece and Croatia Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, was that we registered them, and the Greek didn t But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one SS:Another thing Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? PS:Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament Then we don t know the composition of that We don t know the composition of the European Commission So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the europeanunion , what we see is a huge set of double standards Why? Take the example of Poland The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made They completed all of them from A to Z And what European Commission has done was saying Äúoh, it s not enough, we continue the procedure Äù instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations SS:So I want to talk a little about Hungary s stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that s something that your country speaks very strongly about For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the europeanunion If that happens, if the pro immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? PS:No, absolutely not That s not in question SS:So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe s population was Muslim And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far fetched, no? He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different PS:Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti anything So we are not anti Muslim We are not anti anything We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent You know, it s unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn t be the case Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo Christian heritage, with its Christian culture And in this regard, I think it s very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate SS:I know you don t like Frontex, but I m still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? PS:You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the europeanunion , mostly in the Southern and Southern Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe I was in Jordan recently The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom Lebanon the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there The last time the Turkish President has complained about the europeanunion not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU Turkey deal on migration As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats they ll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing I mean, on the level of europeanunion , we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the europeanunion is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe SS:Okay, I get your point Now to a different topic the Russian led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans What s the calculus behind it? What s the logic? PS:Look, now the situation started to change So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute IIB s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension So new and modern investments are happening in the country We are looking for financial background So IIB s involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us SS:But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank It s a normal, usual practice with this international institutions But the Western commentators are saying that actually it s a great base for Russia s intelligence services to operate from What do you say to that?

And how is it respectful of others freedom and sovereignty to impose values on them at gunpoint? The declaration creates more questions than it purports to answer The seven point platform pays lip service to freedom and justice, democracy and self determination, peace and security, free markets and equal opportunity ùIt also demands of signatories to support an open global economy ù Point Four somehow managed to advocate for private property and capitalism as well as welfare state and open borders, asserting the right to own property, purchase goods and services, and invest in free and open markets ùas well as free and fair flow of trade and investment ù but also demanding of governments to facilitate access to food, water, shelter, medical services, and educationfor their own citizens and others in need ù(emphasis added) Point Five also talks about an open and healthy planet ùin vague terms that combine overarching global environmentalism and migration across only nominally controlled borders The true gem is Point Six, the right of assistance ùthat would require governments to allow their citizens to receive assistance from others to advance these principles, including, in non free societies, support to non violent groups, political parties, and individuals aiming to foster democracy or human rights ùbut also the signatories to intervene where governments or other actors are unwilling or unable to cease or remedy flagrant or systematic violations ù Who would define non free societies ù? Why of course, the signatories of the Atlantic Council declaration! The commitment to peace and security in Point Three asks the signatories to refrain from the use of force,except as just and necessary to advance these principles ù(emphasis added) The devil is in the details, as they say in this case, in that qualifying clause There is a massive amount of hypocrisy in the US and its allies advocating for free markets and open flow of goods and services, while being the world s leading source of sanctions, blacklists and blockades against those who resist their demands Likewise, the notion of initiating force in order to promote the values of this declaration is a total mockery of values advocated by the champions of modern democracy though it might be easily recognizable to ancient Athenians, who demanded the surrender of Melos with the argument that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must ù Perhaps the most pernicious notion in the declaration, however, is that it expands the duty to uphold its values from governments to private entities and individuals where they are able ùIt is not hard to see how this is a direct attempt to lend legitimacy to the legion of quasi NGOs backed by Western governments and their philanthropist ùhitmen like George Soros There is only one tiny little problem with this: it upends the entire international order based on the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which gave governments the monopoly on force within their territory The preceding Thirty Years War had seen much of Europe devastated by a conflict that started as a dynastic dispute only to spiral into a religious war characterized by widespread massacres and atrocities committed by official militaries as much as militias and mercenaries üö® We will defend our values, overcome past failures with new ideas, answer lies with truth, confront aggression with strength, and go forward with the confidence that our principles will prevail Join us #DefendDemocracyRead#ACDeclarationhere:https:// tdotco /JOy6l14nSnpic twitter com/GGFmbvCa6e Looking at the committee that drafted this declaration, it becomes clear why it seeks to legitimize the lawlessness of the post Cold War behavior by the bombers of Yugoslavia, invaders of Iraq, and regime changers of Libya Among the co chairs of the drafting commission are former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former George W Bush national security advisor Stephen Hadley, uniting the neoliberals and neoconservatives around the idea of a US led global hegemony The list of former government officials who signed the declaration also reads as a who s who of US empire boosters, from former NATO GenSec Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Denmark) to former foreign ministers Tzipi Livni (Israel), Radek Sikorski (Poland), and David Miliband and Malcolm Rifkind Labour and Tory, respectively of the UK Other notable names include Munich Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger, former deputy FM of Germany, as well as former Australian FM Alexander Downer, best known for his 2016 role in claiming Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was somehow connected to the phantom Trump Russia collusion ù The world could do worse than to take their declarations with a large chunk of salt Nebojsa Malic, RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/451783-atlantic-council-declaration-revisionist/

a tome which insists Stalin had been secretly plotting an offensive against Hitler s Germany but first he wanted Hitler to destroy democracy in Europe, in the manner of an icebreaker, thereby clearing the way for world communism In other words, not the version you learned at school Except, surprise, surprise, this statement on Suvorov s book isn t true As †one scholarpointed out, while demanding a correction from Harding, it s more accurate to say the opposite is the case Indeed, †the scholarreferenced, Suvorov s argument was rapidly countered by much of the established Russian historical community, including Dmitry Volkogonov, with the support of Western historians We ve been here before with Harding He s repeatedly weaved fantastical stories about Russia, and other subjects, for years But, as the legendary ex Moscow hack Mark Amesobserves literally nothing Harding publishes, no matter how demonstrably false and reckless, will ever hurt his journalism career He s a Made Man Guardian hack Luke Harding was caught plagiarizing me,@yashalevine& others îand it had zero effect on his career advancement If his latest scoop ù on Manafort/Assange is debunked, there will be zero consequences Most of us still can t fully grasp thishttps:// tdotco /8AeD8GRXh0 And, while he s an especially blatant example, Harding is not alone in this Because on the Russia beat, it seems Western journalists can pretty much get away with any transgressions, without suffering career damage Instead, paradoxically, it often seems to even lead to professional progression Today, you hear a lot of hysteria concerning Russian disinformation in the West, but little or nothing, in mainstream media, on disinformation about Russia, something this writer has tried to cover in recent years And it s a lonely beat Indeed, as the Canadian academic Paul Robinson rightly notes, while there s a huge army of well funded institutions and individuals now devoted to uncovering and countering Russian disinformation, there seems to be little or no accountability for the false stories produced by Western sources (on Russia) And the examples are legion With even the most heinous fakes failing to amount to any sort of setback for their promoters Which suggests editors are more than happy to indulge the practice, because after all it s only Russia and everyone knows Russia is bad Here are a few selected lowlights Numerous other examples exist but more are hardly needed to show how there seems to be no penalty for getting Russia wrong in Western media And, on the contrary, it s hardly a conspiracy theory to suggest it s actively encouraged Which means, of course, disinformation about Russia is far more common, organized and influential than notional Russian disinformation Particularly on social networks, but prevalent too in supposedly respectable media READ MORE: The only Russian bots to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat linked experts Nevertheless, don t hold your breath waiting for the usual think tank info war chancers to issue reports, dripping with condemnation Because this isn t about delivering truth in the news, it s about keeping control of the narrative ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/448320-western-media-rewards-fake-news/

As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his opensociety Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East? Soros has an answer for that as well He calls it surge funding, ù which entails raising a substantial amount of debt backed by the EU s relatively small budget ù George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Any guesses who will be forced to pay down the debt on this high risk venture? If you guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the europeanunion , is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it @Robert_Bridge",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/447686-globalists-soros-france-protests/

"12 Nov, 2018","Criminal war, poverty at the heart of European & US migration turmoil","Europe has certainly adopted more fortress like controls against would be refugees A concomitant rise in anti immigrant political parties has in turn fueled popular resentment towards EU institutions is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others But the debate requires much more than moral appeals ù A recentstudyentitled Building Walls puts the growth of EU internal and external border barriers into stark perspective In the 1990s, there were two border walls Now the number has grown to a total of 17, with most of the structures built over the past three years Ten countries out of 28 EU member states have built physical barriers to control migrants entering from outside the bloc They include Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Latvia The authors of the above report call the structures edifices of fear ù and make the startling comparison to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany until its dismantlement in 1989 EU states have built border barriers equivalent to the length of six Berlin Walls The report also reproaches the proliferation of mental walls ù across EU member states with the rise of what it calls far right ù and racist ù political parties There are now, it is claimed, 10 EU states in which xenophobic ù parties have significant government or parliamentary representation However, the problem with a report like this is that it provides no practical solutions to the immense political and social challenges stemming from phenomenal migration The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that a record number of 68 5 million people worldwide are forcibly on the move from their origins, many of them trying to reach Europe We can perhaps agree that in recent years that the EU has faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443776-migratns-poverty-war-eu-soros/

Only one Peter Kreko, director of the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank, ùwho is concerned Orban s moves help Russia hamper Ukraine s Euro Atlantic integration ù Now, isn t that a weird sort of thing for a Hungarian analyst to be worrying about? Well, it wouldn t be if the LA Times were transparent and disclosed Kreko s funding You see, here s who bankrolls the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank ù Institute of Modern Russia (plaything of disgraced former 90 s oligarch and Putin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky) National Endowment For Democracy (a US neoconservative outlet dedicated to regime change ùand promoting a pro US outlook in Eastern Europe, whose chair has dubbed Ukraine the big prize ù) opensociety (George Soros, who needs no introduction) And here are some of the most important international and domestic professional partners ùof the Political Capital Institute: Atlantic Council (NATO s propaganda wing) European Values (a Soros funded Prague lobby group which smeared hundreds of European public figures as useful idiots ùfor appearing on RT Including Jeremy Corbyn and Stephen Fry) German Marshall Fund of the United States (proprietors of the infamous Hamilton 68 dashboard) Thus, the agendas at play are pretty clear here Yet, the LA Times keeps its readers ignorant of Kreko s paymasters Which is especially interesting when you see RT, almost always, referred to as the Kremlin funded Russia Today, ùor some version thereof, when described in Western media And this is fine, because it s true, but when the same rules don t apply across the board, the bias is obvious The second case comes courtesy of the Rupert Murdoch controlled Times of London ù(see what I did there?) This week, it alleged around75,000Russians in London alone are Kremlin informants All based on an investigation ùby the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a neoconservative pressure group which seems to have successfully mounted a reverse takeover of the once venerable paper With its leader writer, for instance, being a founding signatory of theconcern Anyway, HJS, apparently based on a mere 16 interviews, with unnamed sources, concluded that between a quarter and a half of Russian expats were, or have been informants ùAnd the Times splashed it However, it clarified, ùwith comment from an anonymous dissident, ùhow, in reality, it was about half ùSo, only the 32,500 odd agents in London then Which, if true, would means the walls of the Russian Embassy would have to be made from elastic to house the amount of handlers required to keep tabs on their information sources Look, it s hardly a secret that standards at the Times are low After all, the main foreign affairs columnist, Edward Lucas, is literally funded by US weaponsmanufacturers No, this is not a joke Lucas is employed as a lobbyist at CEPA, a Washington and Warsaw based outfit, which promotes the arms manufacturer s agenda in Central and Eastern Europe Namely, thelikesof Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, FireEye, and Bell Helicopters Of course, The Times doesn t make this conflict of interests clear to its readers Another example of how the think tank tail is wagging the mainstream media dog these days ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443540-think-tanks-media-disinformation/
"27 Oct, 2018","Republicans & Democrats may bark and bite, but the migrant caravan moves on","On the eve of midterms, thousands of migrants are streaming towards the US through Mexico with dreams of entering America The crisis has turned into a slippery political football in a coliseum called Washington Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge For those of us living cozy, self indulgent lives, complete with cappuccino mornings and cocktail sunsets, it is hard to imagine a level of economic deprivation so severe it could actually force people to pack their bags and trek thousands of miles in search of some semblance of happiness Yet that is exactly what is happening now as an estimated 10,000 poverty stricken migrants, the majority from Honduras, have set off on a modern day odyssey in the hope of reaching the Promised Land, where potholes are filled with gold and cotton candy hangs heavy from trees But what has made this march particularly sensational is that it is happening at the most pivotal moment as far as American politics is concerned Obsessed with the upcoming midterm elections, the Democrats and Republicans are piling on the emergency like a fumbled ball, trying to use the crisis to win extra points before November 6th Such political maneuvering sees both parties occasionally flip flopping on their platforms or twisting information for the purpose of gaining an edge In fact, many Americans would probably be surprised to know that under the leadership of Barack Obama, the Democrats who havecomparedTrump to Hitler over his efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border deporteda whopping 2 5 million undocumented people from the United States by 2015 Equally surprising is that under the tenure of Obama s Republican predecessor, George W Bush, the Republicans deported just 2 million undocumented people And then there was Hillary Clinton On the campaign trail in 2007, shetolda rally the federal government is supposed to set immigration policy ù That comment should have carried a footnote that reads, Unless you are Donald Trump In other words, in this brutal political game, the goalposts continuously shift to accommodate the changing winds Meanwhile, the GOP is also guilty of its own false starts Indeed, many Republicans view the timing of this massive movement of people as more than just a coincidence, looking to borderline conspiracy theories to explain it I agree with President Obama 100%!pic twitter com/PI3aW1Zh5Q Last week, for example, Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz tweeted out a video that shows a long line of women, many of them holding children, accepting cash from two young men Gaetz assumed that the video was made in Honduras, but in fact it showed the migrants somewhere in Guatemala on their way towards Mexico Although he got the location wrong which he lateracknowledged the video succeeds in raising far more questions than answers Gaetz could not resist dropping the name of George Soros, the billionaire bugbear of the political right who provides funding for a long list of political and civic groups BREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time Soros? US backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!pic twitter com/5pEByiGkkN One such group that has benefited from Soros financial support is the non profit organization, Skylight, which is embedded with the caravan for the stated purpose of filming the migration In 2016, the group received a 1 million dollar contribution by Foundation to Promote opensociety (2016 tax return, page 287, Skylight Engagement Inc ) Although this does not necessarily prove anything untold is happening, Skylight s presence in the caravan has raised some eyebrows among Republicans opensociety denies any involvement in assisting the migrants on their journey Video taken by our crew on the ground with the#HonduranCaravanshowing thousands of migrants making their way into Mexico at the#Mexico/#Guatemalaborder üá¨üáπ üá≤üáΩ üé•#MigrarEsUnDerecho#CaravanadeMigrantes#Skylightpic twitter com/fP4KgKKEvE This is a monumental undertaking, and already the march is taking its toll Mexican officials say 1,740 migrants have applied for asylum and hundreds more have taken up offers of bus rides back to Honduras, ù APreported Whatever the case may be, Trump is urging Mexico to crackdown on the marching migrants before they reach the US border The US leader s uneasiness about the situation is understandable In the event that even a fraction of the migrants reach the US border before the midterms, it would place the Republicans in a tricky predicament If the US National Guard, for example, is forced to push back against migrant women and children (who will certainly be sent to the front of the receiving line for maximum visuals) it may spell disaster for the Republicans in the midterms Such stark images will conjure up memories of Trump s failed zero tolerance immigration policy that separated children from their parents at the border, as well as the misconception that Trump is somehow a racist for wanting to build a wall on the Mexican border Now two days in a row Happening all over again pic twitter com/r1RYRnbF0n On the other hand, the image of thousands of migrants storming the US border might get Republicans off the couch and to the polls in record numbers At the same time, other Trump supporters will be asking, yet again, why the wall Trump promised to buildremainsa pipe dream Such questions could ultimately work to the Republicans advantage, in that the Democrats have vigorously opposed most Republican projects to date, not least of all the border wall Ironically, however, had the Democrats performed this simple construction task during Barack Obama s two term presidency, Trump, who built his campaign on the promise of protecting America s border, would most likely never have had the rallying cry he needed to become president Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on@foxandfriendsthat the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border MUST BE CHANDED, but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency They will be stopped! At this point, I would like to say that, as an American, it is difficult to fathom how the question of a strong border has become such a political football The United States has a very fair system for allowing people to become naturalized citizens, and asylum seekers are accorded all the protections mandated by the law The only requirement is that migrants follow the legal procedures for entry, and if that sounds like a radical or xenophobic idea, as many Liberals today seem to believe, then the majority of countries in the world would have to be classified as racist Somehow the US went from being an ethnically diverse country comprised of law abiding immigrants, to a nation that thinks it s alright to accept law breaking border jumpers as future citizens In times past, before the age of virtue signaling, social justice warriors and PC dementia was all the rage, a group of undocumented people storming the US border would have been dealt with in the appropriate manner, and without any questions asked Today, however, many Western governments have been infected by the globalist creed, Merkel style, that says it is the duty of Western democracies to let oppressed migrants into their countries en masse and unmolested Meanwhile, it is the migrants who areportrayedas heroes in the Western media, while the people who want to defend their borders are some sort of knuckle dragging xenophobes In the case of the europeanunion , countries that fight back against the concept of loose borders, like Hungary, for example, are treated like pariah states, even suffering severe disciplinary action The situation is so grave and arouses so many different emotions that the issue of borders actually has the power to break up the West into two camps the nationalists on one side and the globalists on the other When one looks a bit deeper at the situation, the Liberal desire to accept migrants with open arms is dripping with hypocrisy and not a little blood After all, if the Democrats (and Republicans) really wanted to address the problem of mass migration at the root they would be out on the streets demanding that their governments cease and desist from waging war on sovereign states That is the real reason why so many people are fleeing their homes for a new life military aggression It s a national embarrassment that a group of illegal immigrants can cross our border and receive free healthcare/benefits, while veterans that have served this country are put on a waiting list Even tiny Honduras is no stranger to such violence This is something the Democrats should understand given former president Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton s botched efforts toinfluencethe Honduras military coup of 2009 In fact, that event, which brought to power a far right strongman, Pepe Lobo Sosa, goes far at explaining the caravan now ascending upon the US border In short, if the West would simply stop pursuing war and chaos around the world, much of which is based on avarice and empire building, the question of stronger borders would no longer be an issue, and those innocent people now in the firing line of NATO armies could rest easily knowing they can build prosperous lives in their own countries @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442423-migrants-caravan-midterms-crisis/

"4 Oct, 2018",The military-industrial-humanitarian complex: Spreading Western hegemony under the guise of virtue,"Shakespeare once wrote that the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose Nowadays, we see the terms humanitarian and democracy abused to justify death and destruction Traditionally honorable words such as humanitarian and democracy have come to acquire a darker and more cynical meaning following their misappropriation to justify the invasion of sovereign nations and to promote the spread of Western military and cultural dominance across the globe The mainstream media, alongside some human rights activists, assist these ventures by helping disseminate mistruths and by tapping into the emotions of fear, anger and revulsion to soften public opinion and make aggression against a sovereign state appear justified Running parallel to politicians lies that Saddam Hussein possessed WMD deployable within 45 minutes, a strategy was deployed to shock and awe the public into accepting the invasion through attention grabbing headlines crafted to abhor readers with evidence of Saddam s butchery and to generate strong emotional reactions which would cause people to think with their hearts rather than their heads One such story written by Labour MP Ann Clwyd and published inThe Timesjust two days before the US led Coalition of the Willing began destroying Iraq, asserted that Saddam possessed a human shredding machine into which adversaries were fed feet first and turned into fish food The article, titled See men shredded, then say you don t back war, ùhad the double effect of causing the reader to feel revulsion and of making the anti war lobby appear callous and indifferent to the plight of the Iraqi people The existence of a human shredder was laterchallengedand such a machine has yet to be found Saddam s real crimes were known to USintelligenceservices, who informed him about the locations of Iranian troops during the Iran Iraq war in the 1980s, in the knowledge that he would use mustard gas and sarin against them The US also provided Saddam withclusterbombs and helped him acquire chemical precursor agents US based Human Rights Watch estimated that Saddam killed at least290,000of his own people while in power † However, this figure is dwarfed by the number of Iraqis believed to have died in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, due to occupation forces, sectarian violence or ISIS this figure isestimatedto be in the hundreds of thousands, if not in excess of a million The psychological shock and awe strategy was again employed in the lead up to NATO s bombing of Libya, as the US and UK s on offrelationshipwith Gaddafi took a turn for the worse after he planned to start selling oil in dinars (a new gold backed pan African currency) instead of US dollars or euros, and encouraged his African neighbors to follow suit The release of Hillary Clinton s emails in late 2015 revealed that such a move would havestrengthenedAfrican economies and led to competition between the dinar and the dollar or euro On this occasion, we were treated to the excuse that bombing Libya and supporting the anti Gaddafi rebels, including Al Qaeda affiliatedelements, was necessary as Gaddafi was about to commit amassacreagainst the people of the rebel controlled city of Benghazi Another emotive claim designed to mould public opinion into accepting the war affirmed that Gaddafi was giving his soldiers Viagra so they could commit mass rape An investigation by Amnesty International found no evidence to support this allegation and revealed that on several occasions anti Gaddafi forces in Benghazi hadmadefalse allegations or manufactured evidence of human rights violations Gaddafi was overthrown and one of the richest and most stable countries in Africa became a failed and lawless state controlled by a mishmash of rebel groups, some affiliated or sympathetic to Al Qaeda These groupsbeganto persecute, imprison and murder Sub Saharan Africans on a mass scale, many of whom had come to Libya as economic migrants, accusing them of loyalty to Gaddafi Furthermore, Libya s destruction triggered a war in neighboring Mali and helped strengthen Al Qaeda and ISIS in North Africa Some of the anti Gaddafi rebels would later find their wayto Syria The same script was used in relation to Syria as Western politicians, along with their media and activist allies, worked hard to drum up public support for removing the country s president from power In 2013, the emotions of Western audiences were targeted with claims that Assad had used sarin against civilians, meaning his removal from power needed to be acted on without delay The allegation remains unproven and a UN led inquiry later indicated that anti governmentrebelsthemselves may have been responsible for the attack †The claims that Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people seem to surface whenever the Syrian government regains large amounts of territory from rebel or jihadist forces President Assad has been blamed for causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in a conflict forced upon Syria where Saudi Arabia and Qatar (among other states) havefunded and armedrebels that Western intelligence agencies consider moderate WikiLeaks haspublisheddiplomatic cables in which US politicians expressed concern that Saudi Arabian donors were sending money and weapons to groups such as Al Nusra Front (also known as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda) and ISIS Syrian opposition activists claim that as of September 2018 an estimated164,336to522,000people (depending which anti Assad group you ask) have been killed since the conflict began in 2011 Although the Syrian opposition and their Western and Gulf state supporters are quick to blame President Assad for these deaths, those killed include Syrian soldiers and pro government militias who died defending their country from moderate (and not so moderate) rebels backed by Syria s enemies, as well as civilians killed by these rebel groups When Russia came to Syria s aid in September 2015, at the request of the country s government, to assist in the fight against ISIS, Al Nusra and other rebel groups, it faced criticism from the Western media and Syrian opposition groups who accused Russia of propping up a dictator something of which the UK and US have much experience Presumably the US and its allies desire to overthrow Assad was worth the risk of ISIS continuing its march of terror and destruction across Syria until its flags flew over Damascus The barrage of attacks against Russia intensified in 2016 when the nation provided Syrian troops with air support in their campaign to retake Aleppo,formerlythe country s largest city and financial and industrial hub, from a range of rebel groupincludingAl Nusra Front and a number of non Syrian jihadist fighters Newspapers across the political spectrum shed crocodile tears about the number of civilians and babies killed in the Russian bombing, presumably forgetting that the children of Gaza and Yemen are no less immortal when it comes to aerial bombardment The Western media chooses where to direct its audiences emotions Thediscreditedorganization known as the White Helmets, which receivesfundingfrom the US and several European governments, injected an additional dose of pathos into the mix, showing what they claimed were pictures and videos of their members pulling children and civilians from the rubble in Aleppo Thecontroversiessurrounding this group have been well documented Then we saw another media darling, seven year old Syrian girl Bana al Abed, allegedlytweetingpleas for Western intervention,including Dear world, it s better to start 3rd world war instead of letting Russia & assad commit #HolocaustAleppo, ùthough it s questionable whether she produced such tweets without adult assistance The US based Human Rights Watch, which hasreceivedmillions of dollars from billionaire George Soros, cited a report from a Syrian opposition group stating that446civilians were killed by Russian and Syrian planes during the battle for Aleppo in the month of September to October 2016 Elsewhere, Human Rights Watchcitesthe UK basedpro oppositionSyrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claims that airstrikes by the US led coalitionkilled1,064 civilians, including 248 children, during the battle of Raqqa between early June September 20, 2017 Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the populations of Aleppo and Raqqa in 2016 and 2017 respectively, as of 2018 Aleppo s population numbers 1 6 million; while Raqqa s is 61,000 Each civilian death is a tragedy in its own right, regardless of whether it is caused by American, Russian, Syrian or any other nation s aircraft However, it must be acknowledged that only Russia and Iran intervened in the Syrian conflict at the request of the nation s legitimate government All other nations involving themselves in the Syrian conflict are in breach of international law and warrant expulsion from Syrian territory Due to Russia s intervention, Syria will now not go the way of Iraq or Libya and is on the path to again becoming a united and stable nation with a secular and diverse identity This is one intervention which prevented the destruction of a nation and saved millions from the unimaginable nightmare of life under ISIS or similar groups This is the opposite of the Western approach, by which a unified nation is plunged into anarchy and the terrorists appear only after the humanitarian intervention has

So far, the evidence suggest that there is indeed plenty for the left to worry about when it comes to corporations like Facebook and Twitter and their alliances with government censors 1 Facebook censorship of Venezuelan news In May, Facebook partnered with the Atlantic Council in an effort to weed out inauthentic content ùon the platform This organization isfunded byvarious NATO governments and a slew of arms manufacturers like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Its board includes names like Henry Kissinger and former CIA director Michael Hayden î and it has consistently lobbied for regime change in Syria and, you guessed it, Venezuela, where it has funnelled large amounts of money intopro opposition groupsfor years So, it s no surprise that weeks after Facebook partnered up with this less than objective group, it deleted from its platform the page belonging to top English language, left leaning Latin American news outlet Telesur without any explanation at all The page was restored two days later, with Facebookcitingvague instability on the platform ùas the cause of the block Telesur just so happens to be one of the only major outlets reporting on events in Venezuela in a manner that goes against the US government position and US mainstream media perspective î so obviously, out with Alex Jones it must go It wasn t just Telesur, though Facebook deleted the pages belonging to independent grassrootsVenezuela AnalysisandHaiti Analysis, which are also leftist websites highly critical of US foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean region Facebook s shuttering of@telesurenglish s page comes days after it did the same to@venanalysispage w/o explanation The latest outgrowth of FB s Orwellian partnership w/ the Atlantic Council ICMYI,@MaxBlumenthaldiscussed it w/ me on@TheRealNews:https:// tdotco /3XayXXpg34https:// tdotco /ZgTaJv0rdU 2 Facebook complying with Israeli deletion orders Last year, journalist Glenn Greenwaldreportedthat Facebook met with Israeli government officials to determine which Palestinian activists should have their accounts deleted The Israeli government threatened to enact laws forcing Facebook to comply with its deletion orders if it did not do so voluntarily Of course, Facebook capitulated immediately and set about deleting accounts owned by Palestinian activists Of some 158 requests submitted (over just four months) by Tel Aviv to Facebook asking for the removal of Palestinian content, 95 percent of them were granted According to the same Intercept report, †Facebook hasn t been overly concerned about what Israelis themselves are saying on Facebook and even calls for murder can be ignored by the social media giant 3 Google and Facebook censorship of left/socialist websites The World Socialist Web Site reported last year that changes to Google s algorithms had seriously negatively impacted left wing socialist and anti war websites An analysis by WSWS found that 13 such websites had seen their traffic plunge by a whopping 55 percent in the six months since Google had changed its algorithms WSWS itself experienced a 74 percent drop in traffic between April and July last year The changes also affected sites like Alternet, which saw its traffic plunge by 71 percent between April and September, Democracy Now (50 percent drop) and Truth out org (49 percent drop) Similarly, Police the Police (a page dedicated to exposing US police brutality) and the Free Thought Project (which focuses on government transparency) also saw their Facebook pagetraffic tankin 2018 after Facebook made changes to its newsfeed and search algorithms in an effort to combat fake news ù PTP traffic dropped from between 12 15 million people per week to about 4 million î and the website had to fire its writing staff as a result The left is cheering this on, when historically the left is usually the side cheering for free speech, ùPTP founder Jason Bassler told Mic Amidst all of the celebration over the banning of Jones, some on the left cautioned that in fact, the left may indeed be the real target ùin all of this î and that those celebrating while people like Jones are banned are in fact being conditioned ùinto accepting further censorship down the road As we have been trying to tell you the real target for neoliberal corporate censorship was always the left Now that they have conditioned public to accept it as a result of Russiagate, the left is in their crosshairs https:// tdotco /zt2oMIbtDC 4 Legitimate left wing protests targeted? A particularly strange example of Facebook s commitment to banning fake news ùand promoting a nice, cozy atmosphere for everyone online is its decision to delete event pages for anti racist and anti fascist protests happening in Washington D C The No Unite the Right 2 DC ùevent (a counter rally against a previous white nationalist event in the city) was taken down after Facebook decided it displayed some coordinated inauthentic behavior ù(the kind of random phrase that can no doubt be arbitrarily applied to anything without explanation) The event organizer said in a statement: This is a real protest in Washington, D C It is not George Soros It is not Russia It is just us ù 5 Twitter suspending and banning anti war activists Twitter has come under fire recently for shadowbanning ùconservative accounts, making them harder to find on the platform and having their tweets appear less prominently in people s feeds in an effort to limit their audience But again, it s not just the right Twitter recently suspended the accounts of Daniel McAdams, the executive director of the libertarian and antiwar Ron Paul Institute and Scott Horton, the editor of the AntiWar com website Explaining what happened, McAdamssaidthat he and Horton were suspended after defending former US diplomat Peter Van Buren who had just beenbannedpermanently from Twitter after heated exchanges with journalist Jonathan M Katz over what Van Buren said was his unwillingness to challenge government lies ù In one of his tweets to Katz, Buren sarcastically commented: I hope a MAGA guy eats your face Katz reported him for promoting violence and Twitter later caved and removed Buren s account A note from Peter Van Buren@wemeantwelland a screenshot of the boo hoo little bitch who tattled on him pic twitter com/qKukwabnyd In explaining his suspension, Twitter told McAdams that he could not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease ù î none of which he accepts that he did Perhaps the really amazing thing about all of this is that it is happening in front of our eyes and the powers that be are not even bothering to lie about it Elected US officials are openly promoting this kind of censorship as a way to prevent the sowing of discord among populations At a Senate Judiciary Committee last year about Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online, ùDemocratic Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono called on social media platforms to prove their commitment to preventing the fomenting of discord ùonline Working hand in glove with governments, corporations like Facebook have been handed enormous power to decide what constitutes free speech and which opinions are worthy of being heard How long will it be before people realize banning Alex Jones wasn t really a victory at all?

"25 Jun, 2018","Atlantic Council finally admits Ukraine‚Äôs Nazi problem, and seems upset RT reported it earlier","RT has accurately and consistently chronicled the rise of neo Nazism in Ukraine Now, rather belatedly, NATO s principal mouthpiece has finally joined in, throwing some bizarre shade at this network in the process Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv KRASNODAR For the uninitiated, the Atlantic Council is NATO s propaganda wing And whenever its lobbyists, or guest writers, publish opinions which digress from the standard Washington foreign policy establishment position, it usually suggests a change in attitude is on the cards Last week, the think tank ù sent Ukraine a clear message: get your extremists & neo Nazis under control promptly and start taking the threat they pose seriously In doing so, the Atlantic Council also finallyacknowledgedthe problem exists Something readers and viewers of RT have been aware of since the first Euromaidan protests back in 2013 However, for years, this reportage was dismissed by pro NATO activists as Kremlin propaganda ù So what has changed? Well, Ukraine s far right has become so emboldened that even the countries biggest defenders are beginning to realize the threat they pose to the narrative established since the 2014 change of power in Kiev For instance, just this weekend near the western city of Lvov, a member of the Roma community was murdered during a pogrom Additionally, others were stabbed, including an eight year old child Amid total impunity, Roma pogroms in Ukraine have now become deadly Another Roma settlement in Lviv, biggest city of Western Ukraine, attacked overnight: one person is killed, many stabbed Police detains 7 people, considers to open the investigation Farther eastwards, in the capital Kiev, for some months now, aneo Nazi militiahas been imposing its own order †with street patrols Meanwhile, the legal authorities either offer tacit approval or are helpless to stop Azov or perhaps a mixture of both While all this sounds like something from a history book, documenting the time of Hitler, Franco, and Mussolini, it s the reality in Europe s second largest country today And it s clear that the mainstream media simply won t be able to ignore the situation for much longer Indeed, even American state broadcaster RFE/RL hasconcededthat Azov s induction ceremonies are more reminiscent of 1930s Germany than of postwar democracy, ùas they include nationalist chants, raised fists, and a torchlight march through central Kyiv* (sic) ù But has the horse bolted? Many experts think so Ivan Katchanovski, a Ukrainian emigre professor in Canada, has consistently warned of the dangers of appeasing ultra nationalists This weekend, hetweeted: far right violence became normalized and mainstream in Ukraine following their crucial role in violent attacks during Maidan, (the) Maidan and Odesa (sic) massacres, war in Donbas & political assassinations But Western governments and media chose to deny and ignore this Now it is too late ù His view is supported by Tarik Cyril Amar of Columbia University Timing mattered enormously: in 2014 Ukraine needed the West urgently The West was engaged, rightly, but not as, literally, invested as now That was the moment, obviously, not to let the far right infiltration tactics pass, ù he wrote That was also the moment when western intellectuals signed a letter to do precisely that because: wartime emergency, Russian info war, blablabla And that was the tip of the iceberg To all those who joined what Andreas Umland later proudly called the fencing season for the right: congrats You now know how it feels to be a fellow traveler (sic) ù That was also the moment when western intellectuals signed a letter to do precisely that because: wartime emergency, Russian info war, blablabla And that was the tip of the iceberg Thus, Atlantic Council s volte face is timely But one wonders why the editor chose the title: Ukraine s Got a Real Problem with Far Right Violence (And No, RT Didn t Write This Headline) ù Because it bears no relation to the writer Josh Cohen s text, in which he doesn t mention this network at all My guess is the pressure group feels it has tripped over itself here Because for some years now, it has been attempting to present everything RT reports as inadmissible, owing to its fears that Russian media threatens the dominance of the Western establishment press, which is overwhelmingly pro NATO And like all true believers, Atlantic Council lobbyists don t tolerate dissent Yet, the simple fact remains: RT reported on Ukraine s Nazi problem when mainstream outlets deliberately ignored this reality Back in October of 2014, Iwrote: If it walks like a Nazi and quacks like a Nazi it s the far right, ù adding when correspondents in Kiev see Nazis, they report only the presence of far right nationalists, a far more palatable term Welcome to the bizarre world of Western media in Ukraine A self contained pit of rumor, fear, braggadocio and propaganda ù Earlier that month, Ipublished A journalist s duty is to inform: have western press forgotten this in Ukraine? ù Again, questioning why journalists refused to report the facts After this, for challenging their groupthink, many of the Western hack pack unfollowed or blocked me on Twitter: the modern form of journalistic ostracism In May of last year, as the far right became even more visible, Iaskedwhy western reporters in Kiev continue to ignore the rise of Neo Nazism in Ukraine And five months later, I noted the lack of press coverage after up to 20,000 far right radicals honored the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) a paramilitary group led by Stepan Bandera, which actively collaborated with Hitler s Germany They brandished lit torches, smoke pellets, and flares as they chanted fascist slogans And some participants openly gave Nazi salutes during the rally ù So, readers of my columns, and of RT s work in general, have been well aware of Ukraine s Nazi problem while consumers of Western media are generally blissfully ignorant, as it has largely turned a blind eye Yet, the Atlantic Council routinely calls for restrictions on RT Indeed, only last autumn, itwantedthis network to be †listed as a foreign agent in the United States: a move which was clearly coordinated with policymakers because, within weeks, the wish was granted Furthermore, a month later itdismissedRT as a Low Grade Platform for Useful Idiots ù READ MORE: Useful idiots?

"5 Jun, 2018","Soros perpetuates myth of Russian bogeyman, blames Putin for Italian anti-immigrant party","Apparently convinced that the Italian people support the flow of illegal aliens into their country, billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros imagines a Russian hand behind the rise of Italy s Euroskeptic party Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge For globalists like George Soros, who hasspenta sizeable chunk of his personal fortune lobbying EU leaders for the unimpeded flow ofmigrantsinto their respective states, the last few days have been an unmitigated nightmare Two Italian anti establishment parties, the hard right League and the Five Star movement,forged a coalitiongovernment that puts †a gang of Euroskeptics into power in the EU s fourth largest economy It is thefirst populist governmentin Western Europe Today, when Europeans speak of their Euroskepticism, the criticism is invariably linked to the eurozone s double edged sword: on the one side of the blade is the single currency, which has not lifted all boats in Italy, not by a long shot On the other side is a massive influx of illegal immigrants pouring into the continent, the majority of which are fleeing from NATO backed wars in the Middle East Italy, smack on the front line of the migrant invasion ùfrom North Africa, has been forced to accept some 750,000 migrants Combined with a sputtering economy, many Italians are now enraged with their legacy parties ùand even more so with blissfully detached Brussels To shed some light on the national mood, Italy s new Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvinitolda group of cheering locals that the island of Sicily will no longer serve as Europe s refugee camp So, who does George Soros blame for this undercurrent of anger and resentment now ripping through the world of Italian politics?

Then it means that we are going in the right direction The wind has changed for [Soros] and for all those who have profited from the deaths of hundreds of people Soros, at a sprightly 87 years old, did not waste the opportunity while in Italy to express his indignation towards Donald Trump, the US leader who was also smuggled into power, according to the Democrats and various Russophobes, by the Kremlin Once again, the underlying message here is that the Americans, like the Italians, are simply incapable of formulating any sort of an intelligent opinion for themselves After 12 years of war and stagnant economic growth under former presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, the US electorate should have been simply ecstatic over the possibility of Hillary Clinton, yet another pro war establishment figure, getting into the White House And if things somehow turned out otherwise indeed, as they most certainly did well, it must have been due to the Russians According to this delightful bit of absurdity, Russian trolls managed to swing themulti billion dollarUS presidential election in their favor due to a few hundred tweets and Facebook advertisements And yes, there are people who actually buy that story By refusing to admit that failure is an integral part of the democratic process, individuals like George Soros and Hillary Clinton will simply lie, cheat and hoodwink the system media, judicial and political until they get their way And that is precisely what is now happening in the United States Despite Russiagate disintegrating into an embarrassing he said, she said National Enquirer expose, complete with an adult film star, Trump continues to be embroiled in an investigation that has entered its second year The crazy can be expected to continue at least until congressional midterms in November If the Democrats are able to clinch victory, the world will most likely be treated to many months, maybe years, of impeachment proceedings against the most controversial political figure to grace the halls of Washington in a long time Say what you will about Trump, but the fact that the establishment will go to such incredible lengths to discredit him means they genuinely fear him Why is a completely different question There is an upside to all of this madness, at least as far as Russia is concerned By continually and predictably resorting to the Russia card whenever things don t go their way, which has been rather frequently of late, people like Soros and Clinton, the so called globalists, only serve to cheapen and invalidate their transparent agenda Ironically, Soros borrowed exactly the same argument against Russia that the Clinton campaign used: The Kremlin is trying to weaken the EU What impeccable logic! The fact is that, if Putin or anyone else was really interested in weakening the EU or the US (if such a thing were even possible), they would not trouble themselves by putting populist politicians in power, who would work to reverse the rot of unregulated immigration, and other such irritants In fact, they would just let Soros and his merry band of mischief makers continue doing exactly what they have been doing all along: destroy the EU from within with a disastrous agenda In closing, it bears mentioning that President Putin justsigned a lawmandating the implementation of counter sanctions against any state or person involved in hostile actions ùagainst Russia Whether that legislation works to tame the anti Russia hysteria now inflaming the planet with fake news remains to be seen @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428811-soros-italy-putin-eu/
"1 Jun, 2018",Brussels sees threat to democracy everywhere liberals don‚Äôt win ‚Äì Hungarian foreign minister,"The EU doesn t know how to deal with its member Hungary, where the strong prime minister, Orban, dares to defy Brussels vision for the future How will Hungary hold up under pressure and how will this dispute shape the EU? We talked to the foreign minister of the country, P√©ter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, it s really good to have you on our programme again Welcome back P√©ter Szijjart√≥:It s my honour Thanks for letting me be here SS:Lots to talk about There are tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over the rights of the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Ukraine And you have said that Ukraine stabbed Hungary in the back ù What is Hungary s reaction going to be? PS:Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the europeanunion to help the Ukrainians to get the visa free regime and to make the EU Ukraine Association agreement to come into force And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine SS:So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn t abide by Ukrainian laws Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? PS:Well, you know, we are part of the alliance So it s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro Atlantic integration path And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission SS:So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? PS:There s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the europeanunion about how we see this situation We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations We will see whether there s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that SS:Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs You ve said those are lies Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? PS:We had and we re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti migration policy We made it very clear that it s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary It s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together We don t want to let neither the europeanunion nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don t want to invite We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context SS:Are they groundless? PS:Yeah, absolutely I mean, just let me give you two examples All these accusations say that there s no media freedom in Hungary But if you look in the Internet, for example, if you look at the web pages you will see that anti government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country In some Western European countries it did happen Or when it comes to anti Semitism it s a constant accusation against us Although we re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti Semitism There s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well It s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets SS: in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely PS: and compared to that we re always under accusations SS:Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights Could it come to that? PS:There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland We opposed that because we absolutely think it s based on double standards When you take facts into consideration there s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court So these are all closed issues So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary SS:So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn t meet those demands whether it s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: We may not fund you in the next EU budget ù Here s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to † 6 percent of your budget First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr Orban said: We don t need German money anyways ù PS:Well, you know, Hungary s interest is the europeanunion to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong europeanunion We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the europeanunion We have an export to GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the europeanunion to be strong and to have a competitive economy On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy But this is not a one way road We don t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends These funds are to be given to us based on contracts Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit This is one lane of the road And the other lane of the road is the European funding So, this is not a one way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation We totally reject that false context, we re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free This is not true We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies SS:There s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland the East vs West because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point I don t think Brussels likes it † What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? PS:We re absolutely interested in the unity of the europeanunion We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the europeanunion because the europeanunion must show unity Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let s put it this way, well, it s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the europeanunion We are the two countries where a one party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country We have absolutely stable political systems Many times it s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels There s a big debate in the europeanunion whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because SS: yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration That s what France and Germany want Do you think it s a viable thing? PS:Our position is that europeanunion can only be strong if there are strong member states So we don t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong europeanunion would be realistic We think that only strong member states can form a strong europeanunion That s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the europeanunion , meaning that we don t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes But the answer shouldn t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes SS:Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the europeanunion as an alliance of sovereign states europeanunion is the union that crosses state boundaries It s, like, the core principle of the europeanunion  europeanunion is based on the principles of liberalism Your country is a nation based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing Russia s same way On ideological level there are so many differences In a basis it s not even economics Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? PS:Well, actually, it s not everything SS:But core things PS:Yeah, but if you look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we re somewhere in the middle, so, there s nothing extraordinary in this regard We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course That s why what we re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit based society There are debates about that as well But all in all our interest is the strong europeanunion because within the strong europeanunion Hungary can be strong SS:There s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are sandbags ù that can be thrown away Could it come to that? PS:Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the Visegrad countries are members of the europeanunion and will be members of the europeanunion Even more than that This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the europeanunion Our growth rate is much higher than the European average Everybody speaks about the German French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness But if you look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the europeanunion because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the europeanunion being strong as well That s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us SS:The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions There s the center Brussels, France and Germany who want more integration and maybe a two speed Europe It s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now Something needs to change We don t really know what Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won t be as integrated as France and Germany? PS:If you mean that the europeanunion is faced with historic challenges, you re right Not only one We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with So that s why I think it s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the europeanunion because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states For instance, take the migration issue Hungary s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country SS:I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway What s the point of being so tough on it if you were going to secretly accept those people anyway? PS:These are two totally different things Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth These two things shouldn t be confused because these are two different issues SS:The mood in the europeanunion in general is changing Austria has the first anti immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it s pretty much center right as well Do you feel like saying we ve told you so, we ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying ù? PS:You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the europeanunion the main issue was migration That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti migration policies You ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who s definitely representing an anti migration policy In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti migration parties In Hungary we ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior And you ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn t serve the target of a better future of the europeanunion SS:So how come so many countries in the EU are anti immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that Just as many countries are against anti Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending † them all of them agree silently to extend them Why can t you be as firm on anti Russia sanctions? PS:Well, if you ask me whether there are double standards I would say yes ù We are a small country And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here If you come to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries If you see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents If you look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved If you look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised If you ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are There s a big debate in the europeanunion whether the sanctions were successful or not But definitely the unity of the europeanunion is very important SS: Even if it is at the expense of the anti Russian sanctions? PS: that s why the prolongation of the sanctions has already been decided upon But it s interesting to come here to see the big Western European companies making business with the Russian counterparts SS:You know, we re open to anyone who wants to come and make business with us Thank you very much for this interview, Foreign Minister Good luck with everything PS:Thank you I really do appreciate it RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/428412-hungary-eu-pressure-deal/
"9 Apr, 2018",Orban's win speaks to growing tide of anti-EU feeling,"Viktor Orban s landslide win in Hungary s parliamentary elections on Sunday has handed him a fresh mandate and four more years to torment Brussels with his anti immigration policies and Euroskeptic rhetoric is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Orban s victory is a huge win for anti EU parties across Europe and a humiliation and headache for Brussels The Hungarian leader has been a thorn in Brussels side in recent years, with his staunchly anti migration stance perhaps the biggest bone of contention In his final speech before Hungarians went to the polls, Orban once again took aim at Europe s controversial migration policies Immigration is the blight that slowly but surely devours our homeland, he said Mass migration threatens the everyday security to which we are accustomed With mass migration comes a greater threat of terror With near record voter turnout, Orban s Fidesz has won 133 parliamentary seats of 199, giving him the supermajority needed to make constitutional changes While the United Kingdom has caused a headache for Brussels by voting to leave the EU, Hungary has caused somewhat of a headache by staying and upsetting the Western liberal apple cart One liberal Hungarian friend who contacted me as the results came in was sorely disappointed No one was expecting Orban to lose, but nor were they expecting his win to be so resounding In fact, in the months leading up the elections, there was an air of cautious optimism from the opposition parties There had been some heated debate over how leftists should approach the spring election Some strongly advocated joining with the far right Jobbik party in an effort to prevent Orban from further consolidating his power Other liberals were vehemently opposed to such an alliance, a deal with the devil, so to speak but at the end of the day, it didn t matter The Hungarian left is made up of a number of small parties the Green LMP ( Politics Can Be Different ), the socialist MSZP, the Democratic Coalition (DK) and some tiny parties like Egyutt ( Together ) and Momentum A typical complaint among Hungarian liberals is that these parties suffer from a serious case of disorganization and an inability to work together to achieve common aims The satirical Two Tailed Dog party, which ran on promises of free beer and eternal life, won three times as many votes as Egyutt a result which should surely convince them of the importance unity on the left if they ever want to put a dent in Fidesz s power Hungarian elections are generally regarded as being carried out fairly and legitimately There is no suggestion that this vote was tampered with or fixed in any way Following the 2014 parliamentary elections, OSCE monitorsconcludedthat Hungarians were offered a genuine choice and that elections were carried out transparently and efficiently That, however, does not mean the election system is entirely fair, either The OSCE also said that Fidesz enjoyed undue advantage due to a number of factors, including biased media coverage (due to state interference with independent media) and gerrymandered districts This is a fair assessment and as I havewritten before, is comparable to many other countries, including the United States, where third party candidates receive scant media coverage and where gerrymandering and political corruption are also serious issues There has been some rather odd media and political reaction to Orban s victory Stefan Simanowitz, Amnesty International s media manager for Europe,tweetedout a Guardian report on the election, saying that people in Hungary are bracing themselves for a torrid four years after Orban s win In reality, the majority of Hungarians are clearly satisfied with the outcome, having made the decision to vote for Fidesz so the idea that people in general in Hungary are unhappy with the result does not stand up to reason In fairness, if people in Hungary are bracing themselves for a torrid four years, why did Fidesz win so easily? The US/UK media doesn t seem to be interested in Orban s supporters, who are also people This is similar to how they cover Russia https:// tdotco /55X13VbE3e Former US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder added his voice to the Western chorus of anger over Orban s win, tweeting that European leaders who care about liberalism should impose real costs on Hungary This puts a rather interesting spin on liberalism and democracy Is Daalder suggesting Hungarians who cast their votes for the candidates of their choice be punished in some way for doing so? Are election results in the EU only legitimate when the outcome suits Brussels? Hungary deals another blow to liberalism, with Fidesz and Jobbik winning 70% of vote Long past time that leaders who still care about liberalism (Merkel, Macron, Tusk) let their voices be heard, take action and impose real costs Despite what Western media †might have us believe, Orban is far from on his own in Europe His victory speaks to a growing tide of anti EU feeling across the 28 member bloc Horst Seehofer, Germany s federal interior minister whose Bavarian CSU party is an important ally to Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats said he was pleased with Orban s clear victory and warned that the arrogance and paternalism with respect to other member states coming from Brussels is wrong Merkel and Seehofer are currently at odds over Germany s immigration policies Italy s Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti migration Northern League, and whose center right alliance is now the biggest political bloc in the country, congratulated Hungarians on defending their own companies, their own workers, their own students, their own future and their own borders France s National Front leader Marine Le Pen said Orban s win reflected the rejection of the mass immigration policies favored by Brussels and tweeted optimism that nationalists could win a majority in the 2019 European Parliament elections Hungary has its fair share of problems and Orban has undoubtedly moved toward a more authoritarian style of leadership Nonetheless, his win is legitimate and will empower him further There is already talk of a crackdown on non governmental organizations as part of Orban s long running feud with liberal Hungarian billionaire George Soros The stopsoros package of laws would target non governmental organizations which support migration Among the proposals is a 25 percent tax on foreign donations received by those NGOs Orban can now go to Brussels with an even clearer mandate than he had before, which will be much to his benefit His victory and unwavering commitment to his party s policies in the face of extreme criticism will also inspire other anti EU, anti immigration parties across the EU to follow in Orban s footsteps where they can ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/423629-hungary-orban-election-anti-eu/
"19 Feb, 2018",Indictment of Russians over US election meddling is case of pot calling the kettle black,"If the US federal grand jury indicts 13 Russians for meddling in the US vote with no allegations ù that it influenced the outcome, then the investigation by Mueller should disband and take its place on the garbage heap of history F Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst †At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily critical technologies Those cases served as an early warning to decision makers of potential policy issues He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia F Michael Maloof, former Pentagon security analyst †At the Pentagon, his work included halting the diversion of militarily critical technologies Those cases served as an early warning to decision makers of potential policy issues He also provided training to border guards in the Caucasus and Central Asia On the face of it, to suggest that 13 Russian individuals attempted to alter the course of the US democratic election process is absolutely laughable, considering that the US mainstream media had teamed up with the Hillary Clinton campaign to barrage Americans daily with relentless stories of alleged Russian collusion with the campaign of Donald Trump to alter the 2016 election outcome To date, no such collusion has been uncovered If only 13 people allegedly attempted to alter the election outcome, you have to ask yourself: Is that all there is? So, 13 Russians allegedly planted ideas on popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where crazy ideas already abound There never was any evidence in the indictment that even suggested any Russian attempt to manipulate through hacking voting stations The alleged disinformation campaign amounted to calls for demonstrations or the printing of ads, which in many instances were hilarious Certainly, discerning and naturally skeptical Americans know the difference and have never thought that alternative ideas were a threat to the US democratic system, whether it s by Russians or even American billionaires who use their fortunes to try and alter the US political process Indeed, ongoing congressional investigations reveal something even more sinister in the US democratic process Namely, that the Clinton campaign paid for a so called Russian dossier to undermine the Trump campaign and it was done in actual collusion with high level officials of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation This is unprecedented in US politics and is tantamount to the action of a police state And it was perpetrated by Democrats who concocted the Russian collusion scheme to discredit the legitimacy of the Trump election If the US was inferring in the indictment that 13 Russian individuals sought to undermine the entire American democratic process, it is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black, since there are stark examples of past US efforts to interfere in elections and, indeed, overthrow democratically elected governments of other countries Many of those past instances continue to have a major adverse impact on US influence in foreign policy In 1953, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh The impact culminated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and has affected what there is of US Iranian relations to this day During the administration of President Richard Nixon, he and his then national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, were involved in the1973coup of democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende Once again, the CIA was involved in the Chilean military s ousting of Allende, which then committed atrocities on its own citizens In his 90s today, Kissinger continues to give President Trump foreign policy advice Fast forward to modern day efforts to affect the outcome of elections in other countries, former president Barack Obama s repeated efforts to interfere in the elections of other nations are more numerous than most past US presidents Ironically, the mainstream media played down those efforts Among those examples, during the 2015 election in Israel, the Obama administration illegally attempted to prevent the re election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to major personal and policy differences The administration covertly funneled State Departmentgrantsto opposition groups to the tune of some $350,000, including a group called the One Voice Movement One of Obama s field directors from his last presidential campaign actually oversaw the operation in an effort to topple the Netanyahu government As usual, no one was held accountable In 2014, the Obama administration was instrumental in supporting and helping to finance the violent overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych To further underscore Obama s involvement in the internal affairs of another country, the American Spectatorreportedthat the government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, had obtained government documents showing that the US government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center right government in Macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist George Soros ùJudicial Watch further stated that then Obama ambassador to Macedonia, Jeff Baily, sought to funnel millions of dollars from the State Department and USAID to groups created by Soros to overthrow the Macedonian government In 2011, Obama was instrumental in the ousting of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to push the election of Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Morsi A secular leader, Mubarak was ousted, similar to Obama s efforts along with his then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in the violent military overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011 Based on what is now known, Clinton s hatchet man, Sidney Blumenthal, had helped provide information particularly on potential oil contracts in the country, which prompted her to convince an at first reluctant Obama to take military action with a coalition of the willing ùfrom among NATO countries for regime change in Libya Last, but not least, is the example of former President George W Bush s 2003 invasion of Iraq, which led to the violent overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein As in the case of the 1953 coup in Iran, the US experience in Iraq has had a lasting impact on American influence not only in that country but throughout the entire Middle East Ironically, US law prohibits the use of tax dollars to influence foreign elections Clearly, if America doesn t want interference in its own democratic process, it shouldn t be doing it to other countries by overthrowing their governments and inflicting pain and suffering on the lives of millions of people ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/419221-us-meddling-iraq-libya/
"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// tdotco /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director Michael Morrell Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who recently announced he was partially abandoning his Russian scholarship and has lost interest in maintaining my (sic) ability to speak/write Russian ù is another team member Im also done doing research about Russia for now Russian politics is not so interesting these days I have lots of other academic interests (Ill remain engaged on the foreign policy side )https:// tdotco /grSlZXZ9GO And sorry that I am not responding in Russian After being on the travel ban list to your country for 3 years, I have lost interest in maintaining my ability to speak/write Russian You government seems to really fear me these days —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ –∏ –∂–∞–ª—å–∫–æhttps:// tdotco /8SRdSEvg5r After serving on Obama s team, McFaul has re invented himself as a network TV personality since 2016 with 280,000 Twitter followers, 106,000 of which are fake, according toTwitter audit Who pays for it?USAID are big backers, throwing in a seven figure annual sum This, of course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don t agree with their government s policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad s government as well as Iranian and Russian influence pic twitter com/nmSTkSzb5G Who are its people?Kimberly Kagan is the brains behind this operation She s married to Frederick Kagan, who was involved in the neocon Project for the New American Century group along with his brother, Robert Kagan Which makes Kimberly the sister in law of Victoria f**k the EU ùNuland Another lobbyist is Ukrainian Natalia Bugayova, who was involved in Kiev s 2014 EuroMaidan coup She previously worked for the Kiev Post, a resolutely anti Russian newspaper which promotes US interests in Ukraine However, IFTSOW s most notorious lobbyist was Elizabeth O Bagy, who emerged as a Syria expert in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain O Bagy has alsocollaboratedwith the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which is further evidence of how tight knit the world of US neoconservative advocacy really is Who pays for it?Predictably, Raytheonhas openedits wallet Meanwhile, other US military contractors like General Dynamics and DynCorp are also involved L3, which provides services to the US Department of

"19 Dec, 2017",Newsweek‚Äôs claim Putin is planning World War 3 is completely fake,"Newsweek has again proven that if the Kremlin really wants to discredit Western media, all it needs to do is translate articles about Russia from the mainstream press and distribute them free of charge across the country Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Halloween may have been almost two months ago, butNewsweekhas held back the horror until Christmas: PUTIN is PREPARING for WORLD WAR III YEAH, THAT S BAD NEWS, ù it bellows in its latest cover story, with capital letters sprinkled around to make things extra scary The whole setup screams get them to the nuclear shelter now ù because big bad Vlad (sic) is going to unleash hell Except, he s not And Newsweek knows he s not We know this because the shower of amateurs who run the piss poor magazine have exaggerated a lengthy diatribe based on a conversation with a single named source And who is this prophet of doom? Is it a high ranking whistleblower from inside the Kremlin or perhaps even General Gerasimov himself, armed with his doctrine? ùNo, instead it s a columnist for a Russian opposition newspaper, who used to work for a lobby group in the United States, which has beenaccusedof spreading anti Russian propaganda by the foreign ministry in Moscow It s all so depressingly predictable But it d be funny if it wasn t so serious Can we imagine the pitch, for a moment? It must have gone something like this: Owen Matthews (the author): Good morning, editor, I have a huge scoop You see, Putin is preparing for World War Three Editor: Wow, Owen, that s amazing What are your sources? ù Matthews: Well, I have two unnamed British guys who are not authorized to speak, so you will have to take my word on it, and a Russian bloke who writes for the Novaya Gazeta paper, which publishes three times a week ù Editor: That sounds legit, Owen It s so well researched that I am going to make it the cover story ù And this is a prime example of how pathetic Western media coverage of Russia is right now We get half cocked stories, quite obviously made to suit the agenda of newsdesks in London, New York, and Washington Usually based on obscure or anonymous sources In the past month, we ve already had two classic examples of shambolic and embarrassing reportage The UK Independentwasfirst out of the blocks, promoting a threadbare scoop, based on a Moscow rumor, about how Vladimir Putin was tired and considered leaving the presidency: ù it was published a few weeks before he announced his intention to run for another six year term And then Foreign Policy s Moscow correspondentmoanedthat it was impossible to cultivate sources in Russia before the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out that she d never even tried to contact their press secretary since receiving accreditation #Zakharova: Since receiving accreditation,@Amie_FRhas never used any of the aforementioned means to contact the Russian Foreign Ministrypic twitter com/fV1uWPYl7I While those two incidents can be put down to incompetence, and reporters being out of their depth, Newsweek has jumped the shark completely They offer no evidence that Russia is planning for World War Three, save for a few lines from Pavel Felgenhauer, who used to write for the Moscow Times and has beenassociatedwith America s Jamestown Foundation Felgenhauer is no Nostradamus either You see, back in 2008, hetoldGerman state broadcaster Deutsche Welle that Moscow would be dragged into a prolonged and difficult war ù after Mikhail Saakashvili invaded South Ossetia because it s a logistical nightmare to try to take South Ossetia back from Georgia s quite good military ù But, ultimately, it took Moscow s forces just two days to remove all Georgian soldiers from the restive province As it happens, Newsweek, since its 2014 reincarnation, hasconsistentlypublished nonsense stories about Russia A prime example coming in the summer of 2015, when theyallegedMoscow was helping east Ukrainian rebels to build a dirty bomb ù A widelydebunkedpiece of piffle the magazine has never retracted And, incidentally, the author now handles communications at George Soros opensociety , which tells its own tale So, what s behind Newsweek s incessant anti Russia stance, and its reliance on poorly researched articles to drive home its agenda? Perhaps it s related to an unusual partnership with NATO s Atlantic Council adjunct Because, for the past couple of years,Newsweekhas beenpublishingadvertorials from the notoriouslyRussophobiclobby group As it happens, the Atlantic Council s activities arefundedby military contractors Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Raytheon Company; the Ukrainian World Congress and United States Department of State In other words, the very same sort of entities which benefit, in terms of relevance or profits, from presenting Russia as a threat Just fancy that!

"22 Nov, 2017",‚ÄòMladic verdict was determined even before court was formed‚Äô,"A UN tribunal has handed General Ratko Mladic a life sentence over his role in the Balkan Wars of the 1990s Some analysts told RT they believe the trial inherently had nothing to do with real justice, and was merely used to push the interests of NATO The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) found the former Bosnian Serb general guilty on 10 out of 11 counts of crimes he was accused of On Wednesday, the court sentenced Mladic, 75, to life in prison for his alleged role in atrocities dating back to the 1992 1995 war, including the massacre of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica Mladic pleaded not guilty on all charges He also accused the tribunal of being a NATO court, ùadding that all charges against him were lies ùFollowing the verdict, analysts told RT that the tribunal had, in fact, never been a fair trial They say it was more of a show used to spread a view of the 1992 1995 conflict that would suit the interests of NATO and the US The general was declared a war criminal by the NATO powers even before the court was formed, so it is clear that he was determined ùto be found guilty in any case, journalist and political analyst John Bosnitch told RT RT:Is this a verdict that you anticipated? John Bosnitch:This verdict was anticipated even before the court was formed During the civil war in Bosnia, the European powers, which were backing the Muslim and the Croat side, were calling General Ratko Mladic a war criminal even before the court was formed to try him He was never given a presumption of innocence even from the first day RT:Then are you surprised that the trial lasted as long as it did? JB:If you are going to try people in full, it sometimes takes quite a lot of time to do it You draw the trial out, you let both sides appear to have a fair trial; you let them present the evidence; you disregard the evidence that shows that the accused party is innocent; you refer only to the evidence that is proven in many documents to be untrue and then you convict him What we have here is not a delivery of justice through a lengthy and detailed trial but a very complicated and purposely drawn out show trial to keep the name of General Mladic in the news for the best part of a decade and to thus demonize the entire Serbian people RT:Mladic was accused of crimes against humanity This is a very high profile case Are you confident that all of those who committed such crimes during the war in Yugoslavia have been brought before the tribunal? JB:The point is that the tribunal was a one sided tool of the NATO powers The purpose of the tribunal was to find one side guilty, and that was the Serbian side, because they were accused of being war criminals long before the court was formed There is no surprise about the way it was done What is surprising is that anyone, anywhere expected even the slightest chance that General Mladic might be acquitted That, I am sure, no normal rational person could have expected Not because he is guilty but because he was determined to be found guilty even before the first witness presented any evidence So as long as the public knows that there was no other possible verdict even if the man was innocent, then that s fine The NATO powers have had their show trial; we have had the media reports upon it We know that the media, especially the mainstream media, which pushed this case, were described by the US president as the lying mainstream media Another lie was perpetrated through the means of the court and the media The war was promoted by the West The West pushed the Muslims into the war, provided them with weapons, backed them through the war and the lying media delivered the verdict Now we are just doing the autopsy on the death of justice This verdict also creates a potentially dangerous precedent as it could be used by the US to justify future invasions launched without any internationally approved mandate, international affairs commentator Marko Gasic told RT This verdict was necessary primarily for the US, to find someone guilty of genocide is to create yourself a false moral mandate to stop future supposed genocides, ùhe said On the basis of this verdict, the USA will give itself a right to attack anywhere, anytime with its acolytes to [defend] its own interests ù Gasic also said that the Mladic trial was a tribunal financed by the US, Saudi Arabia and George Soros ùAccording to Gasic, it had only one purpose: to achieve the prosecution of a targeted nation the Serbian nation ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/410664-mladic-tribunal-verdict-analysts/

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of colorrevolution s ù around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first colorrevolution , ùa technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed There is just one problem None of it is true The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned ùfrom Communism and despoiled in the process Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros opensociety Fund, USAID and other quasi NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed ù the creation of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election Meanwhile, a student movement called Otpor (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US trained activists, like Srda Popovic Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience Suitcases of cash ù smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5 Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum As a result, ƒêindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist ù expediency Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre or post electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the orangerevolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, colorrevolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences there is always the next revolution to plan and execute And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator ù(there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems Before the dust from the revolution clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters While the colorrevolution s are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago Nebojsa Malic for RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/
"5 Jun, 2017","If George Soros is the answer to the EU crisis, what on earth is the question?","Just as a stopped clock is right twice a day, George Soros, a man who s done more to destabilize countries with a checkbook than entire armies have with tanks and missiles, is right in his assertion that the EU is in crisis Mr Soros addressed the crisis that has engulfed the EU in aspeechto the Brussels Economic Forum on June 1 It was an ambitious speech, one that saw the Hungarian billionaire make a foray into the history of the EU, accurately crediting the vision of European integration to the French businessman and diplomat Jean Monnet He saw the need to bind in particular France and Germany into an economic union and, in time, political union to forestall the prospect of both countries becoming embroiled in any more devastating conflicts, along the lines of the First and Second World Wars Where Mr Soros goes off the rails it is in his depiction of the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe after the Second World War, asserting that: After the Second World War, Western Europe was rebuilt with the help of the Marshall Plan, but it was still threatened by the Soviet Union, which occupied the eastern part of the continent ù Soros funded groups are only network following mafia ways in Hungary Orbanhttps:// tdotco /NPoXZlq4e3pic twitter com/CsQoLf1Sle The truth of the matter is that the Soviet Union liberated Europe from fascism, that without the inordinate tenacity and sacrifice of the Soviet Russian people and the Red Army, Hitler would have succeeded in colonizing the continent As US historian Peter Kuznick writes, Up to [D Day, June 1944], the Soviet Union had almost singlehandedly battled the German military Until the invasion of Normandy, the Red Army was regularly engaging more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten Germany lost over 6 million men on the Eastern Front and approximately one million on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean ù Returning to Mr Soros speech we are regaled with the assertion that the EU is surrounded by hostile powers Putin s Russia, Erdogan s Turkey, Sisi s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can t ù Here again, the billionaire investor is guilty of peddling a convenient inversion of the truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr Soros, also happens to be a member It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: Russia s surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr Soros is right to point out that if the europeanunion carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement That is why the europeanunion needs to be radically reinvented ù The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self evident detriment of millions of working people It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short term investment as and where the opportunity arises It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08 The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti politics or to be more specific anti politics as usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward

might say about Viktor Orban, he s a fast and decisive mover Last Sunday, when thousands demonstrated in Budapest against his proposal to tighten regulation on foreign universities, marchers spoke of a lengthy campaign of resistance Two days later, it was a done deal Orban had rushed the bill through parliament, displaying an efficiency Angela Merkel would admire, if she didn t distrust him for other reasons His target was Soros, Hungary s wealthiest son, who has become a hate figure for nationalists across Europe And a man who divides a country Many Hungarians admire Soros s philosophy and see him as a benefactor However, more again see his influence as nefarious and reject his ethos of globalist Atlanticism For liberals, Hungary has been a huge disappointment Because, back in the early 90 s, it was considered the most westernized of the ex Warsaw pact states And only 20 years ago, the Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats held an overwhelming majority in parliament Yet, with the country facing bankruptcy, they were forced †to implement a hugely unpopular austerity package that allowed Orban s Fidesz party to jump from 20 to 148 seats in the 1998 election For the next decade, the two blocs fought a close battle until the latter took control in 2010, with the Socialists mortally wounded by accusations of rampant corruption, which even led to riots Since then, Orban used his huge 2010 majority to change the constitution and has proven himself something of a chameleon For instance, he has simultaneously cultivated close relations with both Vladimir Putin and Poland s hyper patriotic government And although Russian companies have won significant contracts in the transportation and energy sectors, every time anti Moscow sanctions have come before the europeanunion , Budapest has faithfully backed them Inside the EU, Hungary s attitude to migrants has often created outrage For instance, when Angela Merkel was opening Germany s doors, Orban was constructing a wall to keep the newcomers out However, Fidesz, politically connected to Merkel s CDU movement through Brussels European People s Party grouping, has paradoxically proven to be its most loyal supporter in European parliament votes Fidesz MEPs vote 98 percent with us even more than the Germans, an EPP officialtoldPolitico this week †This displays the genius of Orban s double game Because while he s been busy dismantling liberal democracy in Hungary, EU grant aid has kept rolling in, averaging 2 4 percent of GDP from 2004 2014 And discontent in Brussels has been measured in murmurs, rather than roars Even the Americans seem relatively quiet, meekly observing this week how Washington is disappointed by the accelerated passage of legislation targeting (the) Central European University ùAt the same time, his government s overtures to Donald Trump, which it considers a like minded potential ally, have been met with silence While everybody knows that Orban s obvious desire is to clip Soros wings, the actual legislation itself is slightly more vague It forces foreign universities to close unless there s a bilateral agreement in place between Hungary and their home ùgovernment and they have a campus abroad In the case of the Central European University, the only option is to open a mothership in the US or head for the hills As a result, other locations, in Austria, Romania and Lithuania, have been offering themselves as alternatives The CEU was founded in 1991 in Prague, before former President Vaclav Klaus booted it out a few years later

themselves, while both are Hungarian, they couldn t be more different Soros is a billionaire, whose $25 billion fortune is worth about 20 percent of his homeland s entire GDP He was raised in an upper middle class home in Budapest, his father a lawyer and his mother from a wealthy family of silk traders At the age of 17, he left Hungary and migrated to Britain, where he studied at London s School of Economics Ten years later, New York beckoned and, by his late 30s, Soros had founded his own fund management company By contrast, Orban is a country boy Hailing from the rural county of Fejer, where his father worked in agriculture, he studied law in Budapest However, such was his dislike for city life that, upon graduation, he immediately relocated to a country town, Szolnok, and commuted into the capital for work In 1989, he spent a few months at Oxford University, ironically on a Soros scholarship, but quickly returned to Hungary to enter politics Soros once said he hoped that his foundation would help Hungary become a country from which I wouldn t want to emigrate ùIt seems, at the age of 86, his mission to fashion his homeland s politics to his own agenda has failed That said, the majority of Hungarian voters appear to be supportive of Orban s ambition to create an illiberal, nationalist state, within the europeanunion And there s no doubting how the politician is

"15 Feb, 2017",Munich Security Report: Here comes the apocalypse,"In advance of the 2017 Munich Security Conference (MSC) the organizers have published a report with the subheading Post Truth, Post West, Post Order? The question answers itself, though not for reasons Western liberals will likely accept In the interests of accuracy let us be clear: it is not the West, it is Western liberalism that is in crisis The two entities are distinct and indeed, as events have and continue to prove, completely antithetical to one another The first paragraph of theMSC reportreads as if the end of the world is upon us The world is facing an illiberal moment Across the West and beyond, illiberal forces are gaining ground From within, Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal democratic status quo From outside, Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises with Syria as the prime example ù #Assad: US Russia cooperation could benefit Syria & wider worldhttps:// tdotco /G8xOCEeI9B Implied in this statement is the assumption that liberalism, or liberal values, should be considered sacrosanct, the sine qua non of cultural, political, economic and moral virtue, and as such the values according to which every country, society, and people must exist, regardless of cultural, regional, or historical specificities Therein lies the problem Despite the carnage, chaos, instability, conflict without end, societal collapse, and economic dislocation that has been wrought in the name of those very sacrosanct liberal values and liberal democracy in recent times, its proponents continue to live in a state of abject denial Try telling the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Africa, Latin America, who ve seen their countries and societies destroyed in service to liberal democracy, about this illiberal moment ù they are meant to fear Try telling the ever and shamefully increasing number of victims of poverty, lack of education, poor housing, bad or non existent healthcare provision in Western countries, where liberal values predominate, about them also And when it comes to Syria, cited in the report as evidence of a security crisis ùwhich Western states seem unwilling and unable to effectively tackle, ùhave these people no shame? The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al Qaeda against the US in 2001 In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term Western civilization Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: Donald Trump s comments about NATO being obsolete ù have caused great uncertainty among America s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe The europeanunion is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia ù Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change i e in the former Yugoslavia and Libya It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal democratic values and norms have wrought In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests As George Orwell wrote, War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength ù No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem What they describe as a revisionist Russia ùis really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony Replace revisionist ùwith strong, ùand you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017 They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society Russia s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/377466-munich-security-trump-russia-eu/
"13 Feb, 2017",Merkel breaking German law & endangering the country ‚Äì OSCE Assembly ex-VP,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has been dominating the German and European political landscape for over a decade But after years of economic and refugee crises, unpopular decisions, and a growing divide between EU members, Merkel is facing opposition inside her country and across the Atlantic as well With anti establishment forces strong across Europe and a new leader in America, how will the German political landscape shape up this year? And with the new president in Germany standing against confrontation with Russia should we be ready for a policy shift? We ask the former vice president of the OSCE Assembly, and former state secretary to Germany s defense minister Willy Wimmer Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Willy Wimmer, former vice head of OSCE Assembly, and former State Secretary to Germany s Defence Minister, welcome to the show, it s really great to have you with us Now, The Federal election to determine the new Chancellor is coming up in September and Angela Merkel s top contender Martin Schulz has promised to turn the vote into a real thrill , positioning himself as a man of the people With Merkel already under attack for her immigration policies, is Schulz going to destroy her chances for a fourth term? Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September That s an inner German situation There s another situation coming from our West European neighbors We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social democraticparty no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social democraticparty SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse SS:Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War SS:Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President SS:Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality SS:Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population SS:Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment SS:There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems SS:Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/
"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety , limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ If you were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The opensociety Institute (OSI) and opensociety Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the europeanunion , going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/
"25 Jan, 2017",RT critics admit promotion of Russian media threat is a money racket,"Regular readers of RT Editorial will know this column has provided evidence of how think tanks, which are increasingly indivisible from lobby groups, faithfully promote the specific agendas of their paymasters regardless of their stated high minded missions When it comes to Russia, most of these faux academic concerns have primarily concerned themselves with whipping up hysteria about a supposed imminent military danger to Eastern Europe Shocker: almost all of them arefundedby weapon manufacturers and entities like the US Department of Defense In other words, the very people who need a bogeyman to justify heightened armed forces spending However, convincing the general public that Moscow is going to overrun Europe has always been a hard sell Mainly because Russia is not the USSR and its military spending is much smaller compared to NATO For example, the Kremlin s 2017defense budgetis around $45 billion This compares to the $622 billion Washington hasprojectedfor the coming year That does not include all the other NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, which recentlysigneda $125 billion contract with General Atomics, just for the supply of drones Probably aware they needed a new schtick, in recent years, bodies like The Atlantic Council and the Center For European Policy Analysis have expanded messaging about the supposed Russian threat to the long reigning mainstream media consensus RT is, of course, the favorite target and scary monster As a result, we see a kind of schizophrenic discourse where the network oscillates from being a huge danger to something nobody watches (but still is a cause for a cash call), depending on which agenda they are pushing on a given day With this in mind, it was interesting to note Monday s Guardianpiece, headlined EU escalates its campaign against Russian propaganda, ù for two reasons Firstly, because the newspaper apparently couldn t think of an example of Russian propaganda ùin an article about Russian propaganda ùand instead used a story promoted by an American website, to illustrate the purported Russian threat: In recent weeks the unit (Stratcom East, an EU outfit dedicated to watching Russian news services) has been correcting a widely shared and entirely false story that claimed that a 1,000 strong mob chanting Allahu Akbar ù burned down Germany s oldest church, ùthey wrote This storyappearedon Breitbart, which is based in Los Angeles and is 100 percent American owned Then they followed up, with EU officials estimate that Russia spends $1bn ( 801m) on state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik ùQuite why the EU needs to guess is beyond rational understanding, given how RT is transparent about its financing, which amounts to around $300 million this year, or less than a third of that appraisal Not just that, but all media funding by the Russian state is widely publicized every year, and even adding up the RT and Sputnik budgets still amount to much less than half of the reported figure So much for the MSM s war on fake news ù Just as the EU increased the strength of its Stratcom East ù annex from eleven staff to 19, and lobbed another 800,000 in its direction (because nearly $800 million for BBG and 289 million supplementary Defense & Security funding for BBC World Service clearly weren t enough, not to mention the financial support for the likes of DW, France24, and Euronews to continue fighting the good fight), came a most enlightening conversation between a group of media experts, specializing in the post Soviet space The event washostedby n ost, a German advocacy group, funded by Washington s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which has earned a bit of a reputation forpromoting regime change ùin countries independent of US foreign policy The chat concerned whether articles about Russian propaganda now are more widely read than Russian propaganda itself ùRight now, you can take Russian propaganda ùto mean anything which offers an alternative view to the mainstream media consensus At the roundtable were an interesting bunch of folk Alexey Kovalev, formerly of RIA Novosti, was joined by Vladimir Soloviev of Moldova s Newsmaker, which gets its cash from the European Endowment For Democracy (the EU s version of NED) and Gemma P√∂rzgen, a board member of Reporters Without Borders, a concern funded by George Soros, NED and the EU Commission As they spoke, our heroes seemed to realize how ridiculous the whole hysteria against Russian

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia If there were a hero of the year list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian led airstrikes One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself a decision that also took out the approaching enemy John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko s single act of heroism when he wrote: I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism –£ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥ –ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–æ–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å –Ω–∞ —Å–µ —è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞https:// tdotco /vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that NATO does not seek confrontation, and that it is everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race, the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever closer to Russia s borders However, as Pepe Escobarexplained, The real measure ù is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018 This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s Putin emphasized that NATO s inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to respond adequately to any threat to its national interests On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, Jamala (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision s rules Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors: The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!, Clark concluded via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is, In God We Trust Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as The Satanic Temple (TST) Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics, Thranholm wrote TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000 One of the group s objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan ù Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ù,according to a promotional video Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from God Country : Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US led countries continued with their regime change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from † war torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe s welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants, that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros plan will reap positive benefits via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the forced migration caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it: If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states, Gerrans concluded The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber if not outright disastrous outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance Following news that Germany s Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded: Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign No more In a highly controversial move, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19 year old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony Let s deal with some facts here, Cunningham continued Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years So much then for claims of Russian state sponsored doping ù Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance enhancing drug only in January of this year In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances The US anti doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add insult to injury As Bryan MacDonaldexplained: Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency The reader will be able to discern the line of reasoning in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone: Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes ù In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov s murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs, Whitmore tells us So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime It could also turn out to be a harbinger ù As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump s landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back door machinations Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania The idea didn t seem so wild at the time for a Clinton coup as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306 232), he failed to win the popular vote reportedly by 2 5 million votes Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton in similar fashion to George W Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court could steal the White House from Trump This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes, Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle of so called faithless electors tipping this contest in Clinton s favor Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton an unlikely yet possible scenario Trump went on to formally secure the vote and the presidency on December 19 via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor: Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence ù that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved ù in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta ù against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still ongoing hacking operations from the air Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace Happy New Year!

"30 Nov, 2016",Saving Poroshenko? US State Dept offers $800k to Ukraine NGOs,"Washington is offering a grant of up to $800,000 to Ukrainian public organizations that will monitor regional authorities and secure ties with local media Political analysts say it s a way to keep President Petro Poroshenko in power amid declining popularity [The] goal is to enhance the accountability and responsiveness of the Ukrainian government at the local level through civilsociety advocacy, monitoring, and civic activism, ùreads a US State Department funding announcement, published this week on thegrants govwebsite It explains further that the State Department is looking for civilsociety organizations, ùeither non profit or for profit (with some conditions) that will provide proposals to perform a watchdog function and advocate for democratic governance ùin Ukraine The description states the program is aimed at increasing civic activism in Ukraine at a local level and building and training a network of civic activists throughout the country These in turn are to keep watch on the activities of local governments and encourage partnerships between civilsociety and media to communicate important information about local reforms to the public ù The organizations applying for the grant must present a program for their activities, along with a financial plan, by January 17, 2017 They are also required to have ties with thematic or in country partners, entities and relevant stakeholders, including private sector partners and NGOs ùand provide proof of these links or their potential development The description states that applicants are also requested to have demonstrable experience in administering successful, and preferably similar, projects ù It adds that: Projects should have the potential to have an immediate impact leading to long term sustainable reforms, and should have potential for sustainability beyond DRL (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor of the State Department) resources ù READ MORE:

in the implementation of the program that receives the grant It will, for instance, demand quarterly reports on the program s spending and progress Experts believe that this and other such funding opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko The Ukrainian leader s public approval ratings have plunged recently According toLiga Net, in November Poroshenko s rating drew 14 3 percent of popular support having plummeted to a low of 10 7 percent in summer He is still behind former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections, ù Shlyamin believes He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko s leadership, with his promises to introduce visa free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption proving a failure Under Poroshenko, Ukraine has so far been unable to secure europeanunion and NATO membership In domestic policy [there have been] also continuous failures, ùShlyamin told RT Russian He believes the current grant is one of the final efforts by US President Barack Obama s administration to maintain US Ukraine relations as they have been since the coup in 2014 Obama will soon leave office Therefore, he needs to have time to allocate the necessary financial resources to continue the current policy and prevent future president Donald Trump from building a new line of cooperation

"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro Clinton supporter In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton s particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4 8 years of US led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton s War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes, What s the point of having this superb military if we can t use it? And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq which was half a million dead Iraqi children was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded, We think the price is worth it Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball: Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government But it is already clear that Russia s intervention in our election on Trump s side is the real scandal of 2016 Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia s (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the real scandal of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange s torturous, slow drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind boggling list of poor decision making The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics, Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans nothing to look at here, please move on Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton s chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump s victory chances on Nov 8th And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC †chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton Trump CNN hosted debate The jaw dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate style investigation By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either But that s mere child s play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad Clinton s leaky emails point to the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of †ISIS †of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including †ISIS, that s there in those emails, the WikiLeaks co founder said There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone, he added Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of collateral damage in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We ll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers ù Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich as opposed to Russia was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr Rich ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered îat dawn îas he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild conspiracy theories, yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about Russian involvement in the WikiLeaks Although it may be perfectly true that Mr Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government îthe Russians When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America s global military footprint if elected president, neo conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American style fascism Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals like George W Bush and, yes, Barack Obama who pledge to continue America s wars of expansion and empire Clinton s past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to Make America Great Again Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures Assange òsorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t co/6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A Mussomeli in the Washington Post, of all places really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump: Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al Assad in Syria, are frightened But what really troubles them is [Trump s] generally level headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs †Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep s clothing î just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf s clothing Anne Applebaum, perennial anti Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange s work with groundless accusations: Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen Philip Breedlove †and probably others The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U S democratic process and, again, the elite ù who supposedly run it Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum s diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess Albright claimed that Russia seeks to undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr Assange, the value of that statement for themselves So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton s rat infested ship once and for all We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365545-madeleine-albright-clinton-neocon/
"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European 'forced migration',"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called colorrevolution s, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps:// tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the opensociety Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety , we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/

If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro western reformers ùand pro Russian kleptocrats ùThis is hogwash The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov) What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power And for the past two years, they ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory Something even America s influential Foreign Policy journal nowadmits There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West Furthermore, he s enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal That said, Poroshenko is described as pro Europe and his predecessor as pro Russia However, in reality, both men are pro themselves and pro money Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems The central Asians with the exception of Kazakhstan have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago Let s just look at Ukraine s figures In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller in real terms than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now To add insult to injury, it is also the world s mostunequal country When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet s most extensive rail systems A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world s largest plane, the An 225 This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now With that in mind, you d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of Marshall Plan to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming Because they know the funds would be stolen Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States ùThus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine s economic collapse is the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor ù In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal, ùPetro recently wrote However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev You see, Ukraine doesn t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia Except it s not Slovakia s gas, because that country doesn t have any of its own Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium Ukraine s completely insane economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs pic twitter com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn t want to admit that it s Russian gas This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an independence day ùmilitary parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all Aside from all this, what Poroshenko s regime can t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is Currently, it s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world If Back to the Future s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again,

"22 Jul, 2016",Welcome to the circus of US political conventions,"Annual party convention season in the United States combines comedy, farce, and melodrama in one rip roaring package of unadulterated entertainment that is to democracy what the Emperor Nero was to fire prevention The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard waving, holler whooping people bused in from every town in the country Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy eyed patriot boasts In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was Lock her up! Lock her up! ùwith all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house Trump promises to Make America Great Again, ùa sufficiently open ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean Given the billionaire s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and isless than enthusiastic about NATO This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, thegloatingover the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America s way be described as progressive Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have someinteresting friends and supporters Wall Street and George Soros prime among them who aren t exactly struggling to get by Then, too, the sympathy she s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill s notoriouscrime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end It is a two term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years?

"25 Jun, 2016",More Brussels bureaucracy: ‚ÄòBrexit may take up to 10 years to implement‚Äô,"The Tory party will drag its heels to leave the EU, says geopolitical analyst Patrick Henningsen It has already announced that Brexit is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October, followed by a change of leadership as well, he added US President Barack Obama, who paid a visit to Britain in April urging the country to stay in the EU, was one of the most vocal leaders against Brexit The White House says it doesn t welcome the results of the UK referendum, but will accept the choice of the British people RT:Does the US actually lose out in any way because of Brexit? Patrick Henningsen:They do If you look back at the history of the europeanunion , the United States in a sort of covert fashion initially anyway, post WWII was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the europeanunion And that has been learned through declassified documents and those are now publicly available It is easier for the US to wield its foreign policy agenda by dealing with one central point of contact, rather than 28 odd different states on any major issue So, certainly Washington would like to see the EU together and its special relationship with Britain makes that process all the easier when Britain has a major seat in Brussels RT:The US State Department says John Kerry wants to be part of the talks between London and Brussels But is the Brexit process really any of Washington s business? PH:That is very interesting if that is the case The reality right now is that the Tory conservative party is dragging its heels on invoking Article 50, which once it is invoked would set in motion a two year period of exits and then renegotiating Britain s terms and conditions of that exit They have already announced that it is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October and then the change of leadership as well David Cameron has already hinted this is something for the next conservative leader to do be that Boris Johnson or Theresa May So, they ve already kicked the can down an additional six months So, we are looking at an exit of a possibly five year window Some legal experts say it might be even longer than five years; it could be up to 10 years We ll see Remainers now grasping every piece of economic bad news like shipwrecked mariners reaching for flotsam RT:An EU without Britain would arguably make the Union weaker So would that actually make Europe more dependent on the US? PH:That is an interesting point I think from the US point of view, militarily this will be a big issue NATO has already announced that they stand firm with the current set up and current relationship that includes Britain being at a center of NATO However, talks of an EU military force, which have been going on behind the scenes for quite long time now, these agreements are already in place between many countries, this system of interdependency between various European militaries So, it would be very interesting to see how that plays out Certainly, that is something Washington would like to see in the future an EU defense force deployed in countries Also, Washington would like to see Turkey possibly as a member of the EU and that would extend the territory right down to the Middle East So, from the military point of view, from the Pentagon point of view, from defense contracting profit point of view this could be a fantastic market for arms and defense related industries So, that is one of Washington s main interests Plus, being able to wield its foreign policy through Brussels for sanctions against Russia, for instance, is very important for Washington Thorsten Polleit, economist and investor, Polleit & Riechert Investment Management told RT: Given the market reaction following the publication of the decision most investors were caught off guard Most people wouldn t have expected the Brits to leave the EU and that explains a lot why stock markets and particularly the pound has gone down so substantially Overtime there will be a reassessment and in particular the prospects for Great Britain are much brighter than what market reaction tells us ù RT:The euro and the pound took big hits But does that help or hinder the dollar? PH:What we saw is a flight of capital into what they call a perceived safety People perceive the dollar as a stable haven for investments So, what you saw the markets reflected exactly that You saw money transferred into dollar markets and also into gold, into hard money So, that s expected In terms of the pound devaluation of the pound at some point is not a bad thing for the British economy There are a lot of benefits in tourism and also the export benefits as well Fear mongering before the vote was: The pound is going to free fall ù George Soros even laid a veiled threat against the Brexit voters But that is not altogether a bad thing for Britain And a devalued pound doesn t hurt its balance of payments at home, paying for domestic services and benefits, which are done domestically anyway So, I don t think there are major shock waves there ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/348350-uk-eu-us-exit/
"8 Jun, 2016",‚ÄòWest promoting lie of Russian aggression to boost NATO forces in Europe‚Äô,"Even in the US many people are looking outside to get more objective information and analysis, Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of the Pan African News Wire, told RT The US media is not a free press; it is corporate controlled, he added The US Senate held a series of hearings on Tuesday with the aim of information gathering for future policymaking A number of key domestic issues were supposed to be discussed However, federal officials seemed to care more about another headache for the US, and that s Russian aggression Addressing Russian aggression , US officials went the extra mile to break down the threat of Russia s mass disinformation ù They even namedropped RT as one of the means of Russian propaganda RT:Why are US officials and Victoria Nuland in particular so obsessed with Russia? Abayomi Azikiwe:Because stations like RT and other media sources outside of the US are getting hundreds of millions of viewers and readers; even inside the US many people are looking outside to get more objective information and analysis The US media is not a free press; it is a corporate controlled media Even the so called National Public media in the US if you look most of the people who speak in that media come from the corporate sector They are very concerned about controlling information It is not unusual that Victoria Nuland would come with a pack of lies She is quite accustomed to doing that Remember, this is the same Mrs Nuland who was giving away cookies to extremist Ukrainians during the so called revolt in Ukraine, which had been financed and had been supported by the forces and the money of George Soros and others in order to pull Ukraine away from Russia and create really a pre war situation in the East It is not true what Nuland said they have tried for 20 years to get a good relationship with Russia William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT RT:US officials continue to talk about so called Russian aggression Where is this aggression that Russia poses such a threat to the US AA:They don t clearly spell it out because the US and NATO have Russia surrounded on many fronts: In Europe, in Eastern Europe That continuing encirclement is spreading to other parts of the world, including Asia and Africa They have the US Africa Command So, it is the US, the State Department, the CIA, NATO these are the military alliances that have more bases than any other country throughout the world and they are in fact escalating aggression against Russia and other countries that don t toe the line of the State Department RT:Do all these hearings and discussions between American officials on propaganda mean that they are losing this battle? AA:I believe they are Because particularly among a lot of young people inside the US they are looking for information outside the corporate media Most of them do not get their news from the major media outlets that are promoted by the corporate interests and by the government So, they are concerned that you don t have this type of anti Russian, anti Chinese, anti Iranian type of slant to the media orientation So, when you have people inside the US that are watching RT, and are watching other stations outside the US, this poses a challenge to their control of information and how people view the world Mrs Nuland is one of the real perpetrators of this because she has been in it from the get go And she is taking a personal responsibility in trying to really destroy Russia as a powerful nation And that is why there is an obsession here that President Putin has reacted and has reacted strongly because he wants to defend the sovereignty of Russia And therefore the US and people like Nuland not the entire US, but some of the leadership are reacting very strongly to this William Jonesfrom Executive Intelligence Review to RT RT:Is it possible to repair ties with another country if you are always claiming them to be a threat to you? AA:It is very difficult to establish any type of fair and just relations when this intense competition is being fostered even on a mass communications level So, this is something the US State Department has to look at seriously but they are still in all appearances, committed to world hegemony ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/345860-us-russia-propaganda-nuland/
"8 May, 2016",Russia: The new baddie ‚Äì again,"Each leader the West wants to take down is really the same stock character brought back in slightly different attire after the commercial break; Saddam, Gaddafi and Assad are all the same guy: the archetypal Darth Vader to our Luke Skywalker Within this simplistic, childlike meta narrative nothing the baddies do can be good As those in charge of our propaganda know, the vague, malevolent force which characterizes all our baddies is a much better reason to attack them than anything based in reality Thus, baddies have no convincing backstory They are evil because well, just because And that is precisely why they must be overcome While the West had other countries to trash, it let Russia slide in and out of various tenuous sub plots But now that Western enemies in the Middle East are burning nicely, the script has space for the development of a new central baddie as the prelude to Well, we all know what One struggles to remember a time when Russia could do anything right in the eyes of Western media It liked the end of the Cold War and the Yeltsin era when Russia was handing over the nation s wealth to non Russian interests; a people elbowing each other out of the way in a fight for shiny trinkets that was acceptable The pre story to that drama was the deal Gorbachev cut with the US Under Gorbachev, the USpromisednot to encroach on Russia s sphere of influence a fact now denied by the US, naturally But at the time it was true, and it gave Russia the confidence it needed to let Communism go and allow personal initiative to find a level Fast forward thirty years and NATO is busy fillingPolandwith troops, and claims outrage when Russia monitors its activities in theBaltics However, when the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to re join Russia, this result was rejected by Western media as lacking any legitimacy Russians now get it that in the post Soviet stage play called international politics anyone with traditional values who doesn t clap wildly when his own side takes a hit will be hissed at while the piano clangs away menacingly in the corner They understand that talk about fairness, democracy, choice and equality is just that: talk They have seen how globalism works And unsurprisingly they aren t interested in much more of it In a BBC piece purporting to measure attitudes towards what it calls global citizenship , Russia isidentifiedas the most backward country on earth Feeling like a global citizen (i e having abandoned all the values your grandfather would have laid his life down to uphold) is assumed by the BBC to be the very definition of virtue Spain is found to be the country most wholeheartedly throwing itself over the cliff edge, with what the piece calls an eye catching majority of 84 percent believing that they should take in more of those fleeing the five year civil war in Syria The fallacies are instantly obvious to anyone with a functioning brain: Syria s civil war is entirely the result of sustained attacks by western money and mercenaries, and four out of five refugees arenot from Syria Syria was slated by the US for what it calls regime change i e unilaterally going into a country which had done it no harm and committing mass murder in order to hand that country over to the same central banking system which runs everywhere else The source for this plan was disclosed by none other than General Wesley Clark But none of that matters The main thing is that globalism is super fab, and if you don t want more of it, you re backward and probably deserve theeconomic warwaged against you because you don t roll over in the face of NATO or Soros backed aggression Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski that master of how things actually are rather than how we are told to think about them famously said: Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves They ll only be able to parrot the information they ve been given on the previous night s news ù He was right Western publics are nothing if not malleable Not only is the ability to reason independently largely absent, people also have little or no memory And their attitudes towards Russia are no exception Having spent the last few years in Europe, I am constantly impressed by how immune to either facts or reason the general population is People will say in all seriousness that Putin is behind the current invasion of Europe repeating theclaimput out there by former NATO chief US General Philip Breedlove, who has been replaced by General Curtis M Scaparrotti, a man who is busy moving all his pieces into the very spaces on Russia s border the US promised never to occupy Resurgent Russia : New hardline#NATOEurope commander raises hackles in Moscowhttps:// tdotco /DDNNywPuPHpic twitter com/wrSAxrUwG8 Under Yelstin, Russia was nothing but an economic target; weak and failing, and selling off the family silver for pennies on the dollar while signing wholesale into law legislation handed to it by US NGOs with agendas entirely inimical to those of the Russian people Yet in the bed time story version of events for popular western consumption, Yeltsin was a goodie Had his successor continued in the same vein allowing foreign interests to asset strip the country the narrative today, doubtless, would be that Russia is free I have seen enough of how realpolitik works not to expect anything from any government ever beyond intrusion into my life and the appropriation of a proportion of what I generate I regard belief in government per se as a sort of weakness So while I understand westerners who rightly disillusioned by their own countries choose to see Putin as a lone hero fighting a rear guard action against globalism, I don t exactly share their sentiments One can t help but have a twinge of envy when looking at Russia s Putin Firstly, he is both bright and sober When a journalist asks him a question, he has the ability to answer it well and often with humor Even given the hopeless translations into English in the media, at least some of what is in the original Russian comes across Secondly, he is professional He demonstrates an appropriate CEO level grasp on his responsibilities Thirdly, he describes the world and acts within it like a man who regards people in his own country as his principle stakeholders Whether this is in fact the case is at least in my opinion impossible to tell But it makes for a refreshing and enjoyable narrative In the West, we are simply not used to this type of presentation Given the controlled demolition of Europe, it is clear now to those who retain their natural instincts that those who make the big decisions in Europe are simply acting liketraitors Thus, at the level of narrative, the Western propaganda machine is left with a thorny plot point to resolve Since relative to Putin the goodies have made themselves look decidedly Darth Vadery around the gills, the implication is obvious to anyone who knows how stories work: the Force is now with Putin This is highly problematic; a narrative meltdown The confusion and dilution of the villain archetype mid drama as anyone who has followed Star Wars will know can mean only one thing: that a brand new, conflict heavy storyline is on its way @SamGerrans ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/342285-russia-new-baddie-again/
"9 Apr, 2016",Why Sitting Bull was right about Washington‚Äôs lack of integrity,"That integrity is a foreign land where Washington is concerned is an inarguable fact In the latest example, the failure to complete the construction of a nuclear disposal plant agreed with Russia once again leaves Washington s credibility in tatters Underlying this issue is the attempt by the US federal government to alter the terms of theagreementit signed with Russia in 2000 for the disposal of weapons grade plutonium, with each country building industrial plants with this specific objective in mind Russia has kept its side of the bargain and, at no small cost, built the facility required to dispose of its excess nuclear material in the manner agreed The US on the other hand is now looking at an alternative method of disposal, which amounts to storing said material in a process that allows it to retain its breakout potential ù i e its ability to be converted back into weapons grade plutonium Not what we agreed on : Processing method swap violates US Russian plutonium dealhttps:// tdotco /kePBWpIv3qpic twitter com/EA3MiCeGWl Given the record of subterfuge and double dealing on the part of successive US governments when it comes to its failure to honour treaties and agreements, nobody should be surprised Indeed, this subterfuge is so common where Washington is concerned that you could be forgiven for considering it a quintessentially American trait Since 2000 alone, the record in this regard makes stark reading The willfully false assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of WMD, for example, was used as justification for one of the most disastrous wars ever unleashed, certainly in modern times, which only succeeded in plunging Iraq and the wider entire region into a dark night of terrorism and sectarian bloodletting It is a state of affairs that shows no evidence of abating anytime soon, 13 years later Following on from that, when Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, he did so as the supposed antidote to the arrogance and mendacity that typified the Bush years before him One of his very first pledges upon taking office was that he would close of the controversial US prison facility, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, during his first term in office It was a pledge and an announcement that met with support across the world, given that along with rendition, waterboarding and torture, the very name Guantanamo conjured up his predecessor s war on terror, ù which replaced international law with might is right as the cornerstone of global affairs Yet despite Obama s pledge, 15 years later Guantanamo remains in operation Behind its bars 37 inmates, denied the right to due process, continue to be held in a state of legal limbo Compounding the scandal of this US military prison facility is the fact it exists on Cuba s sovereign territory despite repeated demands by the Cuban government for it to be returned More recently, we have had the scandal of thePanama Papers, containing evidence of mass and wholesale financial and tax impropriety by leading politicians, corporate executives and the super rich However, an even bigger story has been the politicization of the information contained within these papers throughout the Western media, involving a transparent attempt to smear Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, even though neither his name nor the name of any member of his family appears anywhere in them This is no surprise considering that the misnamed International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), based in Washington, is the body responsible for leaking the information to the media The ICIJ is the international arm of the US Center for Public Integrity, an organization that counts among its major donors George Soros s opensociety Foundation, Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and the Carnegie Endowment, among others This has to explain why out of all the people whose names have been leaked thus far there are conspicuously few American citizens among them Do they really expect us to believe that the US is immune to financial corruption? Really? Wall Street, the global financial crisis, the land of corporate greed and malfeasance, yet up to now not one major name from the world of politics, business, or banking is included within the Panama Papers? With this in mind, it really doesn t take a genius to discern the agenda being pursued here This brings us back to this latest example of US bad faith and lack of integrity when it comes to fulfilling its agreements and international obligations vis √† vis Russia By now, Moscow should be accustomed to being lied to by Washington Whether it is the assurances given to the last Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev that upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union there would be no eastward expansion of NATO, which were not kept, or the manipulation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 to effect regime change in Libya by NATO, time and again the US government, either unilaterally or via Washington controlled international bodies, has proved that not only its word but its official stamp on treaties and agreements is meaningless In this regard, the words of none other than Sitting Bull have proved eerily prescient over the generations since the great Indian warrior chief uttered them There are things they tell us that sound good to hear, but when they have accomplished their purpose they will go home and will not try to fulfill our agreements with them Sitting Bull s analysis of Washington and its integrity has stood the test of time ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/339039-plutonium-us-russia-deal-panama/

"21 Mar, 2016",Brazil's revolution starting to reveal its true colors,"As we approach High Noon in the savage Brazilian politico economic western, here s what is at stake following my previous piece on RT For the past five days, all hell has broken loose Itstartedwith judge Sergio Moro, the tropical Elliott Ness at the head of the two year old, 24 phase Car Wash corruption investigation, crudely manipulating an illegal phone tapping of a Lula Dilma Rousseff conversation, which he duly leaked to corporate media and was instantly used as proof ùthat Lula may be back in power as Chief of Staff because he s afraid ùof Elliott Ness As a crucial instance of the total information war currently at play in Brazil with the hegemonic Globo media empire and the major newspapers salivating for a white coup/regime change more than ever the shaky proof ùturbocharged the Rousseff impeachment drive to a whole new level The appalling politicization of the Brazilian Judiciary is now a fait accompli, with many a judge moved by opportunism and/or corporate interest/shady political agendas That implies a normalization ùof illegal procedures such as phone tapping of defense lawyers and even the President (Edward Snowden, in a lightweight aside, commented that Rousseff is still not using cryptography in her communications) Supreme Court ministers at least so far have not punished Elliott Ness for his illegal tapping of the President s phone and for his illegal leaking of the Lula Rousseff conversation (there s nothing in it to implicate them in any wrongdoing, as Elliott Ness himself admitted) The next cliffhanger was Supreme Court minister Gilmar Mendes a notorious opposition puppet using the illegal phone tapping to suspend Lula s new role; that was required ùfrom him by two opposition parties Lula back in government means two anathemas for the white coup/regime change crowd; political articulation which may end up by defeating the impeachment drive against Rousseff; and fundamental help for the Rousseff administration to start at least taming the economic crisis It s crucial to note that Mendes s unilateral decision was taken only a day and a half after he had a long lunch with two opposition heavyweights, one of them Wall Street darling banker and former Soros prot√©g√© Arminio Fraga Mendes not only pushed the administration into a corner; he went further, handing back to Elliott Ness the competence to investigate Lula under Car Wash, and this after Moro himself had already been forced, by law, to transfer the jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, as Lula was to become a minister Mendes was not competent to do it as even other Supreme Court judges stressed; he took it away from the minister speaker of Car Wash in the Supreme Court, Teori Zavascki So now it s up to Zavascki to affirm his competence ùin the matter Essentially the phone tapping leak is crammed with serious illegalities, as a smatter of jurists has pointed out; from the tapping taking place after Moro himself determined they should be discontinued, to the leak of a Presidential communication, which could only be authorized by the Supreme Court Which leads us to the hidden political agenda behind the leak: to expose Lula to public execration and pit him against politicians and the Judiciary Lula has presented a habeas corpus request to the Supreme Court, signed by some of Brazil s top jurists, while the government is about to present its own appeal against the blocking of Lula s nomination The ball is with the Supreme Court and all bets are off The Brazilian Supreme Court in fact has ceased to act as a Supreme Arbiter as some of its members refuse to admit all the current trappings of a police state This is happening while a rash of prosecutors and a gaggle of investigators at the Brazilian Federal Police the equivalent of the FBI now can be identified as mere pawns of the ultra politicized Car Wash investigation In a nutshell: Justice ù in Brazil is now totally politicized And Car Wash s mandate is now revealed to clearly consist in the outright criminalization of absolutely anything related to the coalition governments led by the Workers Party since the beginning of the first Lula term in 2003 Car Wash is not about the cleansing of corruption in Brazilian politics; if that really was the target, top opposition politicians would be under investigation, and many behind bars already Moreover, the appalling corruption scheme in the development of Sao Paulo s metro lines would not have been treated only as the working of a cartel of companies, with no politicians involved; the Sao Paulo metro racket follows the same logic of the corruption scheme discovered by the NSA inside Petrobras Rule of law ùin Brazil has now been debased to Turkey s Sultan Erdogan levels featuring business leaders with the wrong ùpolitical connections arrested for months without trial, which translates as blatant manipulation of public opinion, the preferred tactic of Mani Pulite fan Moro and his team The road map ahead is grim The Brazilian Constitution is being torn to shreds, submitted to a white coup logic to be enforced by all means necessary The politicization of the Judiciary runs in parallel to the mainstream media spectacularization of everything that the process touches, criminalizing politics but only selected politicians Brazil s hugely concentrated economic interests are willing to support any deal that would mean an endgame to the political/judicial war, as politico economically the country remains totally paralyzed and polarized Inside the immensely corrupt Brazilian Congress, a special commission to deliberate over Rousseff s impeachment has been appointed, including 36 dodgy members of Parliament who are facing myriad judicial problems; Kafka or the Dadaists would not come up with anything as absurd So the road map ahead now depends on how this dodgy impeachment commission will progress or not One of the possible scenarios is Rousseff s ouster as early as late April, even if she has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing; the usual Empire of Chaos suspects and the local comprador elites barely contain their glee as they inform ùBloomberg or the Wall Street Journal But then there s the Lula factor Assuming Lula may be back in action in the next few days, extensive political articulation which the opposition wants to kill by all means will need 171 votes to smash the impeachment drive in the lower house; only then may the administration defuse the political crisis to seriously tackle the economic crisis In a cliffhanger heavy, extremely fluid scenario, there would be only two possible negotiated solutions: a sort of legal ersatz Parliamentarism, with Rousseff still as President, and Lula as a de facto Prime Minister; and an all out ersatz Parliamentarism, with Lula in charge of all the government s political articulations A pact forged during secret ùdinners in Brasilia between the PSDB (the former social democrats turned neoliberal enforcers) and the PMDB party (the other major cog in the Workers Party ruling coalition) has been sealed to kill both options The PMDB, incidentally, is notorious for what else corrupt politicians, not as a governing entity All eyes are now on the Supreme Court and the wallowing in corruption Brazilian Congress Lula, in the eye of the hurricane itself, is in the most unenviable position He will need to use all his political capital and all his decades as a master negotiator to find a (political compromise) way out The Brazilian street remains totally radicalized; the logic (?) of blind hate prevails while virtually all instances of juridical or political mediation, not to mention plain, civilized common sense, have been frozen Brazilian democracy one of the healthiest in the world is now being strangled by the warped python logic of a police state Which brings us to the tawdry scenario that might as well play out before summer A cowardly, very conservative CongressexpelsRoussef from power; the Vice President, PMDB s Temer, steps in, the country is pacified ùand the proverbial foreign investors, Wall Street, the Koch brothers in the US, hail the white coup; the Car Wash hysteria slowly and magically fades out because no way former opposition mandarins should be indicted or go to jail (that s only for the Workers Party) Kafka and the Dadaists to the rescue, again; this is exactly the soft ùregime change deal that has been clinched in Brasilia by a nasty combo; selected (corrupt) politicians bought and paid for by the Brazilian comprador elites; selected businessmen; a large part of a co opted Judiciary; and corporate media (ruled by four families) Call it white coup Call it regime change Call it the Brazilian color revolution Without NATO Without humanitarian ùimperialism Without blood and zillions of US dollars lost, like in Iraq, Libya or Syria So clean ù So lawful ù How come Empire of Chaos s theoreticians never thought about this before?

"5 Mar, 2016","I'm confused, can anyone help me? Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I m confused Very confused Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately weaponizing the migration/refugee crisis to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia s intervention in Syria on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011 Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011 so surely it s more accurate to accuse them of weaponising the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government We want people to come back to Syria, hesaidin February Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back, he said, asreportedby Telesur And this is the man who along with Putin we are told is deliberately weaponising migration by the NATO commander? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused very confused in fact by the portrayal of Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton as a progressive who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be the lesser of two evils Now, from what I ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and regime changer whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton s foreign policy record in this 2015article Among Hillary s boasts are that she urged her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia The innocent civilians killed in the illegal humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton urged included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces Four years later, Hillary sided with hard right republicanparty hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS You don t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny We came We saw He died! Last week on George Galloway s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party s Dr Jill Stein told us Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support How does Clinton s record make her progressive ? Or has the word progressive today been redefined to mean an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge fund billionaire GeorgeSoros I m confused Can anyone help me? The EU referendum Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo But I m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for Brexit in June s Referendum We retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for national security and in order todealwith Russian aggression Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support @DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic twitter com/evltbtGyuo We re told a Brexit would shock the world economy And the UK itself wouldbreak up But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn t in the EEC/EU And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of 550m As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: The public finances were also in rude health a borrowing requirement of 1 96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of 600m by the end of 1969 And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969 Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre EEC accession era, but the UK wasn t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv) So our national security clearly didn t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it s a different world today But Norway and Switzerland aren t in the EU and didn t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people Leading bankers City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders Tony Blair They can t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m confused still confused about the ongoing investigation into the MH 17 plane disaster After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong evidence that the plane was shot down by a surface to air missile We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft, said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014 But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators Now if it was so clear cut that rebels supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused about what we ve been told by western political figures about Russia s intervention in Syria When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and moderate Syria opposition forces You have a strong propaganda message that says you re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it,‚ÄùUK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a warning shot for Russia But if Russia hadn t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we ve seen renewed allegations that Russia isn t hitting IS But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January: It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary This is no longer the case How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS s air force Surely IS would be advancing if Russia s campaign was really aiding the group? I m confused Can anyone help me? Finally I m confused about Turkey and British support for democratic values British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a long standing goal for Britain His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an important ally Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan s government is steamrolling over human rights,‚Äùsays Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid: The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated Impunity for human rights abuses persisted The independence of the judiciary was further eroded Now, neocons always tell us that they re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond? Instead of condemning Turkey s undemocratic crackdowns, Hammond tweets about extending sanctions on Russia Agreed at#AmiensFGBon need to keep EU sanctions against Russia until full#Minskagreement implementation#Ukrainepic twitter com/RqAooF4UPV The accessioncriteriafor membership of the EU includes: stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities Why are neocons so keen on Turkey joining the EU when its clear that these conditions are not met?I m confused Can anyone help me?

"25 Feb, 2016",Ukraine's 'Song for Europe' violates the spirit of Eurovision,"The propaganda war against Russia is waged on many fronts Even, I regret to say, in an international song contest which is supposed to be above politics is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Ukraine has chose for its entry to this year s Eurovision Song Contest, 1944 , a song all about the forced deportation of 240,000 Crimean Tatars ordered by the dictator Joseph Stalin in the 1940s Never mind the contest s rules which bans songs of an overtly political nature; never mind the fact that Stalin was not the leader of Russia but the Soviet Union, and that he was a Georgian and not a Russian Despite all that, let s use Eurovision to engage in some crude Russia bashing, shall we? I m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily 1944 opens with the chilling description: When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we re not guilty ù I had to write it It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it, ùsaysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar Armenian family I m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow, went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry Ding a dong, performed by Teach In back in 1975 But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead singer of Teach In Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia There s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done especially if, like me, you are a long standing Eurovision fan who s been watching the event since the 1970s The provocative, politically motivated decision to chose 1944 as their Song for Europe goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons When Johnny Logan performed What s Another Year , the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn t singing about the Anglo Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of 1944 ? Believe it or not, it s not just Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars who have had some very bad things done to them in the past The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999 The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars Russia could sing about the 5 7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France s invasion of 1812 The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years And so on Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities and even genocides Few countries in Europe haven t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point and on top of that there s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on and singing about today It s not the first time those with an anti Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: We don t Wanna Put In The artists did not deny their song was a protest against Russian policies The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so Therulesof Eurovision state that No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest ùUkraine s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There s method in Kiev s apparent madness If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she just had to write , in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent We ll all be under pressure to give the song Douze Points to show our solidarity with Ukraine If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that free speech is under threat in Europe because we can t hear 1944 I m sure we ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala The West s free speech crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites They didn t say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year s Eurovision not for the lyrics of their song, which was called Wars for nothing but because one of the captions in the song s videocontainedthe words: 2014 Gaza two thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children Israel wasn t mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war But that didn t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary s broadcasting authority, with the result that the offending words in the video were removed While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting Israel who s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests Hungary s Eurovision entry there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting Wars for nothing Already the sort of media outlets you d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and 1944 Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them I would not want to see history repeat itself, Jamalatoldthe US Congress funded station RFE/RL is smart power Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for, saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics! The Ukrainian authorities are going to try to use the song capitalizing on the tragedy of the Tartars to impose on European viewers a false picture of alleged harassment of the Tartars in the Russian Crimea, Crimea s deputy prime minister Russlan Balbek hassaid He s right to be offended The head of Ukraine s National Remembrance Museum has also done his best tostir things up He said that should Jamala win the contest in Stockholm, next year s event would be held in Sevastopol Now there s just one small problem with that Sevastopol is no longer part of Ukraine It s part of Russia The city council of Sevastopol has declared that the only way it could host Eurovision 2017 is if Russia wins this year Does Ukraine really want us to go to war over where the Eurovision Song Contest is held? To debase an international song contest in the way that Ukraine has done is disgraceful By focusing on crimes which occurred in the 1940s, Jamala is also helping to divert international attention away from the economic plight of Ukraine today A country that was once the food basket of eastern Europe is now, thanks to the illegal US/EU sponsored coup of 2014, a veritable basket case It s hard to get one s head round the figures Ukraine s foreign trade has slumped 31 percent in just one year Ukraine s foreign trade collapses 31% in just one year, post EU backed couphttps:// tdotco /xVfNUpkOiH Inflation last February wasestimatedto be running at 64 5 percent a month Ukraine s GDP meanwhile fell for six successive quarters following the democratic revolution of February 2014, while real wages fell by almost 25 percent in the year May 2014 May 2015 The people in Maidan were supposed to protesting against corruption, but Ukraine surprise, surprise, remains themost corruptnation in Europe In fact, looking at how wretched everyday life is for ordinary people in liberated Ukraine today, one can fully understand why Jamala is so keen to take us back to 1944 If she was really brave, she d have penned a song called 2014 that discussed the regime change activities of Victoria Nuland and their consequences She handed us cookies out in the square, and when we next looked at our wage packets, there was nothing there You can follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization úTV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333580-ukraines-song-europe-jamala/
"18 Feb, 2016",What matters most: Human rights or the rights of Western governments?,"It seemed unthinkable that after the Iraq tragedy and the ensuing chaos that followed the 2003 US led war there would ever be any support for another attack on an Arab country And yet eight years after the invasion of Iraq, international opinion almost unanimously supported NATO operations in Libya Conveniently labeled no fly zone at inception, the idea was to wage war against Muammar Gaddafi and force him out of office, like Saddam Hussein before him The escalation from simply stopping Libyan planes from flying to bombing raids would not have been acceptable to an ever increasingly skeptical public without the much needed support of the human rights industry This prosperous sector operates the easily marketable commodity that is humanity The idea is that some organizations, based in Western capitals, have a moral imperative to decide what humanity is and how it should be dispensed Their respectability should derive from their fairness, objectivity and commitment to justice That of course is in principle, in reality their objectives are shaped by those who fund them and allow them to operate In the case of Human Rights Watch, one of the most high profile NGOs today, its connection to the US government was so intimate that notable academics and scholars penned a letter in 2014 criticizing its executive director s close links or revolving door policy with the US State Department That relationship is so cozy that while many grassroots activist have denounced the US over police brutality or the disproportionate number of black victims as well as the number of inmates currently held in custody without trial it begs the question of why would a human rights organization which aims to dispense its values to numerous governments across the world appear so blind to the very abuses committed on its own doorstep The answer is that HRW, today viewed as one of the two major human rights organizations alongside Amnesty, only looks at the errors committed by countries whose politics the US disapproves of HRW favors an interventionist agenda and as a result supports almost all wars waged by the US under the cover of humanitarian responsibility, even when the consequences of these military operations would always lead to increased human suffering In the case of the conflict in Syria, HRW s Ken Roth, at the helm of the organization far longer than the average Arab president remains in power, was pushing the now debunked story of Assad forces using chemical weapons against civilians in Ghouta His public statementsthrough social media contradicted even UN reports carried out on the ground in a bid to pursue what he qualifies as a responsibility to protect ù However, that responsibility ùis often carried out through bombing operations The approach in the US is that a Western response is always best and that ultimately only Westerners know best ù Despite boasting divisions for each region of the world (Africa division/Middle East division etc ) the staff manning these sections are almost all exclusively American with only local researchers appointed to junior or mid ranking positions With all the intellectual competence in these various geographies, it should have seemed reasonable to expect senior figures in an organization with an international outlook to have a more international team and yet that is far from the case to this day When even its largest donor, multi billionaire George Soros argues that HRW has to be more effective and be seen as more international, less an American organization, ùsomething is clearly wrong But when Soros donates a staggering$100 millionto an outfit with such proven ties to the US government what does he expect in exchange? In these times of war and climatic instability, feeding the hungry and providing health care to the ill would take priority over offering a huge sum of money to an organization that already operates on a very comfortablebudgetof around $50 million per year George Soros is no ordinary man; he is one of the wealthiest financiers on the planet who has made no secret of where his politics lie Earlier this month, hewrotein the UK s Guardian that Russia sPresident Putinwas one of the greatest threats to Europe While appearing to be critical of both sides on the Ukraine Russia tension, HRW continues to portray Russia as a brutal dictatorship that allows no dissent feeding into the now deeply ingrained perception across much of the West that Russia constitutes a major threat to Europe, another one sided view that is in accordance with US policy and not internationally, where Russia enjoys far greater support outside Europe and North America Another interesting appointment was that of Tom Malinowski in 2001 He was Senior Director on the National Security Council at the White House, before becoming Washington Director for Human Rights Watch Since he left HRW he has returned to a US government position where he nowservesas Assistant Secretary in the Bureau for Democracy in the State Department Because of its close ties to US officials as well as donors with very clear agendas, HRW has seen its credibility suffer a major blow More nuanced organizations such as Amnesty International operate far more effectively due in great part to their astute politics Avoiding all the pitfalls, HRW fell into, AI has in recent years been the respectable face of the now discredited human rights industry and yet its support for avoidable wars has been just as serious if not worse While present in the early days of the Libyan uprisings, AI teams were able to witness the absence of massacres reported across the Western media Keen to sell a necessary war to Western audiences some rebels were courting Western outfitsspeaking of10,000 protesters slaughtered in a matter of days later proven to be false AI hadissuedstatements with headlines pointing almost exclusively to government forces attacks before stating, some paragraphs below, that both sides ùwere committing atrocities The attention grabbing headlines were enough to make the casus belli stronger and analysts and observers, incapable of questioning the motives behind the misleading headlines, would later be unable to challenge such subversive descriptions of the conflict, a conflict that would eventually leave Libya a failed state in the hands of various terrorist groups As with most if not all NGOs, AIfocusesalmost exclusively on violations of human rights committed in third world countries therefore giving the impression that violations are only committed outside the West While its members continuously campaign for African leaders to be handed over to The Hague to face prosecutions for war crimes, it is yet to make any public pronouncement on the former British prime minister s role in the war in Iraq, despite Britain being a signatory to the International Criminal Court of justice It has therefore become a comforting short cut to denounce government politics while turning to human rights organizations representing a moral compass, albeit in accordance with Western opinion While some projects are at times commendable, it appears that these operations close relationships with Western authority points to a sinister agenda that simply sugar coats the horrors of war Human rights should be about ensuring people live in dignity and sheltered from unnecessary violence What the human rights industry has provided is a new narrative: if you die as a result of a Western bomb ùthan you ve been responsibly protected ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332877-human-rights-watch-soros/
"24 Jan, 2016",Invasion of Europe: The ship is going down,"It is sobering to realize that the supposed captains on the ship your forebears built over millennia are willfully detonating the bulkheads and drilling large holes in the hull whilst claiming there is nothing anyone could possibly have done The K√ºbler Ross model of trauma describes the emotional pathway for any European with an interest in protecting the continent his forebears created from the perfidy of national leaders whose actions will breed him and his children out of existence First there was denial: surely Angela Merkel couldn t be so stupid as to sink the European ship? Next came anger as news of theorganized attacksby so called asylum seekers on European white women seeped through the checkpointsembeddedin the mainstream media machine Then came the stage known as bargaining as people thought they would settle for somerestrictions on numbersso long as the tidal wave was stopped And now we are at enforced acceptance: the tidal wave will not stop so get used to it with Jeremy Corbyn, for example,callingfor the UK to take similar numbers as Germany If you feel like you didn t vote for any of this, that s because you didn t Your opinion isn t worth the paper it s written on It s people likeGeorge Soroswho are making these decisions Your job is to shut up, pay taxes, and learn toget on boardwith this new round of social engineering and ethnic cleansing But now that it is obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that hand wringing apart the fix is in, it is interesting to observe how career politicians are talking now that the dust is settling on the new reality Because talk is all that they will do We are at the tipping point And once we get over that, the ship is going down, make no mistake The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, for example, has managed albeit belatedly to get an intellectual handle on what s going on: the refugee crisis isdestabilizingEurope Now, he does not mean what you and I mean by Europe: our countries, nations, languages and histories He s aBilderbergerso he has at least a mid level understanding of the actual plan and doesn t care about any of the things the people who vote for him care about He means the Union of European Soviet Socialist Republics; the Brussels oligarchy in other words The Guardianwrites: He said a message to refugees that said Come, you will be welcome ù provoked major shifts in population His grasp of the obvious now it is too late to do anything about it is impressive The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Europe was close to breaking point: We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks ùBut, he went on: No one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair weather system then it cannot survive ù Geert Wilders is described by the liberal press as a far right Dutch politician This means he has stayed roughly where our grandparents were while everyone else was processed by Cultural Marxism Wilders has called for the invading, marauding males to be locked up in asylum centers and for the safety of Dutch women and girls to be put first What a novel idea This isn t far right It is just right But, we already know, it will never happen RTinterviewedHansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party Mueller said: Germany now is somewhere at the edge of anarchy and sliding towards civil war, or to become a banana republic without any government He went on: Bavaria is the first region because we are affected the most we are living on the border to Austria where the influx of refugees stems from But the second regions of Germany where this happens are Saxony and Thuringia First of all, they have also borders to the Czech Republic, that s the first reason And the second reason is that in former Eastern Germany people are still aware of what it is living in a dictatorship They are feeling quite well that our so called democracy is sliding more and more towards a totalitarian state Interesting and objectively correct words But then Mueller does not hold any real power Donald Tusk, on the other hand as chief apparatchik in the European Soviet machine does have power He nowwarnsthat we have only two months to get things under control This means, of course, when after two months the invasion is only worse, we will be expected to accept the situation asfait accompli Tusk also has a holy reverence for the nonsense known as the Schengen Agreement and warned that if Europe fails to make the strategy work we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen, ùthe 26 nation passport free travel zone How complicated is it? There is nothing holy about the Schengen Agreement the UK is not party to it, for example But European leaders talk about it as though it weresomehow problematicto revoke it It s not The Schengen is an idea The invasion of Europe and the destruction of the ancient cultures within it, however, is very real If these were not refugees but infantrymen (even ones without guns) arriving from let s say North Korea, this problem would not have got to first base This is an invasion But because it is dressed up in the garb Europeans fall for every time the language of compassion we are now in a state where European womencannot walk unmolestedin their own streets oruse public poolswithout being subjected to degradation Given the political will, this problem can be fixed in a five minute conversation It s a group Skype call at best The fact that this doesn t happen belies the reality: the fix is in, and politicians like Valls and apparatchiks like Tusk are trying to distance themselves from the inevitable fallout This is why they are saying things they think people will want to hear: not because they are going to step up and do what is necessary, but because they don t want the coming chaos attached to their names The solution is obvious: stop saving all the ships arriving in Europe; put officers with real powers on borders, and have anyone without a passport or other valid ID immediately ejected from the EU space And border guards both at the peripheries of individual countries and the EU itself should be told in clear and uncertain terms what their job is: to protect what s behind them from what s in front of them If EU border guards pay was inversely indexed to the number of persons shown to have entered the EU illegally and if internal police had equivalent motivations this problem would be solved in a month If there is a genuine case for asylum based on the existing legal framework the place for that discussion is on the border of the EU, not within it Germany has followed Switzerland inconfiscating the assetsof refugees over a certain value shown to befour figure sumson average This will do nothing other than ensure that the next wave comes with nothing, or has it sent over in parcels later The real causes for invasion lie with neo colonialism and the banking cartel which drives it philanthropists such as Soros and NATO s genocide against Libya and the murder of Gaddafi who was holding back the population floodgates for us NATO has no compunction about killing people in very large numbers when it suits the bankers agenda The fact that Europe s military is pussy footing around now that we actually need soldiers to do their only legitimate job defend our borders suddenly everyone is Albert Schweitzer The case is so plain, even 16 year old German girls with no previous interest in politics are getting it Anyone who suggests taking effective action is labelled far right by the liberal media which panders to those whose intellects are bypassed by means of emotional trigger words such as compassion But the motif of the ship is a fair one When a ship goes down there are never enough lifeboats Sailors are trained to beat off with violence those still in the sea once the lifeboat is full If they do not everyone dies This is real compassion If there is a silver lining in this tale of corruption and perfidy it is this: the liberal s catch all justification for his crimes against his own people that of pleading compassion is no longer beyond criticism People have had enough Wanting your family and your culture to survive does not make you evil This is not a game; it is deadly serious And if the helm cannot be wrest from those bent on taking the ship down, it s time for those with the wit and the means to make a quiet move for the exits @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/329961-invasion-europe-migrants-brussels/

 /files/opinionpost/37/c1/b0/00/2530092_obana_new mp4 As if on command, thousands of Ukrainians suddenly poured into
 the streets of Kiev to protest the decision Such a rapid
 reaction should not have come as a surprise After all, a
 multitude of US government agencies most notably, USAID had
 been operating in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
 investing billions on its latest democratic pet
 project This is no conspiracy theory On December 13, 2013, Assistant
 Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, following her third trip to
 Ukraine in five weeks, told the National Press Club: Since
 Ukraine s independence in 1991 the United States has invested
 over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in needs and other goals Exactly what those other goals may have been, and who
 helped underwrite them, seem rather obvious today Although many are tempted to believe otherwise, governments don t
 normally spend such prodigious sums of money in a foreign land
 unless it expects to get something hefty in this case, Kiev s
 loyalty in return Governments are by nature political
 opportunists, not philanthropists, which is precisely why Russia
 gave USAID the boot in 2012 Ukraine did not, and was forced to
 pay the piper, so to speak We should note here that it was not just US taxpayer dollars that
 unwittingly provided the funds to support the coup d etat in
 Ukraine In another softball interview with CNN s Zakaria,
 billionaireGeorge Soroslast May coolly admitted: I
 set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent
 of Russia And the foundation has been functioning ever since and
 played an important part in events now ù Certainly those billions of dollars weren t spent just on
 humanitarian work, like distributing pastries to the Ukrainian
 rabble gathered on Independence Square After all, the crucial
 question as to who would lend Ukraine a multi billion dollar
 rescue package was the elephant parked on Maidan that few talked
 about Once upon a time, western financial institutions had the
 market cornered on the lucrative task of bailing out
 cash strapped countries Today, however, other economic agencies
 BRICS for example are able to compete with the IMF But after
 Kiev exploded in chaos and violence, the regular lender of last
 resort bagged itself another national trophy for above its
 fireplace Michael Hudson, of Counterpunch,summed upthe IMF victory: In April
 2014, fresh from riots in Maidan Square and the February 22 coup,
 and less than a month before the May 2 massacre in Odessa, the
 IMF approved a $17 billion loan program to Ukraine s junta 
 Normal IMF practice is to lend only up to twice a country s quote
 in one year This was eight times as high Hudson said the loan,
 given at a time of civil war, proved that the Washington based
 financial institution functions as an arm of US Cold War
 politics Kiev used the loan for military expenses to attack the
 Eastern provinces, and the loan terms imposed the usual budget
 austerity, as if this would stabilize the country s
 finances For anybody who still believes those billions of dollars were
 spent just to prop up democratic institutions need only consider
 the harsh historical lessons from places as diverse and distant
 as South America and the Middle East Time and again, from Chile
 to Iran, Washington propped up puppet dictatorships to serve its
 purpose Proving this charge is as simple as eavesdropping on a telephone
 call conversation between Nuland and the US Ambassador to
 Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt Almost one year ago to the day, Nuland was heard outlining
 Washington s vision of Kiev s future democratic structure Nothing terribly ironic about that, right? While much
 of the amused media focused its attention on Nuland s F*ck
 the EU ùverbal bomb, that was mere child s play compared to
 the meat of the conversation, which spelled out exactly who
 Washington wanted in power in Kiev Nuland: I don t think Klitsch
 [Vitaly Klitschko, one of the opposition leaders] should go into
 the government I don t think it s necessary, I don t think it s
 a good idea Pyatt:Yeah I guess in terms of
 him not going into the government, just let him stay out and do

 US NATO policies in Eastern Europe which, aside from moving
 inexorably eastward to Russia s border, also excludes Russian
 participation in the US missile defense shield have in some

 blames the entire mess on Putin, while admitting to something
 incredible, yet entirely believable READ MORE: US envoy to Ukraine caught posting
 fake images on Twitter Obama told CNN s Zakaria that Washington had brokered a deal
 to transition power in Ukraine following on the heels of
 the deadly protests on Maidan and Yanukovich then
 fleeing ù[Interview segment available in above
 video] While Nuland s colorful conversation one year ago told us
 everything we needed to know about Ukraine s so called democratic
 transition, it s a completely different thing when the deal ùis admitted to by none other than the American
 president Washington power brokers, desensitized to the concept of
 brokering political deals ùdue to their so called
 democratic work in faraway war zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
 Libya, think it normal operating procedure to employ the strategy
 inside of sovereign states that are experiencing internal
 discord The real tragedy of such a scenario is not so much that it is
 happening, but that the United States, and the Ukrainian people,
 it seems, believe that a foreign invasion of political
 opportunists on their territory constitutes democracy or will
 somehow lead to democracy I d wager to bet that Ukraine will
 very soon resemble Greece, where the people had firsthand
 experience with foreign enforced austerity measures and,
 employing real democratic procedure as opposed to backroom
 brokered deals, introduced real democracy to elect politicians of
 the people, for the people and by the people But then again, the United States expected no less from the $5
 billion, and a few cakes, it paid for Kiev s pledge of
 allegiance Now the Ukrainian people must dutifully follow that

"31 Oct, 2014",‚ÄòMoscow ends up at risk with Ukraine gas agreement‚Äô,"It is not clear what Moscow gets out of a deal with Ukraine by selling gas below market price, and guaranteeing supplies to Europe while there are still sanctions and anti Russian propaganda, Paul Roberts, former Assistant US Treasury Secretary, told RT RT:How important is thisdealfor Ukraine and Europe? Paul Roberts: It is not clear what the Russian government gets
 out of it They have agreed to sell gas to Ukraine at a
 subsidized price, far below the market price And yet Ukraine
 continues to carry on propaganda against Russia, continues to
 attack the Russian population in eastern and southern Ukraine Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU Russia Ukraine gas agreement: I don t think [the IMF] had
 any choice They didn t want to get down this road But the
 alternative would have been absolutely awful: it would have
 been large parts of Europe without gas come the middle of
 winter, and that would have been utter and complete disaster RT:But getting away from those attacks how
 significant is this deal for Europe and for Ukraine, did they
 walk away winners in this? PR:Of course Europe and Ukraine walks away and
 Russia is a loser Here you have Russia subsidizing the countries
 that are imposing sanctions on it, trying to destroy Russia RT:Some experts say that Russia is a winner
 in this situation? Do you agree with that? Is this a good price
 for gas? PR:Why is a hundred dollars below the market
 price a good price? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
 Russia will ever be paid If they are not going to be paid, what
 are they going to do? They are going to cut off the gas in the
 middle of the winter so that Washington propaganda can say: Look at these evil Russians, they are starving, freezing
 Ukrainians, the gas is cut off! ùI don t think Russians
 understand what they are dealing with Washington is far more
 devious and sophisticated then Russia can comprehend This is not
 that Russia has a chance Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU Russia Ukraine gas agreement: Ukraine is broken largely
 because the EU broke it through the policies it has followed
 over the last year, and now Europe has to pay for that I don t
 think financially they are very happy about it, but
 realistically, what choice did they have ù RT:But it is not Ukraine that is going to
 pay this money to Russia The EU and IMF have said they re ready
 to finance Kiev s debt to Russia But the Ukrainian economy is in
 tatters Can they expect to get the money back? PR:If the IMF pays the Ukrainian bills it takes
 it back out of Ukraine This is not a gift to Ukraine If the
 Ukrainian economy blows up which is likely to be the case the
 IMF sees it is not going to be paid because Ukraine can t pay 
 Russians won t be paying RT:Russia is having economic problems of
 its own Is this agreement a positive step for Moscow too? PR:I think Moscow ends up at risk with this
 agreement Washington is very interested in doing all the damage
 it possibly can to Russia because Russia is a potential check on
 Washington s hegemony over the world So for all the prices
 falling is good as far as Washington is concerned I think it is
 foolish for the Russians to let their currency be traded at
 foreign exchange markets because Washington can attack the ruble
 and the exchange markets and drive it down Just as George Soros
 did One person was able to destroy the British pound Washington
 can easily destroy the ruble I still don t think Russians
 understand what they are up against; they are not really in the
 game Vladimir Putin is a good leader and he gives good speeches,
 but he doesn t seem to be able to prevent the continuing assaults
 on Russia Despite giving Ukraine a subsidized gas price, despite
 Russia guaranteeing energy supplies to Europe in the winter,
 there is no reduction in sanctions, there is no stop in the
 propaganda against Russia In fact the propaganda has increased
 because Washington is afraid that Russia might gain some
 advantage from treating Ukraine in such a kind way What is
 Russia gaining out of this? It is not getting anything Here is
 Russia with a power to turn energy off in Europe It doesn t use
 it, it doesn t say to these countries in Europe: Look, if
 you are going to put sanctions on us, if you are not going to
 have an independent foreign policy, if you are going to follow
 Washington s orders we don t sell gas to NATO members ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/201135-gas-ukraine-russia-eu-price/

 Yes, Washington s gone totally biblical, and not in a good way Meanwhile, we sit on our couches in Omaha or Orlando, reading the
 morning news served up to strike fear and loathing A thousand
 authors, conjure for you, images of Russian bears devouring
 Europe, of gleaming scimitars slicing the air, and a rerun of
 those twin towers plummeting, down, down, down But this is a
 time of WikiLeaks, the NSA spies, lies, deceit, and misdirect 
 You must see it, anyone surely must! While Caliphates, the Supreme Soviet, and Hamas rockets are
 blamed for baby killing, a crumbling western civilization is not
 brought about by Vladimir Putin, but by a decaying system of
 greed, graft, and mediocre leaders The fact is ISIS, the Arab
 Spring, and Ukraine and yes, Gaza are all components of
 Washington policy under Obama This cannot be repudiated, but it
 can be reasoned In a book entitledArabesque Americaine, Dr Ahmed Bensaada
 assembles a body of evidence that the so called Arab Spring was a
 destabilization operation, funded and orchestrated by the CIA,
 the US State Department and historically CIA funded foundations
 for so called freedom No, you c1985annot use the he s one
 of them ùexcuse, for the trail of complicity breadcrumbs
 Bensaada reveals, they lead to; the National Endowment for
 Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute for International
 Affairs (NDI), the International Republic Institute (IRI),
 Freedom House (FH), the Albert Einstein Institution (see
 reference below), the Center for Non Violent Action and
 Strategies (CANVAS), the United States Agency for International
 Development (USAID) î and George Soros opensociety Institute
 (OSI), and key actors in our American foreign policy farce Make no mistake though; we should not be deluded into believing
 that Barack Obama is some mad genius revolutionary The hierarchy
 and system behind him might be the anti Christ As proof the system ùof thought in the west it corrupted, let s look
 at Ukraine revolutionary John McCain, for a moment McCain, who we all know sits at the table of massive military
 industrialists in Arizona is also the Kiev regime s Senatorial
 superhero While some of us would like to classify his brand of
 Neo conservatism as the rambling madness of a washed up
 presidential wannabe, the mechanisms beneath the Senator bear
 witness to systematic abuses Case in point, McCain is head of an
 organization known as the International Republican Institute
 (IRI) That institution s stated goal is to; advance
 democracy worldwide ù but the how, ùthe spread,
 and the definition of democracy, these need scrutiny by us The
 good people of IRI function as researchers, pollsters, and
 analysts many times, fully integrated with the US State
 Department Recently IRI worked with the U S Middle East Partnership
 Initiative (MEPI) The point here is, in many instances where
 Arab Spring or seeming anti Arab strategy is invoked by the US,
 organizations like McCain s IRI are somehow present This quote
 from a MEPI pamphlet on Gaza is telling: MEPI also supports the International Republican Institute s
 (IRI) Public Opinion Polling and Political Leadership ù project 
 This project supports independent democratic political activists
 and promotes the utilization of public opinion research in public
 dialogue IRI and its local polling partner, the Arab World for
 Research and Development (AWRAD), provide relevant public opinion
 research to key partners, stakeholders, civilsociety 
 representatives and influential decision makers ù But still further inside American geo strategizing, the
 aforementioned Albert Einstein Institution, we can define the
 utter decay of thinking Thisreportentitled, On Strategic
 Non Violent Change, ùby one of the world s leading
 insurrection experts, Colonel Robert Helvey, shows clearly the
 blurred lines in between the state, the military, and even the
 corporations Helvey s ideas on transforming the youth of nations
 into insurrectionists are well known But his recent coming out
 over Ukraine s recent coup d √©tat, ùthis is lesser
 known Like it or not, the possibility that the American policy is dead
 wrong is with us While most of us know we love peace, the rest
 of the world is increasingly looking at all of us as trained
 killers It was Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote the quintessential
 guide for a kind of governing This guide has been in practice in
 Washington for some decades now Much has been written about
 Machiavelli s The Prince, ùbut this quote reveals the
 essence of Machiavellian intent: The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the
 world consists chiefly of the vulgar ù Niccolo Machiaveli Like it or not, we are led by people who act on this sort of
 belief Today, NATO exercises are held in Ukraine, the ceasefire
 Vladimir Putin was instrumental in attaining is already sabotaged
 by untimely anti Russia sanctions, and unmistakable aggression
 from the west Daniel McAdamsof the Ron Paul Institute for
 Peace and Prosperity calls the West s subversion of the Ukraine
 peace process by NATO a grand deception ùBut beyond
 just a very few dissenting voices, Western journalism is devoid
 of editorials for peace There simply is no anti war ùsentiment, not in the press To sum up here, you don t have to have a PhD in political science
 to understand Machiavellian intentions The Italian philosopher
 outlined how the city states of a former empire could be
 congealed on a common course again, via the machinations of a prince ùor dictator Power, as such, was outlined as
 ideology to convert and control the masses, vulgar or otherwise 
 The appearance of good, where controlling skullduggery and fear
 mongering exists, the systematic physical and psychological
 makeup of society, all these control mechanisms are leveraged on
 us today Directed at Barack Obama, for instance, the appearance
 of good was cemented in his Nobel Peace Prize The continual
 stream of Obama with little American kids, this exudes
 Machiavelli s principles, as do Obama s grand schemes for health
 care, climate change, and the cruelty of drone warfare In a
 nutshell, Obama s advisers are political scientists of the first
 order To quote from Colonel Robert Helvey s Einstein Institute piece
 again; A tyrant depends more upon the fear of sanctions to insure
 obedience than do rulers who have the willing support of the
 public ù Western leaders are putting down an enormous wager that the
 huddled masses do not understand Machiavelli London, Berlin and
 Washington do not understand though, readerships can ultimately
 reason But in studying Niccol√≤ di Bernardo dei Machiavelli
 you ll soon learn, all princes named Putin, Bush, or Obama, they
 practice the kingly game What s important for us all is the
 purpose of the underlying Machiavellianism Has America
 acquiesced toward a war for the good? Is Putin principality
 intent on preserving the good Russian people? These answers, I
 leave to you As for an American Prometheus rising, I think Mary
 Shelley s modern Prometheus is upon us We have this passage from
 Frankenstein: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would
 make peace with all I have love in me the likes of which you can
 scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not
 believe If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the
 other ù Phillip Butler

 September 14, signaled the return of a left leaning government
 after eight years in opposition The change of government in
 Sweden also means an end of the mandate of one of the well known
 lawmakers in the European political arena Foreign Minister Carl
 Bildt Bildt has been a fierce critic of Russia over its politics
 in Ukraine RT:Bildt was one of the people behind the
 Eastern partnership the initiative governing the EU s relations
 with post soviet states Some argue, this policy is partly to
 blame for the current chaos in Ukraine, would you agree? Bryan MacDonald:It definitely played a large
 part, but it wouldn t exclusively have led to this of course 
 There are other factors such as Ukrainian internal politics,
 movements and of course interference of the US, NATO and
 non government bodies such as George Soros and Pierre Omidyar 
 But certainly the Eastern Partnership is one of the bulwarks, and
 of course Carl Bildt was one of the main supporters of it A
 partnership that has completely transformed the EU from a core
 group of 15 relatively rich West European countries to a group of
 27 where most of the group are poor RT:He served on the Board of Directors of
 Lundin Oil, during the Civil war in Sudan The company was
 accused of providing resources to government forces that
 committed crimes against humanity How did that affect his
 reputation in Sweden? BM:I don t think people in Europe are really
 aware of that I think Bildt in Europe was mainly famous for his
 behavior in the Balkans and Ukraine this year, and his general
 support of what we call eurocratic ùpolitics, which is
 where the elite within Europe, every country almost, with a few
 exceptions of course, seem to care more about the European
 project then the actual people who live in Europe at the moment 
 That is one of the reasons he has been in the news here, I don t
 think Sudan is such a big issue in Europe itself amongst the
 normal voting public RT:Bildt worked with the Committee for the
 liberation of Iraq pushing for the invasion of the country How
 big of a role did the organization play in the conflict? BM:Again, like with the Ukraine situation, it s
 one of many groups that played a role in conflict Obviously the
 biggest role in the conflict was played by George Bush and Tony
 Blair by their bombing of Iraq Of course it played a role and
 Bildt is a notorious neo con, but the real question here is that
 Bildt is a slavish supporter of what we call American values
 which are not necessarily in train with what we call European
 values Most Europeans, not all, but especially countries like
 France, in the Nordic countries and Ireland, would be suspicious
 of America s actions and would have a very different world view
 to the US Bildt is not; Bildt is for whatever reason, maybe his
 personal self benefit or general ideology, 100 percent supports
 American policies without almost any question ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/188136-bildt-sweden-eastern-partnership/
"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to ‚Äòvoluntarily commit suicide‚Äô,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT s Truthseeker RT:Could you
 summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
 IMF loans, to Ukraine s best assets ending up in private Western
 hands the IMF s knee breaker role as you memorably described
 it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
 mind is that finance today is war by non military means The aim
 of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
 ending up with its property The main property to obtain is that
 which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange For
 Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
 companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
 oligarchs For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
 these assets and their revenue into foreign hands in an economy
 whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
 of the failed post 1991 restructuring That is where the IMF
 comes in The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
 deficits Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
 mainly to maintain a country s exchange rate The effect usually
 is to subsidize flight capital out of the country at a high
 exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
 dollars or euro In Ukraine s case, foreign creditors would
 include Gazprom, which already has been paid something The IMF
 transfers a credit to its Ukraine account, ùwhich then
 pays foreign creditors The money never really gets to Ukraine or
 to other IMF borrowers It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
 including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
 Greece Such loans come with conditionalities ùthat
 impose austerity This in turn drives the economy even further
 into debt forcing the government to tighten the budget even
 more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
 assets RT:Can Ukraine expect the so called IMF
 effect of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
 to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
 to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants 
 remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP (About $10 billion a
 year ) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
 Western Europe The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
 more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work They will send
 some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
 Ukrainian currency vis √† vis the ruble and euro RT:How are the IMF s tools in reality
 weapons of mass destruction ù as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
 austerity and unemployment The result is a downward economic
 spiral Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues So governments are
 told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets 
 mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
 extract economic rent The effect is to turn the economy into a
 renting tollbooth economy ùHitherto free public roads
 are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
 sewer systems also are privatized This raises the cost of
 living, and hence the cost of labor while overall wage levels
 are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
 raises unemployment RT:The IMF s perhaps also a weapon of mass
 destruction in a more literal sense The organization has
 publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
 re design its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
 Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting 
 Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
 instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF s conditionality ùis that
 it pacify ùthe East Pacification may occur violently
 in today s Orwellian rhetoric The only way in which actual
 political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
 federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
 kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
 the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
 prosecuted the IMF All that voters can do is reject governments
 submitting to IMF conditionalities Many voters who are able will vote with their feet ùand simply leave the sinking
 economy So the IMF s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
 are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered 
 Austerity is ultimately a policy nobody is holding gun to their
 head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
 in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it In this
 sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago RT:Everyone knows austerity s effects on
 Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don t want it;
 even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn t work Why will
 Ukraine s leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
 job in the West when they ve voted out or something? MH:Ukraine s leaders are mainly kleptocrats 
 Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
 their own power George Soros has written that their best way to
 do this is to find Western partners This will provide US and
 European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
 economy Western support will provide more IMF and European
 lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
 can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
 banks RT:Do you think that the EU isn t stupid
 enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one sided
 association agreement, member states will just strip the country
 of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
 Ukraine s 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
 member One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
 German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Ukraine has rich Western land,
 and that part of the country is largely still rural Foreign
 investors would like to buy it out and re feudalize ùit, creating large business farms But the EU is unlikely to
 provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
 investment in Western European agriculture The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
 benefit from its inexpensive labor Wrecking the economy
 Greek style or Irish style or Latvian style is sufficient to send
 its workers to the West And the most mobile traditionally are
 the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
 languages and with skills in demand in the West RT:You noted Ukraine must have asked the
 US first before blowing up that gas pipeline Do you think NATO
 will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
 less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
 waging a big PR campaign in Europe MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
 economy much more high cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
 in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange The NATO
 rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
 Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine won t continue
 subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
 Russia can arm itself against us [with this money] ù The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
 manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
 defend itself And without purchasing foreign technology and
 without large state subsidy as US and European governments
 provide their own economies Russia cannot create a
 manufacturing economy So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
 earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
 that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
 military power my potentially be used to achieve political
 independence from the US sphere RT:Anything else you would like to
 add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
 throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
 power of elected governments, and hence of democracy Governments
 are sovereign No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
 or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
 state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
 war At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
 financial oligarchy, or elected governments The two sets of aims
 are antithetical: rising living standards and national
 independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international
 dependency The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/170960-economy-imf-ukraine-oligarchs/

 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ] The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia This has been the colorrevolution s that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments It s not something that comes as a surprise to me SS:You ve mentioned Georgia and orangerevolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s SS:You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another prot√©g√© of that whole Shachtmanite issues You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations SS:But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years SS:The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the orangerevolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent ù SR:I absolutely agree The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned ù or gotten out of control ù it s a fine line There are individuals who are very well trained These NGOs operate on every level They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier because the patrols are less likely it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia Herzegovina is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the europeanunion has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time SS:With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? ù What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing SS:If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp of ¶ and there s a lot of money that comes with that There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders it comes with the good price tag SS:So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your money ¶NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative SS:If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either Let s say that NATO does want to come in they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies ¶because NATO won t come in as a state, run only ¶you know, europeanunion will have to come alongside it So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it I think the Western economy is poison SS:You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that ¶ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic That s the problem that I have with this You talk about hegemony the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance SS:What about these sanctions that the U S and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success They would slow down the amount of success that they are having The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the europeanunion , and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia ¶you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time SS:But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany ¶ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise SS: ¶It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, ù how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the europeanunion I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine SS:If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"27 Feb, 2014",‚ÄòWest plays with fire to drive the Russian naval base out of Crimea‚Äô,"Crimea s ethnic composition and Western policy towards Ukraine could create a Kosovo like scenario where the majority of Russian speaking residents would claim independence which could lead to violence on the ground, Oxford historian Mark Almond told RT RT:If the EU and the US are concerned about
 doing what people on the Maidan want, why are they ignoring what
 people in Crimea want? Mark Almond:Well one would have thought so if
 you re going to listen to the crowd on the street on the square
 and there are many squares where there re crowds including
 Simferopol and Sevastopol The basic problem of course is what
 the Americans, particularly the lead military power in NATO want,
 is to eventually ease the Russian navy out of its base, out of
 its lease in Sevastopol in the Crimea And so of course the fact
 that the great majority of people in Crimea not only 60 per cent
 that are actually Russian but many of the rest who speak Russian
 as their everyday language is something that the EU and NATO
 countries want to ignore Of course if you have any kind of push
 to create a crisis, I m afraid our democratic basis as in Kosovo
 where the great majority, where the great majority of Albanians
 wanted to be independent from Serbia, you would create a Kosovo
 crisis in Crimea But of course strangely enough Washington and
 Brussels suddenly aren t terribly interested in this I myself
 think that creating a crisis is not a good idea, but nonetheless
 they seem to be bent on pushing to increase tension between
 people on the Peninsula And of course there is a risk of
 violence against either ethnic Russians, civilians that are there
 or against the sailors and soldiers on the base RT:The Crimean Tatars have long been
 calling for the establishment of their own autonomy, why are they
 now siding with the pro EU crowds in Kiev? MA:I think this is a very incoherent position 
 The Tatars historically are seen as the traditional native
 inhabitants of the Crimea Catherine the Great s Russia took over
 250 years ago and then of course Khrushchev, the communist
 dictator gave Crimea to Ukraine only 60 years ago The Tatars
 feel that they have been neglected and eventually many of them
 who have been forced out of their territory have come back But I
 think it is a great mistake to think that they are the supporters
 of the Ukrainian nationalism My experience in the Crimea is that
 most Tatars speak Russian as their everyday language and of
 course they do learn Tatar as well And they don t have any great
 sympathy for Ukrainian nationalism and now of course the
 transitional government in Kiev has abolished the language
 rights, not only Russian but of Tatars and Hungarians in the
 West So again we have this paradox The EU is a great believer
 of minority rights, except when these minorities aren t fully
 paid up supporters of its crowd on the streets of central Kiev 
 And I think again many Tatars in fact walked to the
 demonstration, I don t think that we should overate the fact that
 a group of people, many of them have been beneficiaries of George
 Soros s language schools and scholarships We should not be
 overrating how many of the many thousands of Tatars who live in
 Crimea necessarily want trouble I think this is an exaggeration RT:At the start of the rally in Crimea, we
 saw the Tatars vastly outnumbering the ethnic Russian crowd Does
 that reflect the real numbers among these ethnic groups
 there? MA:No, of course what we see, actually what we
 saw on Maidan Square in Kiev, strangely enough the spontaneous
 demonstrations of pro westerners is much better organized, funded
 when you bring in Brussels and lorry loads of people But of
 course once this crowd assembled, I m afraid it drew out the
 majority of the local population who are Russians, and this is
 very dangerous It seems to me that the Americans and the people
 in the Soros foundation who support these local nationalist
 groups are playing with fire Because if you begin to send out a
 relatively small crowd of people to ban things that frighten the
 majority of people in the first place It is very dangerous just
 like it would be if suddenly a lot of Russians appeared in Lvov,
 in Western Ukraine and started saying Shouldn t we all be part
 of Russia ù It would be very provocative and very dangerous But
 it seems to me that the West is not totally concerned about this
 danger and that I think could lead to another Crimean War
 exploding in our faces 160 years after the last one RT:How did these ethnic groups end up in
 Crimea anyway? MA:As I ve said about 250 years ago, Crimea was
 ruled by the Muslim Tatar Khans who were subjects of the Ottoman
 Empire Catherine the Great of Russia conquered what we now call
 the Ukraine and the Crimea Then with the WWI, the Russian
 Revolution tool place and the anti communists were driven out of
 Crimea and most of Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union When
 Hitler came in 1941, he eventually captured Sevastopol in Crimea 
 But when the Nazis were forced to withdraw, Stalin took the view
 that the ethnic Tatars were being anti Russian, anti Soviet have
 collaborated with the Nazis I think this is a travesty of the
 behavior of most those Tatars, although ironically now we have
 Germans newspapers saying, how wonderful the Tatars are to be
 collaborating with the united Europe Leave that aside, huge
 numbers of Tatars were deported to Central Asia Eventually in
 the Gorbachev period 30 years ago they were allowed to return, to
 come back to the Crimea Sadly in the meantime all sorts of other
 people, who lived there themselves of course, could be Russians
 for generations, or people who in the Soviet period have moved
 in, are living where they re used to live So the tragedy for many of the Tatars is that they have left
 where they have grown up in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, come back
 to the Crimea and find nowhere to live, live in poverty and I m
 afraid to say some of whom may be agitatedbecause of the living
 rate poverty People also in the Western Ukraine do when somebody
 comes and says, you could have a career, here is a little bit of
 money to set up an activist NGO group and so on who would not
 take it if you are destitute And that I think is the danger We
 have in fact an under employed population who can be agitated RT:So what do you think will happen next in
 Crimea? MA:Well Crimea which is such a beautiful place
 should be the center of interaction between the Russian cultures,
 Chekov lived there, of Tatar culture and the playground on the
 seashore The danger is if you allow people to be obsessed that
 one nation has to dominate, and in this case a very small number
 of Ukrainians who live in Crimea are being used by the great
 majority of the Ukrainians who live outside the Peninsula and by
 the West because it wants to get rid of the Russian naval base,
 to be a battering ram And I think this is very dangerous 
 Ideally Crimea would be a sunny playground for everybody to
 enjoy Sadly, I think people from a long way away are prepared to
 play with fire to drive the naval base out But if we remember
 what happened in 1850s, we can discover that the Crimean conflict
 can turn out to drag in other people ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-crimea-west-policy-942/

 W , who then went on to joke about the whole affair during a
 White House dinner in March 2004 Clearly, blatant genocide and war crimes committed by the West s
 top leaders in broad daylight over which nobody seems to be
 responsible No one was ever made accountable; no one ever
 bothered to apologize to Iraq or to the world I guess they ve all been too busy going after and smokin out 
 other rogue states like Syria, where the civil war against the
 legal government of Bashar Assad that is being waged by US, UK,
 French, Saudi and Israeli backed/trained/financed terrorists
 (including Al Qaeda offshoot Al Nusra Front) has already cost
 over 120,000 Syrian deaths, mostly civilian Then there was Libya in 2011, where interim democratic 
 government estimates speak of as many as 30,000 dead, including
 the execution of Muammar Gaddafi and many of his family members
 and government officials God only knows how many were actually
 shot, bombed, and lynched like Gaddafi by the NATO backed
 freedom fighters there Add to this the impossible to calculate number of dead, maimed
 and murdered during the Western Powers engineered Arab
 Spring throughout the Arab World over the past three years,
 plus the decades long Palestinian tragedy at the hands of their
 Israeli run Concentration Camp Kommandants, and we re talking
 about many millions of deaths which begin to echo the so, so
 oft repeated 6 million figure So be careful, world! † Make sure your country s not branded
 a rogue state , because if it is, then you re in for a
 lot of trouble! First of all, the term more importantly, the concept was made
 popular during the Clinton Administration It was formally
 introduced by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in 1994 when
 then National Security Advisor Anthony Lake published a report in
 CFR journal Foreign Affairs, claiming the reality of
 recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain
 outside the family [of democratic nations] but also assault its
 basic values ù In typical self righteous US ranting, he then went on to label
 North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Iran as rogue states That
 initial list grew with time to include Sudan, Afghanistan,
 Somalia, Serbia, Montenegro, Venezuela all backed by PsyWar
 name calling like Axis of Evil , Outposts of
 Tyranny and Terrorist States But, to understand what a rogue state is, we first need to
 understand what a rogue state is not in today s world according
 to the US/UK/EU/Israel Let s begin by describing the four things that every country must
 do in order not to be branded a rogue state by the global
 hegemons: 1) General behavior: Every nation must maintain unconditional and
 unflinching alignment to the present world order controlled and promoted by the global powers that are embedded
 deep inside key Western military powers, notably the US If a nation heeds, obeys, acclaims, pays tribute and is
 subservient to the on going economic, financial, political,
 historical and cultural world outlook and order, and remains
 passive whilst the global powers prepare the coming new world
 order whether under the guise of the Western
 democracies , or globalization , or the
 international community or, soon to come, World
 Government then you re OK If, however, a nation dares defy any aspect of this, it will soon
 find itself slipping fast into rogue state mode That s
 what happened to Saddam in 1990 after he invaded Kuwait without
 first getting the proper green light from the US; that s
 what happened to Argentina s pro US military junta in 1982 when
 General Galtieri tried to take back the Falkland Islands from
 Britain without Washington s OK 2) Specific behavior: Then, every nation must maintain
 unconditional alignment to specific US/UK/EU/Israel dictated special interests involving the country and its region 
 This naturally varies from country to country and fluctuates as
 specific interests of the hegemon evolve † Some examples: ¢ Egypt: Total alignment to Israel and its geopolitical
 interests That was quite a historical somersault for Gamal
 Nasser s country to make, considering that for decades Egypt
 spearheaded Arab opposition to the West s imposing of Israel on
 Palestinian territory Hosni Mubarak was their man who for 32
 years kept Egypt on course until † Until he
 stupidly breached condition No 3 (see below) ¢ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain:
 Keep the oil flowing, be nice to our oil companies and to Israel,
 and your leaders can do whatever else they like (see 4, below) ¢ Argentina: Never, ever launch a proper investigation into the
 country s decades old mostly illegitimate even illegal public
 debt rooted in the 1976 1983 US backed military regime Because if Argentina were to do that it could then declare huge
 chunks of it as odious debt suing the mega bankers in
 US/EU courts Such table turning would make Goldman Sachs,
 Citigroup, JPMorganChase, HSBC, the IMF/WorldBank/FED and vulture
 funds really angry One other thing: now that your 30 year old
 democracy has destroyed Argentina s armed forces and sunk the
 country into unprecedented decadence, don t even think of making
 a policy U turn Keep all of this going and your leaders too can
 do whatever else they like (see 4, below) 3) Internal control & credibility: However, if a nation s
 leadership behaves nicely , yet cannot control its own
 population and maintain domestic credibility, then like it or
 not, we re going to have to replace you † And if you don t
 like it, well, they will just make you an offer you can t a Hosni Mubarak of Egypt: When the Tahrir Square uprising began
 he proved unable to maintain order and credibility It turned out
 that 32 years is just too long stay in power even with US money
 and support, so out the window he went When Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton visited Egypt in March 2011 to make sure
 Egypt gets the kind of democracy that we want to see, ùMuslim
 Brotherhood president Morsi was not what she had in mind, so he
 too went out the window thanks to a US backed military coup Aren t military coups supposed to be done by undemocratic
 SOB s? † Yes, but as President Franklin Roosevelt once
 famously said of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, he may
 be an SOB, but he s our SOB! ù b Fernando de La R√∫a of Argentina: Elected in 1999, he was 110
 percent compliant with (1) and (2) above, however he was most
 inept in the way he bled the country so it would pay its pound of
 flesh to international mega bankers His internal credibility and
 grip collapsed and Fernando was forced to escape aboard his
 chopper from the roof of the Casa Rosada presidential palace into
 oblivion, as his police killed and beat up protesters on the
 Plaza de Mayo square below Twelve years on, with Argentina s democracy about to
 celebrate its 30th anniversary, its present political managers
 are again losing grip: a new bout of spares and replacements 
 are thus needed, and you can bet your bottom dollar that they
 have been identified and are being positioned to become
 Argentina s soon to come new government Just make sure
 that they too continue being serial debt payers to the
 global mega bankers as president Cristina Kirchner recently
 described her and her husband s more than 10 year tenure in
 power 4) Corruption galore: The global powers message to all national
 political leaders: as long as you fully perform and comply with
 (1), (2) and (3) above, you can sink your grubby hands into all
 the money you want The message is clear: perform as we need you
 to perform on the above key issues, and we don t really care if
 you steal millions, hundreds of millions or even billions from
 your own people, whether by imposing endemic poverty on the local
 population or as outright theft CitiCorp, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros, Goldman Sachs, US
 Treasury, the IMF & World Bank couldn t care less if Mubarak,
 Berlusconi, Rajoy, Fujimori, Menem, Calder√≥n, Lula and Kirchner
 steal from their own people If they can get away with it whilst
 maintaining their local credibility and grip, it s just not an
 issue If anything it s an added asset for the elite, because
 should such local leaders misbehave , they can then be
 easily blackmailed out of power That, in a nutshell, is how the global powers exert control over
 whole countries and regions by ensuring their chosen local
 managers are placed at the helm of national governments to do
 the elites dirty work for them As long as these leaders behave
 and perform properly they can stay on for decades just like
 Hosni Mubarak If they misbehave or their useful lives expire, they re
 then quickly shown the exit and shoved out the door When their
 crimes and thefts are publicly exposed their own local
 populations will do the kicking out for them Saddam was so useful during the eight year war of attrition
 against Iran in the 80s (Iran was Ronald Reagan s original rogue
 state), even Don Rumsfeld shook Saddam s hand and gave him
 chemical WMD s to use against Iran s Ayatollahs After Kuwait,
 however, Ronnie s Veep the Elder Bush gave Saddam quite a
 thrashing, but he didn t learn his lesson So Baby Bush taught
 him good in 2003 Sure, it s not all that simple: each country has its own
 characteristics, its own problems, its own usefulness for the
 global powers In fact, each country is a testing ground and a
 learning ground, the lessons of which are later put to good use
 in other countries and regions So, nations of the world: you ve been warned When walking
 amongst fierce beasts, make sure you do so quietly, cautiously
 and discreetly Be not too defiant lest you too are branded a rogue state Then
 you ll be in real trouble! Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their
associated think tanks in being effective representatives of their
constituencies ùIRI is chaired by conservative Senator John
McCain, known for his extremely aggressive position in favor of
Israel and US conflicts overseas, while other leading figures have
held senior foreign policy positions in the Reagan and Bush
administrations IRI works in countries important to U S 
interests, where we can make a difference IRI focuses on three
tasks: helping political parties broaden their appeal, ensuring
that they rule justly once elected and aiding civilsociety in
guaranteeing good governance IRI can help catalyze the efforts of
democratic activists in a country so long as they want change
more than we want it for them, ùwrites IRI s president, Lorne
Craner, who previously held a position in the US State
Department The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also
receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the opensociety 
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
"19 Mar, 2013",King of the past reaching for Malaysia oil reserves,"Malaysia, boasting the third largest oil reserves in the Asia Pacific region, finds itself on the verge of a military fight over its richest region Malaysia has been in the midst of an ongoing security crisis
since early February, when a group of 235 rag tag militiamen from
the neighboring southern Philippines slipped into the eastern state
of Sabah and began occupying several villages While engaging
police in multiple firefights, the insurgents beheaded and
mutilated several captured Malaysian security personnel, prompting
Malaysian forces to deploy fighter jets in an unprecedented air
assault over the area in an operation to flush out the intruders 
The gunmen call themselves the Royal Army of the Sulu Sultanate, 
representing the heirs of a long defunct kingdom which once
controlled the territory up until the late nineteenth century The
so called Sultan of Sulu, Jamalul Kiram III, who is believed to be
directing the militant incursion from Manila, insists that Sabah is
rightfully part of his kingdom and has vowed not budge on his
claims even if his personnel are killed in the standoff Malaysians, who are preparing to vote in a pivotal general
election just around the corner, have been fixated on events in
Sabah as they unfold The Philippines are soon expecting
congressional elections as well, and given the timing, local
analysts are wondering how exactly did this elderly self proclaimed
Sultan obtain the resources needed to establish his own private
army Both the Malaysian and Philippine governments have launched
official investigations into allegations that figures within
Malaysia s political opposition had a hand in aiding the Sulu
gunmen Reuters cited an anonymous Filipino military officer who
claimed that Sulu rebels were invited to Sabah by a Malaysian
opposition politician The blame has been laid on Malaysia s de facto opposition
leader, Anwar Ibrahim, who Malaysian reports say has links to
Filipino insurgent networks that have long eyed the resource rich
state of Sabah in northern eastern Borneo Local journalist Adrian
Lai recently unearthed classified diplomatic cables from the US
embassy in Manila brought to light by WikiLeaks, which document
ties between Nur Misauri, former chairmen of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), and Malaysia s main opposition leader
Anwar Ibrahim The MNLF is a political movement that pitted itself
against predominately Christian Manila by seeking political
autonomy for Muslim majority provinces in the islands in the
southern Philippines In 2001, Manila accused Misauri of terrorism
when he led an MNLF unit that attacked an outpost of the Philippine
army, prompting him to seek refuge in Sabah on the assumption that
authorities in Muslim majority Malaysia would empathize with him
and block his extradition Misauri was detained by Malaysian
security forces in Sabah and sent back to the Philippines where he
was jailed until 2008 WikiLeaks cables claim that Misauri detested the Malaysian
government for turning him over to Philippine authorities and that
he was a strong advocate for the recovery of Sabah The cables
claim that Misauri boasted that his militias could invade Sabah in
the span of two hours WikiLeaks has also confirmed that Misauri
maintained close connections to Anwar Ibrahim, and that the two had
met on several occasions A separate report issued by AFP cited US
diplomatic cables that implicate a Saudi Arabian ambassador to the
Philippines of funding Muslim groups seeking autonomy in the
southern islands Misauri recently criticized Philippine President
Benigno Aquino for siding with Malaysia in his firm stance against
the Sulu militants, warning the Aquino government of chaos if Sulu
Sultan Jamalul Kiram III is apprehended Anwar Ibrahim, who has vehemently denied all accusations, has
long been considered a darling of the West Mr Ibrahim is a
slippery character of sorts; he was once Malaysia s deputy prime
minister prior to being sacked for getting too close to the IMF,
among other things Anwar also has friends in high places, from
billionaire financier George Soros to senior neo cons from the Bush
administration In recent times, Ibrahim has appealed to Carl
Gershman, president of the US Government funded foundation, the
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), requesting that he send a
US observer team to Malaysia to monitor the upcoming elections 
Ibrahim enraged many when he stated he would support policy to
protect the security of Israel, and while his political party has
long received training and backing from the International
Republican Institute (IRI) chaired by Republican Senator John
McCain, there little doubt that Anwar a creature of Washington s
taxpayer funded Democracy Promotion ù overseas would be the
trusted ally that the White House is looking for as it refocuses
its military muscle and political influence to the Asia Pacific
region Philippine President Benigno Aquino has recently conceded that
events in Sabah showed signs of a conspiracy A recent statement
issued by Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar
alludes to reports of Malaysian opposition figures promising land,
titles and other sinecures to the Sulu Sultanate if they emerged
victorious in the upcoming elections Muzaffar argues that a
security crisis in Sabah, regarded as a political stronghold for
the Barisan Nasional (BN) government, could weaken the ruling
parties hold over the state, leading to a hung parliament or a
narrow victory for the BN, prompting in his words, massive
street agitation which could pave the way for a regime change,
which is the goal of not only the Opposition but also its foreign
backers ù When Chandra talks of foreign backers, he is
referring to the US political establishment The MNLF, under its current chairmen Muslimin Sema, has issued
statements declaring that it disagreed with the incursion into
Sabah, but acknowledged that MNLF forces aligned to Misauri were
present there Reports issued by Reuters also cited Malaysian
officials who claimed that the Sulu terrorists had links to
factions that were unhappy with the Philippines recent peace
agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an
Islamist MNLF offshoot The Malaysian government facilitated these
peace talks, and Misauri made no secret that he publically opposed
them The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that some ten thousand
MNLF fighters from the southern Philippines planned to join the
insurgency in Sabah in solidarity with the Royal Sulu Army Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III has told media in the Philippines
that he wants the United Nations, the United States and the United
Kingdom to intervene in his claim over Sabah The Sultan claims
that the US must intercede, as agreed upon in a 1915 agreement
signed with Washington s then colonial government in the
Philippines that mandated the US provide full protection ù to the
Sulu Sultan in exchange for exercising sovereignty over the kingdom
as the colonial administration Let s not forget, the strategically
located state of Sabah is abundant in natural gas reserves, and its
oil reserves are the third highest in the Asia Pacific region after
China and India Sabah s fifteen oil wells produce as many as
192,000 barrels a day, while the country has holds over 4 billion
barrels of proven oil reserves In 2010, Malaysia was the world s
third largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar
and Indonesia The Malaysian government had paid a modest annual
cession payment to the Sultanate (which the Sultan argues is a
 rent ù) since gaining independence from Britain, and one of the
motivations for the Sultan s push to reclaim the territory is
definitely profit driven While the Pentagon refocuses over 60% of
its naval presence to the Asia Pacific region, conflicts of this
nature which deal with obstructions to the flow of abundant
energy resources to US companies are exactly the sort that could
coax the eventual involvement of US personnel if Sabah were to
deteriorate into a hotbed of Sulu terror The fact that individuals in the highest levels of the Malaysian
and Philippine governments are suspicious of a conspiracy does much
to lend credence to the possibility Former Malaysian PM Dr 
Mahathir Mohammad, an ardent critic of Israel and US imperialism,
warned months prior to the standoff in Sabah that the opposition s
Western backers sought to bring Anwar Ibrahim to power through Arab
Spring style street riots and even the use of fire power He cited
recent examples in Egypt and Syria where NATO states backed
political opposition figures and supported al Qaeda linked rebels
to act on their behalf in overthrowing governments they were tired
of Reports of Saudi Arabia financially supporting Philippine
terrorists should also not be taken lightly, as Gulf States have
moved in step with the US and NATO as the main financiers of
Salafist terrorist networks active in west Asia, north Africa and
elsewhere Without resorting to elaborate conspiracies in the absence of
hard facts, it would be entirely negligent to ignore circumstantial
evidence linking Malaysian figures to this insurgency, especially
considering all sources of this nature are non Malaysian in origin 
There is no doubt that the Sultan has no legitimate legal claims
over Sabah since the International Court of Justice has long
recognized Malaysia s rights and sovereignty over the territory,
and the highly unusual timing of the Sulu operation being so close
to elections in both countries will naturally be perceived as
suspect Militancy and terrorism undermines the Sultan s claims
entirely and lends much credibility to suspicion that the Sultan
has not acted alone Even if the US isn t involved, the fact that a
figure who received blatant US support has been implicated is
significant There is much at stake in Sabah, and in the words of
the Sultan, The only thing that could end the conflict is an

"9 Jul, 2012",Washington‚Äôs new tricks on the road to global dominance (Op-Ed),"The latest round of the war against an independent Syria unfolded in Paris last week at the gathering of the Friends of Syria ù Russia and China very rightly did not attend this amoral ù in the diplomatic language of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting At the meeting western champions of the war insisted on their interpretation of the one week old Geneva agreements: transition government based on mutual consent ù means Bashar al Assad must go ù, affirmed French President Hollande This recent round of pressure highlights two new tactics employed by Washington: word games and an end run around the United Nations itself First, the new formula transition government ù The authoritative Merriam Webster dictionary defines regime ù as government ù and change ù as transition ù Thus, for those who reject regime change, ù a euphemism was created that has much better chances to go through Interestingly enough, this term was promoted by an expert of Russian origin, Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center On June 28, 2012 Trenin published a suggestion in his piece Syria: A Russian Perspective ù: Russia might be willing to cooperate with the U S and other countries if the goal moves towards transition ù rather than regime change ù † what has been dubbed the Yemen model ùSo who is Mr Trenin? This retired Soviet colonel was a Senior Research Fellow at the NATO Defense College in Rome just before he was recruited in 1993 to join the Carnegie Moscow Center, created the same year by none other than Michael McFaul, the current US Ambassador in Moscow After nearly 20 years in the pay of the Americans Trenin was rewarded with his current post as director by his former boss, Rose Gottemoeller, who left Moscow in 2008 to join the State Department where she is now Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Big shoes to fill for Mr Trenin, but in Washington they know how to pick their cadre The board of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington features this world is truly small Kofi Annan himself Among the Endowments Funders and Supporters ù are George Soros s opensociety Institute, the US National Intelligence Council, the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Defense Department, and a collection of other private and public enthusiasts Of course the transition government ù and Yemen model ù are nothing other than regime change ù Honestly: we, Russians, brought up on Tolstoy and Chekhov, should be able to miss Washington s elementary school semantic traps Secondly, unable to push anti Syrian resolutions through the UN Security Council due to Russia and China s staunch resistance, Washington is building up a group of more than hundred nations more pliable to US pressure Such coalitions of the willing ù have been put together before, but this time the number of countries makes it look like a parallel anti UN construct acting as if it is replacing the UN General Assembly itself Such a gathering, despite total absence of legitimacy, is not just a talking platform French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told Le Parisien ù that the Paris meeting would push for a Chapter VII United Nations resolution to enforce the transition plan A Chapter VII resolution can authorize the use of military force to maintain or restore international peace and security In the short term, the United States may attempt to institutionalize this ad hoc grouping into a mechanism to implement a final solution ù to President Al Assad In the long term, Washington may try to solidify such structure into an anti U N body of sycophants, ready and willing to approve any U S initiative Now, from tactics to strategy Looking at the type of leaders that are seizing power in the Arab world with American assistance, a normal person is perplexed: why does the United States, with assistance of their local satellites, keep on removing moderate secular governments and bringing to power, in one country after another, increasingly radical extremists that same type of people who committed 9/11, the greatest tragedy in U S post WWII history?Indeed, this question is not solvable by listening to Washington s official line of arguments But take a look at the policies of the US and its European partners during the in the 1930s Then, America and its ever so reasonable and civilized European allies provided the financial, industrial and political support encouraging the highly energized, violent extremist Nazi and fascist movements in Europe With a purpose: to direct its violence against Russia According to the plan, Germany and Russia were to exhaust themselves so that the US would emerge dominant Similarly, the earlier use of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and again today the encouragement of various Muslim extremists including elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are part of the plan to create a regional movement which could be thrown against Iran, Russia and China Such a furnace of war and chaos in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia will permanently disable all three of America s strategic rivals and allow Washington to rise to uncontested world domination †We should be able to decipher not only US language, but also US strategy In the 1930s, the Soviet Union was at the front line of the fight against Fascism in Europe Today, Russia owes it to its history and to the fallen in the anti fascist struggle to recognize and before it is too late avert American designs We must prevent Russian and other people from being drawn into a bloodbath of mutual extermination in the voracious interest of Washington s drive for global hegemony Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-syria-transition-721/
"26 Jun, 2012",Latin America: Is ‚ÄúArab Spring‚Äù coming to town? (Op-Ed),"A wave of protests have rolled across Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia countries taking a strong stance against the US and its allies policies in the region Are we witnessing a Latin American Spring ù? Whilst engineering violent insurgency does not yet seem to be on the † agenda of the Global Power Masters, there are indications of growing PsyWar activity by pro democracy ù, pro human rights ù, aid ù agencies and NGO s acting through local players aligned to US/UK/EU interests Lighting the match Is this paving the way for far worse things to come? Those who light the match ù that fires popular protests and unrest have learned only too well from their Arab Spring ù experience how to fan those flames into catastrophic social wildfires Some alarm bells are beginning to go off in countries like Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, whose presidents † Hugo Chavez, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales, respectively † are not playing to the tune played by the US and its allies, who for over a century have exerted economic colonial domination over Latin America Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador insist in maintaining close relations with countries the US and its allies have branded as rogue states ù, notably, Iran, Syria and, until Muammar Gaddafi s public murder, Libya † Have they been thus earmarked to become beachheads for a coming Latin American Spring ù of engineered insurrection?The so called Arab Spring ù too began by fanning the flames of a wide assortment of popular grievances that grew into mass demonstrations that quickly escalated into uncontrolled social violence on all sides A sign that this kind of match ù is being lit can be seen in Ecuador where Quito newspaper El Tel√©grafo ù revealed that a so called Active Citizenry Project ù to train opposition journalists ù is getting 4 3 million dollars in funds from USAID the United States Agency for International Development, who also funnel funds to local opposition groups like Faro and Fundamedios with the declared excuse of strengthening democracy ù through workshops, forums, and media surveillance projects Webs of power To understand how this complex domination system really works, we also need to look at private sector activity, which is instrumental in achieving control over countries in the region For example, a private entity like the Rockefeller led Americas Society ù strongly linked to the Council on Foreign Relations lying just across the street from them on New York City s plush Park Avenue was recently able to catapult one if its members, Juan Manuel Santos, to become president of Colombia, a traditional US ally in the region Other Americas Society members include powerful regional and global business and political leaders, like World Jewish Congress chairman Eduardo Elsztain (George Soros Argentine business partner) and Gustavo and Patricia Cisneros owners of a powerful Venezuelan opposition multi media conglomerate Co chairing the America s Society with David Rockefeller is John Negroponte, who served as George W Bush s ambassador to the UN and Iraq, and was also his National Security Advisor † Often, it is little known facts like these that help join the dots ù to get the real picture of where power lies, but which the Western mainstream media all but ignore Just as they ignored the fact that the Global Power Masters imposed Mario Monti as president of troubled Italy who also happens ù to be European Chairman for the Rockefeller Rothschild Trilateral Commission with its large mega banker membership Thankfully, the world is waking up to the fact that the so called Arab Spring ù is nothing more than a vehicle to impose Western style democracy ù throughout the Muslim world, thereby weakening all sovereign states Clearly, this is being engineered, financed and abetted by the Power Elite s shrewdly taking advantage of internal divisions and hijacking genuine grievances of local populations to their advantage They use all the weapons at their disposal † often through CIA, MI6 and Mossad operatives † This includes global and local media PsyWar that spreads false/distorted information about what s really happening in each country and why Seven Step Guide to country destruction Writing in RT last year on the Arab Spring ù, we described a Seven Step process whereby the Western Powers can escalate turmoil into outright destruction † Since clouds are gathering over Latin America and other regions, we would do well to review this process:1 They begin by targeting a country ripe for regime change ù, often branding it a Rogue State ù; then 2 They spread flagrant lies through their news media and paid journalists and call it the International Community s Concern ù, then 3 They finance and promote internal turmoil and strife, often escalating it to arming and training local terrorist groups by CIA, MI6, Mossad, Al Qaeda and drug cartel recruits, and call them Freedom Fighters ù; then 4 They try to stage mock UN Security Council Resolutions allowing NATO to rain death and destruction over millions of people, and call it Sanctions to Protect Civilians ù; then 5 They invade and begin controlling the target country, and call it Liberation ù; then 6 When the target country falls under their control, they fraudulently impose treacherous caretaker governments and call it Democracy ù, until finally 7 They steal the victim country s oil, mineral and agricultural wealth handing it over to the Corporate and Banking Overworld, also imposing unnecessary Sovereign Debts, and call it Foreign Investment and Reconstruction ù So, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia even Argentina: open your eyes! † Learn to see through the violent use of force in private and hypocrisy in public by the Power Elite Because the day the Global Power Masters decide to come for you, they will say it s all in the name of freedom of speech ù, democracy ù, peace ù, human rights ù, non discrimination ù and other catch phrases Don t fall for it!

"13 Jul, 2011",‚ÄúHundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis‚Äù,"The head of Russia s Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug related deaths since the beginning of this year At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses The reason for most drug related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world s third most heroin consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq Some people, such as Mr Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence For people not involved in gross drug related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0 2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan s enormous drug production As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000 kilometer border with Kazakhstan RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe Mostly it s the Netherlands, where most amphetamine based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels † Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it s nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical No, of course not We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers After all, people are not born addicted to drugs It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents That s when they get to know drugs If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No We are not talking about forced treatment here Any forced treatment is a violation of a person Therefore it s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21] They re punished, and then they re released Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment As I ve said, this is the so called alternative responsibility By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti drugs fundamental conventions RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in this commission I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US Russia Presidential Commission Mr Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we ve been discussing at various international platforms On May 10, I spoke at the G8 s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding This concept hasn t been developed yet In this context, I want to note that the former Under Secretary General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world s leading banks This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set They ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000 Now, they are planning to return these 30,000 So, in fact, nothing has changed I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference It s longer than World War II But the situation in Afghanistan hasn t improved, it has become even worse And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse It s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country So, it s a kind of closed circle In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy The operation was called Äòmashtarak which, if translated from Persian, means Äòtogether  The operation was presented as a brilliant military success Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary We ve started talking about this need at long last It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production I ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan The EU strategy matches very well a Russia drafted plan called ÄúRaduga 2 Äù to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action RT: Thank you very much for your interview VI: Thank you very much RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/hundreds-drug-money-pumped/

"6 May, 2009",Is Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili only pretending to be nuts?,"Georgia s first provocation against Russia came on the eve of the Olympic Games; the latest on the eve of NATO games Now, Russians are anticipating what gift to expect from Tbilisi on New Years Eve Since the moment Mikhail Saakashvili became Georgia s president in January 2004, he has been singularly obsessed, like some sort of modern day Napoleon Bonaparte, with one grandiose idea: expanding his Caucasian fiefdom irrespective of the cost at home and abroad Just months after being sworn into office, Saakashvili s campaign of lebensraum enjoyed early success when his troops seized control of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic, a †small coastal region After splashing around on the beach in Ajaria following the bloodless takeover, Saakashvili told the assembled crowd, This paves the way for Georgia s prosperity It will be the beginning of Georgia s territorial integrity ù Historians, however, and more than one psychiatrist, could cite a long list of other wannabe world conquerors who were seduced by delusions of grandeur after gobbling up a little foreign real estate before going on to menace their peaceful neighbors Unfortunately for Russia, this proved to be the clinical case with Mr Saakashvili In August 2004, and still in a triumphant mood after his Ajaria beach storming, the Georgian president fired a wild shot across Russia s bow by threatening the 7,000 Russian tourists who annually vacation in the breakaway region of Abkhazia I earlier ordered, ùsaid the Georgian Nappy, that we should immediately open fire on, and sink, every ship [cruise ships included] that enters Abkhazia ù Can anybody recall the last time a world leader, no matter how ideologically agitated or mentally unhinged, ordered his troops to deliberately target boats carrying innocent tourists? In some places of the world, this is called piracy I fail to recall even Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saying anything so incredible, and he has said some really incredible things Why, even the Mexicans tolerate chubby Americans wading around in their hotel pools and nude beaches, and the Mexicans lost a lot of real estate in the past to Uncle Sam Yes, Mr Saakashvili, the English speaking †Columbia grad who rode the wave of the Rose Revolution on a surfboard paid for courtesy of the American philanthropist and political meddler, George Soros, specifically told Russian tourists to pay attention ù to his words Well, I m not sure if Russian tourists paid much †heed to the alarming caveat, it s hard to keep Russian tourists away from most places these days, but the Russian authorities certainly did Russian citizens have the right to choose where they want to go on holiday, ùthe Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Any attempts to threaten the lives of Russian citizens will receive the necessary rebuff ù At this point, Moscow s unofficial medical diagnosis of the Georgian president s general state of mind, to roughly translate the Russian saying, was one horse shy of a full troika As previously mentioned, Saakashvili s foreign policy was built on the wobbly foundation of achieving two goals: gaining control of South Osseta and Abkhazia, two territories that have historically remained de facto autonomous regions, with their own unique histories, cultures and languages, despite being absorbed into the Russian empire, and later, the Soviet Union History finally came to a boiling head in 1991 92 during the Georgian South Ossetian conflict After spilling a river of blood that witnessed thousands of refugees fleeing the region from all sides, a Moscow brokered ceasefire was imposed The deal saw Russian peacekeepers stationed on the active fault line between the two hostile camps The fragile peace was shattered during the night of August 7 8, 2008, on the very eve of the Olympic Games in Beijing, when Georgia launched a large scale attack on Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, killing hundreds of citizens, as well as 12 Russian peacekeepers Georgian forces were eventually repelled, and over the course of the 5 day war, the Russian offensive advanced deep inside of Georgian territory The entire world was on the edge of its seat, not knowing to what extent Russia would punish ù Tbilisi But as wild as things were getting on the ground in Georgia, the really crazy war was happening on television screens across the world, with an assortment of talking heads blaming Russia for the conflict But thankfully, the world also got to see a side of the Georgian president that many had not seen before After all, there are some †personality traits †that are a bit difficult to censor In the heat of the battle around Gori, one of the Georgian towns seized by Russian troops, Mr Saakashvili was filmed stepping from a vehicle, where it appeared he was going to give an interview with some reporters Suddenly,apparently overcome with fearat the sight and sound of an imaginary Russian aircraft overhead, Saakashvili made a rather comical dash for cover around a building, with his gun toting security team and news cameras † in hot pursuit They wrestled the president to the ground †amidst loud screams and shouts, bundled him back into the vehicle, and sped off Okay, perhaps we could give Mr Saakashvili the benefit of the doubt on this one I mean, after all, war is no picnic, of course, and who wouldn t get a little freaked out at the thought of an enemy fighter jet aiming its big guns at you in the middle of an interview? But this next one is a bit more difficult to explain as the act of a person in full control of his mental faculties †After a ceasefire was announced between Georgian and Russian troops, BBC, which was preparing to run an interview with the president (who probably got more television coverage in his 5 day Ossetian war than Winston Churchill got in his four year European war), caught Saakashvili unawares as he wasnervously munching away on a perfectly good necktie, eyes shifting side to side, while chatting on the telephone But even with the ugly dog days of war in the rearview mirror, Saakashvili continues to behave extremely irrational whenever Russia is concerned On Tuesday, for example, 500 members of a tank battalion stationed at Georgia s Mukhrovani base, which lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of the capital, mutinied by announcing that they would refuse to participate in operations to break up political protests being held by the opposition After arresting the soldiers, and putting out rewards for the leaders who escaped, the Georgian Interior Ministry said it had uncovered a Russian financed plan to topple Saakashvili s already tenuous hold on power So now Russia is accused of commandeering Georgia s own army! What next? Apparently, even Saakashvili understood how absurd was the allegation and the Georgian authorities quickly changed the story, saying that the mutiny was aimed at disrupting NATO exercises Incidentally, the Georgian opposition, of which there is a growing number, believes Saakashvili staged the failed military coup to discredit the opposition, ùsaid Irakly Batiashvili, a former Georgian state security minister and now an opposition leader, as reported by Interfax Stop the presses! This just in hot off the wires: Saakashvili on Wednesday reportedly told a meeting with his Joints Chief of Staff that Georgian counterintelligence agents arrested a spy at the Georgian diplomatic mission to NATO in Brussels on charges of passing information on the stationing of Georgian troops to the enemy during the August war last year ùThe presumed super spy was allegedly paid just 3,000 euros for passing the top secret information to Russia Is it possible that such information would be given away at such a discount? Furthermore, †if Russia †never heard of Google Maps, †it certainly has its own †highly developed †satellite technology During last year s Valdai conference, which brings together western journalists and top ranking Russian politicians, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev asked a very †pertinent question that needs repeating now: Does NATO need such a leader? ù Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/is-georgian-president-mikhail-saakashvili-only-pretending-to-be-nuts/
"16 Mar, 2009",'US uses Europe as a bridge-head to attack Eurasia',"The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics RT spoke to Graziani in Rome RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures It affects all levels of society In Italy we are seeing more support towards right wing anti immigration policies How can Italy and how can we all outlive the world financial crisis? Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and Japan This crisis has affected the whole world market As for Italy, the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010 Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium enterprises, there s no high concentration of industry, and therefore Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the crisis Anyway, the crisis will be very deep We ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a continental geo economic context It means that we should look for recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as Russia, China and India are going to have their part The crisis cannot be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in Brussels by the europeanunion only RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but still, it was among those taken hostage by it The truth has been concealed What is the real origin of the dispute? T G : The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as EU expansion into Eastern European countries These two coinciding enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close neighbourhood This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall From that moment the United States had decided to manage the whole planet They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it s known that Central Asia has huge resources of gas and oil The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its natural location, or from Moscow If we analyze the so called orangerevolution , we ll realize that behind these achievements of the so called civilsociety of Ukraine were interests coming from across the Atlantic, from Washington We mustn t also forget about the influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian republics When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo political context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it s evident that when it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other Obviously gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine s leaders lack sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests Instead of looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas designated for European nations This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press, including the Italian press In the gas dispute, the majority of Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used geo policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal economic transactions concerning gas RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year T G : I believe it s possible to find an economic agreement Moscow and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts I d like to stress again that it s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and import It s a geopolitical issue It s evident, if Ukraine chooses to set up a Western camp with Washington s leadership, that ll affect not only gas, but also other economic issues as well Hence, I believe, it ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes from Kiev, because it depends on Washington s interests RT: While we re focusing on Washington let s talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here? T G : Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but they aren t politically conscious Thus, in the case of the enlargement of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main argument was environmental And the main motive was hidden as, in reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they d have the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in Serbia, which also depends on Washington In future it ll be possible to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia The Yugoslavian nation, Serbia in this case, wasn t chosen by chance, but because it has some cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia EU relations, many EU states are already looking for alternative suppliers Does Russia need to worry? T G : No, I don t think Russia should worry about it I think every country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning energy supplies and be self sufficient In a wider geo political context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe, between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests: exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources and, obviously, cultural relations I believe cultural relations between the europeanunion and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture If we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the 1930s we ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect language with many borrowed English words It is a result of cultural colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until today It s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in the countries of the former Soviet block RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia EU relations? T G : Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the europeanunion is a potential partner of Russia But to be a real, not just potential, partner Italy should have more liberty and total political sovereignty, which it doesn t have at present I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London RT: You re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world anymore T G : I m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge head to attack the whole Eurasian ground It makes me critical, but, of course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over At present, in the 21st century, on a geo political level we have a multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some states in South America, which are also creating their own geo political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too In particular, major liberties which these South American countries enjoy can allow the europeanunion to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain RT: You travel all over Europe s hotspots and breakaway regions You were monitoring the election in Transdniester There is an island off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that s just declared independence, they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia Is there one universal formula on how to deal with separatism?T G : These issues are absolutely different In Sardinia there is a political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now As for Transdniester, it s necessary to view its situation from the geo strategic point of view The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel the weight of the United States and NATO Transdniester is one of the so called frozen conflicts I think Transdniester s independence would be interesting, because in this case it ll become an area the United States won t be able to enter It ll be a territory of liberty from the Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its sovereignty I don t analyze this republic judging it by its actual government I only analyze its geo strategic and geo political situation Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its small territory there are no NATO bases I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a
