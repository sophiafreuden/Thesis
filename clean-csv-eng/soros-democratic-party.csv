The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing people powered politics to decision making everywhere ùand it s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far right and anti EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right wing and anti establishment groups and parties î and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial Be like Captain Von Trapp reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23 26!pic twitter com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls î but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon org (which has been partly funded by left wing Hungarian American billionaire George Soros) î and its co founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context?

"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary‚Äôs FM: We didn‚Äôt get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People s Party, the center right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps://soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation SS: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news So, the bloc of the centre right parties in the European Parliament, the European People s Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? PS: Look, because Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the European Union as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that s why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs And our position is a very strong anti migration position, which is not shared by many And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements So that s why this is the core of the conflict SS: That s where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you re saying it s much larger of a spectrum, not just centre right, because we get an impression that it s a center right bloc Ok, so that makes sense PS: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament And if you, let s say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you And we have to be honest, European People s Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be SS: So, this suspension happened, took place The head of your Prime Minister s office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP What s going on right now? PS: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People s Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let s put it this way And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP SS: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn t take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote PS: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself SS: So that means, that if it wasn t voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? PS: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow SS: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend PS: Yeah We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing SS: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? PS: No no no We shouldn t confuse the party issue with, let s say, institutional questions The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the European Union, like a cash machine, you know, and don t take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair SS: So you re saying the payouts are not under threat? PS: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well So it s a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long lasting debate or legal procedure SS: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti migrant policy that your country s leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we ve all seen Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? PS: No, no definitely not Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that s going to be the case in the future as well And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don t want that to happen So it s a debate with him, an open debate He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him And my question is, why shouldn t a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary SS: Okay, so let s see how the forces could be re arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro EU, and now it s kind of siding with Italy against Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? PS: Look, I don t think it s fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the European Union SS: Integration, let s put it this way PS: Yeah, yeah, right There s a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward And there are definitely at least two different camps One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels We think it s a dead end street We think this is a bad concept We think that this will not strengthen European Union What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro European position, as we think that the way towards a strong European Union leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong So the debate is rather about that, and that s why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong European Union, but we think that SS: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it s not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you re all part of European Union, you want to be part of European Union, but, like you said, there s definitely two camps One is super pro integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro stronger state and a formal Brussels, let s put it this way So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you ve suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? PS: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we ll see how we go forward But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro migration body And this is something that we don t like SS: So you re leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU s border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation This is a serious accusation PS: These are facts, basically SS: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? PS: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border Let s look at the Internet, at what they have said You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it s not a border protection unit They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together But protecting the entire border to the South of the European Union with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn t know what he or she speaks about We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended SS: Ok, so I m going to play a little bit of devil s advocate, and I m going to tell you what the opposite side is saying The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they re saying it s ludicrous, and it s a conspiracy theory, and they re actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you re not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it s under threat? I just want to hear that PS:Whether the borders are under threat? SS: Do you feel like you re not in control of your own border? PS:We are in control That s why we have built the fence That s why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis A number of them So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border But, you know, it s really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together We think it s a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states SS:So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered PS:Absolutely SS:That s your country as well PS:But this cannot be our country It s physically excluded SS:OK But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary PS:But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary either Greece or Greece and Croatia Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, was that we registered them, and the Greek didn t But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one SS:Another thing Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? PS:Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament Then we don t know the composition of that We don t know the composition of the European Commission So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the European Union, what we see is a huge set of double standards Why? Take the example of Poland The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made They completed all of them from A to Z And what European Commission has done was saying Äúoh, it s not enough, we continue the procedure Äù instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations SS:So I want to talk a little about Hungary s stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that s something that your country speaks very strongly about For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the European Union If that happens, if the pro immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? PS:No, absolutely not That s not in question SS:So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe s population was Muslim And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far fetched, no? He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different PS:Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti anything So we are not anti Muslim We are not anti anything We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent You know, it s unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn t be the case Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo Christian heritage, with its Christian culture And in this regard, I think it s very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate SS:I know you don t like Frontex, but I m still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? PS:You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the European Union, mostly in the Southern and Southern Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe I was in Jordan recently The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom Lebanon the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there The last time the Turkish President has complained about the European Union not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU Turkey deal on migration As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats they ll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing I mean, on the level of European Union, we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the European Union is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe SS:Okay, I get your point Now to a different topic the Russian led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans What s the calculus behind it? What s the logic? PS:Look, now the situation started to change So the International Investment Bank is getting involved in more and more projects in Hungary, financing them We have just inaugurated the first food industry investment, big one, there the IIB was the one to contribute IIB s cooperation with the Hungarian Exim Bank is getting tighter and tighter Now, even the biggest Hungarian companies are working together with IIB on financing There was the first successful issuance of foreign denominated bonds by IIB in the recent days So having the headquarters of IIB in Budapest is something very favourable for Hungary Number one, the more international institutions we have headquartered in Budapest, the better, because the more international we will be You know, when it comes to finances, our economy is in a period of changing dimension So new and modern investments are happening in the country We are looking for financial background So IIB s involvement in financing Hungarian investments is something very crucial for us SS:But the Hungarian Parliament has granted the diplomatic immunity for the bank It s a normal, usual practice with this international institutions But the Western commentators are saying that actually it s a great base for Russia s intelligence services to operate from What do you say to that? PS:You know, I think I surprised these commentators, including the Hungarian opposition, when I ask them whether they know that five out of the nine owners of this bank are NATO member states Period SS:Thank you very much It s been great pleasure talking to you Good luck with everything PS:Thank you for the invitation again Good being here",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/454459-hungarian-fm-peter-szijjarto/

Perhaps George Soros will favour their rampant and so out of touch Europhilia? Perhaps Mr Netanyahu will respond to their unconditional unrequited love of Israel? Perhaps the military industrial complex will be turned on by the group s love of NATO weaponry? Again, how can one tell? And of course if we can t tell we will all just speculate as I ve just done there Then there s the politics themselves I may be wrong and Manchester United may win the Champions League but I m perfectlysure Centrist neo liberal politics are currently out of fashion throughout the world I base this on 14 weeks of mayhem on the streets of France, and not much more than that in President Macron s opinion poll ratings On Mrs Merkel slouching out of the German Chancery in ruins On the Rushmore like ruin of Hillary Clinton On the portrait of Dorian Gray that is the haunted face of the most hated man in Britain, Tony Blair Yet it is the style and program of these discredited hulks, without even a tinge of polish or charisma, that Independent (Ltd) now offers us My bet is there will be few takers My hunch is buttressed by the absolute refusal of the maleficent seven to resign their seats and let their voters judge their betrayal of the banner leader and program under which they were so recently elected They intend to stay ensconced in the mother of parliaments with all its comforts and emoluments essentially under false pretences and for as long as they can All of this would be a little local difficulty not so much of a split as a splinter If not for this Bernie Sanders run for the democraticparty nomination for 2020 has begun The exact playbook practiced against Jeremy Corbyn will be perfected to try and defeat Sanders And no smear will be thought too low to deploy and no deployment thought too frequent Strap yourselves in for Tovarich Bernie the Commie , the friend of terrorists and dictators, the anti Semite (despite being himself Jewish) And if he wins why, there may even be a breakaway!

"14 Feb, 2019","Europe banked on George Soros instead of Viktor Orban, and will suffer the consequences ‚Äì forever","A clash of ideas is occurring in Europe between Hungarian PM Viktor Orban and financier George Soros that will impact the continent forever But Brussels is only interested in considering one option the Soros option Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In any other period of European history, Viktor Orban would have been heralded as a noble statesman by many of his peers The reason is rather straightforward He is attempting to do exactly what other European leaders have done for centuries before him, and that is defending the continent from foreign incursions But these are radical new times and the old rules no longer apply By now, most people are familiar with the mainstream media s narrative on Europe s plight Millions of desperate migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, suffering the untold ravages of war and poverty, are streaming towards Europe s borders in a quest for some semblance of peace and happiness There is a lot of truth to that narrative; millions of innocent people have had their lives totally upended by senseless wars sparked by Western regime change operations They deserve not only sympathy but physical assistance At the same time, however, Europeans are expected to sacrifice everything to assist these new arrivals regardless of the cost And the cost is nothing less than exorbitant InGermany, for example, asylum seekers are entitled to as much as 354 ($400) per month, while the state picks up the tab for rent and medical insurance All told, Germany isexpectedto fork out hold onto your hat 77 6 billion ($86 2 billion) during the period from 2017 to 2020 on feeding, housing and training their new guests In light of that massive assistance, is it any wonder that over one million people crashed Germany s paper border in 2015 alone? This leads us to an obvious question that the Western media never discusses: Would this great migration of people have occurred without the promise of generous handouts by European capitals? It seems that without some sort of security net in place, the majority of these people would not have risked such ahazardousjourney Moreover, there are huge budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored (yet are), for as any economist knows, money does not grow on trees This is Sweden Around 15 cars were set on fire in the city of G√§vle tonight 5 women sexually assaulted in Uppsala this weekend Also, there was 4 bombings in 24 hours This is not the Sweden I used to knowüò≠pic twitter com/f1Oqfr0YYT George Soros, the head of Open Society Foundations, believes he has that problem figured out To finance it, heexplainedcasually, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later Really? Well, judging by the Yellow Vest protests occurring on a weekly basis in the French capital, initially sparked by the imposition of a new fuel tax, we have some good indication as to how enthusiastic Europeans will be for such a plan In short, not very The questions don t end there How is it possible that George Soros has been able to sell his unproven and very expensive plan for open borders to the European people? We can take some guidance from the pithy expression Money talks In that case, nobody has done more talking in Europe than Soros Over the years, the billionaire has assembled some 226 reliableallies in the European Parliament to promote his vision of a brave new Europe This cozy arrangement allowed his Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of Open Society Foundations, tomeetwith members of the European Commission on 65 separate occasions last year alone It s probably safe to say that those closed door meetings had no small impact on the political landscape of Europe Enter Viktor Orban, the bane of Brussels, who is playing a role in European history that cannot be overestimated The leader of fiercely independent Hungary has taken a zero tolerance approach to illegal immigration,refusingto permit a single illegal immigrant to enter his country Meanwhile, other eastern European countries Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which, together with Hungary, form the anti immigration Visegrad Group have takensimilarsteps At the same time, across Europe right wing parties aresurgingin popularity In direct defiance of Brussels, Orban has ordered the construction of a barbed wire fence that runs along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia, a project that the mainstream media somehowconflateswith authoritarianism, as if the concept of national borders never existed before in history OrbansentBrussels a bill for half the cost of the fence, but it was never paid, of course That s too bad, because it could have been the smartest money the EU ever spent, since it would have spared Europeans the influx of mass illegal immigration The Hungarian leader has other ideas that Brussels will probably not be considering any time soon, like ways of addressing Europe s dire demographic problem This month, Orban announced a raft of new tax and loan incentives for families as part of government efforts to boost the birth rate without depending on immigration flows to accomplish that goal There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration, hesaidin his annual state of the nation speech We need Hungarian children The plan has some merit Mothers will be eligible for a 10 million forint ($36,000) subsidized loan, he explained One third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born, and the entire loan waived after a third child is born Now compare Orban s plan with that of the Hungarian born George Soros, who somehow believes that maintaining strong national borders will fragment the union Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union, he wrote in Foreign Policy [T]hey also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards Building on that crooked foundation, SorosadvisedEuropean lawmakers back in 2016 that the EU should spend 30 billion ($34 billion) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year We already know who will be forced to pick up the tab on that massive expenditure, and it s not George Soros One reason that Soros and his 226 reliable allies support the influx of migrants into Europe is they believe it will somehow offset the continent s demographic and labor shortage The latter part of that plan has already been proven a disaster An OECD reportfoundthat less than 40 percent of immigrants had completed an upper secondary school education or higher, while another studyshowedthat only eight percent of asylum seekers were hired by companies as skilled workers Despite clear signs that George Soros grand plans for the European Union are an utter failure, Brussels continues to heed his every word, while at the same time taking steps topunishOrban Just this week, Soroswarned, with no loss of irony, that if Europe doesn t wake up it will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991 The financier fretted over the rise of far right parties in Europe, which he believes will enjoy a competitive advantage in parliamentary elections in May Yes, that is a very big possibility Not once did he suggest, however, that just maybe his grand idea of open borders, made all the more tempting with cash enticements, might just have contributed to that radical disequilibrium of which he spoke If Europe is one day visited by the ghost of its fascist past, George Soros will only have himself to blame Influential people like Soros would have made a far greater impact had they advocated on behalf of peace in the Middle East and North Africa, speaking out on US led interventionist wars that have prompted millions of innocent people to flee their homes Innocent people from war torn countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria deserve the same rights to peace and happiness without having to travel thousands of miles away from home to find it which ironically leads them directly into the homelands of the people who invaded them in the first place! In conclusion, it is highly disturbing that Brussels is willing to give so much credence to a billionaire financier with questionable motives for opening Europe s floodgates to illegal immigration, while vilifying a democratically elected European head of state for attempting to exert some kind of order on a situation that is clearly way out of control @Robert_Bridge Think your friends would be interested?

"29 Dec, 2018",Soros 'person of the year' indeed: In 2018 globalists pushed peoples‚Äô patience to the edge,"Since 2015, the proponents of neoliberalism have been pushing ahead with their plans for open borders and globalist agenda without the consent of the people The last 365 days saw that destructive agenda greatly challenged Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In light of the epic events that shaped our world in 2018, it seems the Yellow Vests the thousands of French citizens who took to the streets of Paris toprotestausterity and the rise of inequality would have been a nice choice for the Financial Times person of the year award Instead, that title wasbestowedupon the billionaire globalist, George Soros, who has arguably done moremeddlingin the affairs of modern democratic states than any other person on the planet Perhaps FT s controversial nomination was an attempt to rally the forces of neoliberalism at a time when populism and nascent nationalism is sweeping the planet Indeed, the shocking images coming out of France provide a grim wake up call as to where we may be heading if the globalists continue to undermine the power of the nation state It is no secret that neoliberalism relentlessly pursues a globalized, borderless world where labor, products, and services obey the hidden hand of the free market What is less often mentioned, however, is that this system is far more concerned with promoting the well being of corporations and cowboy capitalists than assisting the average person on the street Indeed, many of the world s most powerful companies today havemutatedinto stateless superpowers, ù while consumers are forced to endure crippling austerity measures amidplummetingstandards of living The year 2018 could be seen as the tipping point when the grass roots movement against these dire conditions took off Since 2015, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants into Germany and the EU, a groundswell of animosity has been steadily building against the European Union, perhaps best exemplified by the Brexit movement Quite simply, many people are growing weary of the globalistargumentthat Europe needs migrants and austerity measures to keep the wheels of the economy spinning At the very least, luring migrants withcash incentivesto move to Germany andelsewherein the EU appears incredibly shortsighted Indeed, if the globalist George Soros wants to lend hisMidas touchto ameliorating the migrant s plight, why does he think that relocating them to European countries is the solution? As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his Open Society Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East? Soros has an answer for that as well He calls it surge funding, ù which entails raising a substantial amount of debt backed by the EU s relatively small budget ù George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Any guesses who will be forced to pay down the debt on this high risk venture? If you guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the European Union, is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners? Making moral appeals for tolerance towards refugees is futile It does not address the structural cause of problems, or practical solutions We need to engage the issue of refugees and migration directly with policies based on structural analysis European governments along with Washington have to be held accountable for the criminal wars they have inflicted That at least means paying financial reparations for the reconstruction of nations blown apart by militarism Stop the wars, pay for damages and reconstruction, and the refugee problem is largely curbed On economics, the real problem is the bankrupt capitalist system It impoverishes billions of people, both within so called developed countries and elsewhere, leading to mass migration and deep rancor in destination countries READ MORE:Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire Can it bring down the American Empire? If European countries or the US were run on a more democratic, productive and socially beneficial economic system, instead of neoliberal austerity exploiting inequality, then much of the public resentment and fear of foreigners would not be such a concern And anti immigrant political parties would have much less of a constituency Thus, stop economically crushing people with bankrupt economics, and many of the social and political problems of xenophobia and populist revolt would diminish Imperialist wars and destructive capitalism are the root problems We d better deal with them The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/443776-migratns-poverty-war-eu-soros/

"1 Nov, 2018",Mass migration brought down the Roman Empire. Can it bring down the American Empire?,"The migrant caravan heading north to the US from Central America is further evidence that the old world is dying and the new struggles to be born There is much the ancient world can teach us; and one of its most salient lessons is that mass migration the product of conflict, societal collapse and/or extreme poverty is capable of destroying the most powerful of empires Consider Rome, whose legions bestrode the ancient world like a colossus for a thousand years, and whose great and cruel, and most illustrious names Caesar, Pompey, Augustus, Nero, Hadrian, Vespasian, Constantine, et al still induce awe and wonder despite the passage of millennia At its height, it would have been the very acme of insanity to claim that an empire that stretched from the Italian peninsula all the way across Western Europe and down into North Africa and the Middle East, could possibly be erased from the pages of history Yet erased it was when in 476 CE, what was then known as the Western Roman Empire was brought to its knees after successive barbarian invasions, made up of Germanic tribes, finally succeeded in penetrating the borders of the empire, leading ultimately to itsdemise The symbols of Roman power the imperial vestments, diadem and purple cloak were sent to Constantinople (Istanbul), the seat of power of the eastern half of the empire at that time It brought the curtain down on hundreds of years of history, confirming that no empire, regardless of its economic and military might, lasts in perpetuity In truth, Rome s demise had been a long time coming; the contradictions of an empire run on the basis of slavery, tribute, and plunder were so great it was inevitable they would become insurmountable Under Rome s rule, millions lived in poverty and squalor, supporting an elite whose wealth and ostentation was so obscene it became increasingly untenable By now, hopefully, a measure of drift is being got Any economic system that operates on the basis of coercion, domination, and hyper exploitation gives rise to resistance This in turn leads to more force being deployed to maintain it, which only succeeds in catalyzing more resistance and, with it, destabilization It is this destabilization that produces the mass movement of people and peoples This, in sum, is what ended Rome, doing so in a dynamic the early stages of which are evident in our time with a growing migration crisis slowly and incrementally chipping away at the foundations of Western hegemony The 2015 refugee crisis that beset Europe, and which remains unresolved, is a case in point, as is the aforementioned migrant caravan, currently wending its way to the US border through Mexico from Central America Here we are obliged to take a quick detour and address the tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theory brigade whose increasing number reflects not growing awareness but rising lunacy The notion that the migrant caravan is a Soros funded stunt and/or democraticparty ruse in the run up to the US midterm elections is nothing if not preposterous The suffering endured over generations by the peoples of Central America due to the militarism and economic domination of the US has and continues to be inordinate Therefore denying its victims agency is tantamount to denying them dignity Honduras, from where the migrant caravan originates, was the scene of a coup in 2009, which succeeded in toppling the democratically elected leftist government of Manuel Zelaya The coup was led by General Romeo VasquezVelasquez, graduate of the notoriousSchool of the Americas(renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation in 2001) at Fort Benning, Georgia Thousands of military and security personnel from Central and Latin America have been trained in torture, assassination, and repression there since WWII Accordingto US foreign policy specialist Professor Stephen Zunes, the Honduran coup, which took place under Obama s watch with Hillary Clinton in post as secretary of state, ushered in a period of horrific repression and [a] skyrocketing murder rate [resulting in] tens of thousands of refugees fleeing for safety ù Though Zunes is careful not to allege Washington s direct involvement in the coup, the conspicuous refusal to call for the restoration of the country s legitimate president in the aftermath tells us everything we need to know with regard to an agenda that has for centuries viewed the various nations of this benighted region as a wholly owned subsidiary So now we have a migrant caravan making its way north and in Washington, President Donald Trump, describing it as aninvasionwhile deploying 5,000 troops to the border Though every occupant of the White House since time immemorial has made a virtue of injustice, in Trump, the Roman philosopher Seneca s words spring singularly to life: For greed all nature is too little ù The greed for wealth, power, status, and fame that drives and determines Trump s every wheeze is symptomatic of the sick society and cultural values of which he is product It is those values responsible for the migrant caravan, and it is those values that will produce in time the downfall of the empire that occupies the space in our world that Rome occupied in its What cannot be denied, no matter the industrial scale national propaganda produced to the contrary, is that the masses of the poor and oppressed in the US have far more in common with the people on this migrant caravan than they could ever possibly have with their own ruling class Ensuring that they never latch onto this fact is all that lies between their continued parlous condition and liberation not to mention that of the continent and world entire The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442864-american-empire-migrant-caravan/

"27 Oct, 2018","Republicans & Democrats may bark and bite, but the migrant caravan moves on","On the eve of midterms, thousands of migrants are streaming towards the US through Mexico with dreams of entering America The crisis has turned into a slippery political football in a coliseum called Washington Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge For those of us living cozy, self indulgent lives, complete with cappuccino mornings and cocktail sunsets, it is hard to imagine a level of economic deprivation so severe it could actually force people to pack their bags and trek thousands of miles in search of some semblance of happiness Yet that is exactly what is happening now as an estimated 10,000 poverty stricken migrants, the majority from Honduras, have set off on a modern day odyssey in the hope of reaching the Promised Land, where potholes are filled with gold and cotton candy hangs heavy from trees But what has made this march particularly sensational is that it is happening at the most pivotal moment as far as American politics is concerned Obsessed with the upcoming midterm elections, the Democrats and Republicans are piling on the emergency like a fumbled ball, trying to use the crisis to win extra points before November 6th Such political maneuvering sees both parties occasionally flip flopping on their platforms or twisting information for the purpose of gaining an edge In fact, many Americans would probably be surprised to know that under the leadership of Barack Obama, the Democrats who havecomparedTrump to Hitler over his efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border deporteda whopping 2 5 million undocumented people from the United States by 2015 Equally surprising is that under the tenure of Obama s Republican predecessor, George W Bush, the Republicans deported just 2 million undocumented people And then there was Hillary Clinton On the campaign trail in 2007, shetolda rally the federal government is supposed to set immigration policy ù That comment should have carried a footnote that reads, Unless you are Donald Trump In other words, in this brutal political game, the goalposts continuously shift to accommodate the changing winds Meanwhile, the GOP is also guilty of its own false starts Indeed, many Republicans view the timing of this massive movement of people as more than just a coincidence, looking to borderline conspiracy theories to explain it I agree with President Obama 100%!pic twitter com/PI3aW1Zh5Q Last week, for example, Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz tweeted out a video that shows a long line of women, many of them holding children, accepting cash from two young men Gaetz assumed that the video was made in Honduras, but in fact it showed the migrants somewhere in Guatemala on their way towards Mexico Although he got the location wrong which he lateracknowledged the video succeeds in raising far more questions than answers Gaetz could not resist dropping the name of George Soros, the billionaire bugbear of the political right who provides funding for a long list of political and civic groups BREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time Soros? US backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!pic twitter com/5pEByiGkkN One such group that has benefited from Soros financial support is the non profit organization, Skylight, which is embedded with the caravan for the stated purpose of filming the migration In 2016, the group received a 1 million dollar contribution by Foundation to Promote Open Society (2016 tax return, page 287, Skylight Engagement Inc ) Although this does not necessarily prove anything untold is happening, Skylight s presence in the caravan has raised some eyebrows among Republicans Open Society denies any involvement in assisting the migrants on their journey Video taken by our crew on the ground with the#HonduranCaravanshowing thousands of migrants making their way into Mexico at the#Mexico/#Guatemalaborder üá¨üáπ üá≤üáΩ üé•#MigrarEsUnDerecho#CaravanadeMigrantes#Skylightpic twitter com/fP4KgKKEvE This is a monumental undertaking, and already the march is taking its toll Mexican officials say 1,740 migrants have applied for asylum and hundreds more have taken up offers of bus rides back to Honduras, ù APreported Whatever the case may be, Trump is urging Mexico to crackdown on the marching migrants before they reach the US border The US leader s uneasiness about the situation is understandable In the event that even a fraction of the migrants reach the US border before the midterms, it would place the Republicans in a tricky predicament If the US National Guard, for example, is forced to push back against migrant women and children (who will certainly be sent to the front of the receiving line for maximum visuals) it may spell disaster for the Republicans in the midterms Such stark images will conjure up memories of Trump s failed zero tolerance immigration policy that separated children from their parents at the border, as well as the misconception that Trump is somehow a racist for wanting to build a wall on the Mexican border Now two days in a row Happening all over again pic twitter com/r1RYRnbF0n On the other hand, the image of thousands of migrants storming the US border might get Republicans off the couch and to the polls in record numbers At the same time, other Trump supporters will be asking, yet again, why the wall Trump promised to buildremainsa pipe dream Such questions could ultimately work to the Republicans advantage, in that the Democrats have vigorously opposed most Republican projects to date, not least of all the border wall Ironically, however, had the Democrats performed this simple construction task during Barack Obama s two term presidency, Trump, who built his campaign on the promise of protecting America s border, would most likely never have had the rallying cry he needed to become president Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on@foxandfriendsthat the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border MUST BE CHANDED, but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency They will be stopped! At this point, I would like to say that, as an American, it is difficult to fathom how the question of a strong border has become such a political football The United States has a very fair system for allowing people to become naturalized citizens, and asylum seekers are accorded all the protections mandated by the law The only requirement is that migrants follow the legal procedures for entry, and if that sounds like a radical or xenophobic idea, as many Liberals today seem to believe, then the majority of countries in the world would have to be classified as racist Somehow the US went from being an ethnically diverse country comprised of law abiding immigrants, to a nation that thinks it s alright to accept law breaking border jumpers as future citizens In times past, before the age of virtue signaling, social justice warriors and PC dementia was all the rage, a group of undocumented people storming the US border would have been dealt with in the appropriate manner, and without any questions asked Today, however, many Western governments have been infected by the globalist creed, Merkel style, that says it is the duty of Western democracies to let oppressed migrants into their countries en masse and unmolested Meanwhile, it is the migrants who areportrayedas heroes in the Western media, while the people who want to defend their borders are some sort of knuckle dragging xenophobes In the case of the European Union, countries that fight back against the concept of loose borders, like Hungary, for example, are treated like pariah states, even suffering severe disciplinary action The situation is so grave and arouses so many different emotions that the issue of borders actually has the power to break up the West into two camps the nationalists on one side and the globalists on the other When one looks a bit deeper at the situation, the Liberal desire to accept migrants with open arms is dripping with hypocrisy and not a little blood After all, if the Democrats (and Republicans) really wanted to address the problem of mass migration at the root they would be out on the streets demanding that their governments cease and desist from waging war on sovereign states That is the real reason why so many people are fleeing their homes for a new life military aggression It s a national embarrassment that a group of illegal immigrants can cross our border and receive free healthcare/benefits, while veterans that have served this country are put on a waiting list Even tiny Honduras is no stranger to such violence This is something the Democrats should understand given former president Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton s botched efforts toinfluencethe Honduras military coup of 2009 In fact, that event, which brought to power a far right strongman, Pepe Lobo Sosa, goes far at explaining the caravan now ascending upon the US border In short, if the West would simply stop pursuing war and chaos around the world, much of which is based on avarice and empire building, the question of stronger borders would no longer be an issue, and those innocent people now in the firing line of NATO armies could rest easily knowing they can build prosperous lives in their own countries @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/442423-migrants-caravan-midterms-crisis/

country can be stripped of its voting rights, and turned into a humiliated outcast at every European meeting More likely, any specific proposed sanctions would incentivize changes to avoid that fate This procedure serves as a perfect illustration of the European Union s convoluted and slow †decision making style There are at least nine distinct steps between a supposed breach being identified, and a country being actually sanctioned, with seven separate votes †needed from the European Council, European Commission and European Parliament, requiring thresholds from one third, to two thirds,

Article 7 And the one time it legally had the option against Austria s populists back in 2000 it quickly inserted extra necessary steps into the process to make an actual invocation less likely While Article 7 proceedings have never got as far as the MEP vote before Hungary, it is the next step that looks impassible The European Council, which represents the heads of all the 28 states, would have to agree with the MEPs, and do so unanimously Several countries are almost guaranteed to veto this step Poland, undergoing a near identical EU investigation, which Hungary has said it will veto, is certain to disagree, as are Hungary s other Visegrad Four allies Czechia and Slovakia and more EU states opposed to multiculturalism, migration and potential Brussels meddling in internal affairs In fact, in view of today s proceedings, even the Conservative controlled UK will likely vote against the Article 7 invocation So, what we are actually seeing is not the show trial ùspoken of by Farage,

"9 Apr, 2018",Orban's win speaks to growing tide of anti-EU feeling,"Viktor Orban s landslide win in Hungary s parliamentary elections on Sunday has handed him a fresh mandate and four more years to torment Brussels with his anti immigration policies and Euroskeptic rhetoric is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Orban s victory is a huge win for anti EU parties across Europe and a humiliation and headache for Brussels The Hungarian leader has been a thorn in Brussels side in recent years, with his staunchly anti migration stance perhaps the biggest bone of contention In his final speech before Hungarians went to the polls, Orban once again took aim at Europe s controversial migration policies Immigration is the blight that slowly but surely devours our homeland, he said Mass migration threatens the everyday security to which we are accustomed With mass migration comes a greater threat of terror With near record voter turnout, Orban s Fidesz has won 133 parliamentary seats of 199, giving him the supermajority needed to make constitutional changes While the United Kingdom has caused a headache for Brussels by voting to leave the EU, Hungary has caused somewhat of a headache by staying and upsetting the Western liberal apple cart One liberal Hungarian friend who contacted me as the results came in was sorely disappointed No one was expecting Orban to lose, but nor were they expecting his win to be so resounding In fact, in the months leading up the elections, there was an air of cautious optimism from the opposition parties There had been some heated debate over how leftists should approach the spring election Some strongly advocated joining with the far right Jobbik party in an effort to prevent Orban from further consolidating his power Other liberals were vehemently opposed to such an alliance, a deal with the devil, so to speak but at the end of the day, it didn t matter The Hungarian left is made up of a number of small parties the Green LMP ( Politics Can Be Different ), the socialist MSZP, the Democratic Coalition (DK) and some tiny parties like Egyutt ( Together ) and Momentum A typical complaint among Hungarian liberals is that these parties suffer from a serious case of disorganization and an inability to work together to achieve common aims The satirical Two Tailed Dog party, which ran on promises of free beer and eternal life, won three times as many votes as Egyutt a result which should surely convince them of the importance unity on the left if they ever want to put a dent in Fidesz s power Hungarian elections are generally regarded as being carried out fairly and legitimately There is no suggestion that this vote was tampered with or fixed in any way Following the 2014 parliamentary elections, OSCE monitorsconcludedthat Hungarians were offered a genuine choice and that elections were carried out transparently and efficiently That, however, does not mean the election system is entirely fair, either The OSCE also said that Fidesz enjoyed undue advantage due to a number of factors, including biased media coverage (due to state interference with independent media) and gerrymandered districts This is a fair assessment and as I havewritten before, is comparable to many other countries, including the United States, where third party candidates receive scant media coverage and where gerrymandering and political corruption are also serious issues There has been some rather odd media and political reaction to Orban s victory Stefan Simanowitz, Amnesty International s media manager for Europe,tweetedout a Guardian report on the election, saying that people in Hungary are bracing themselves for a torrid four years after Orban s win In reality, the majority of Hungarians are clearly satisfied with the outcome, having made the decision to vote for Fidesz so the idea that people in general in Hungary are unhappy with the result does not stand up to reason In fairness, if people in Hungary are bracing themselves for a torrid four years, why did Fidesz win so easily? The US/UK media doesn t seem to be interested in Orban s supporters, who are also people This is similar to how they cover Russia https://tdotco /55X13VbE3e Former US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder added his voice to the Western chorus of anger over Orban s win, tweeting that European leaders who care about liberalism should impose real costs on Hungary This puts a rather interesting spin on liberalism and democracy Is Daalder suggesting Hungarians who cast their votes for the candidates of their choice be punished in some way for doing so? Are election results in the EU only legitimate when the outcome suits Brussels? Hungary deals another blow to liberalism, with Fidesz and Jobbik winning 70% of vote Long past time that leaders who still care about liberalism (Merkel, Macron, Tusk) let their voices be heard, take action and impose real costs Despite what Western media †might have us believe, Orban is far from on his own in Europe His victory speaks to a growing tide of anti EU feeling across the 28 member bloc Horst Seehofer, Germany s federal interior minister whose Bavarian CSU party is an important ally to Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats said he was pleased with Orban s clear victory and warned that the arrogance and paternalism with respect to other member states coming from Brussels is wrong Merkel and Seehofer are currently at odds over Germany s immigration policies Italy s Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti migration Northern League, and whose center right alliance is now the biggest political bloc in the country, congratulated Hungarians on defending their own companies, their own workers, their own students, their own future and their own borders France s National Front leader Marine Le Pen said Orban s win reflected the rejection of the mass immigration policies favored by Brussels and tweeted optimism that nationalists could win a majority in the 2019 European Parliament elections Hungary has its fair share of problems and Orban has undoubtedly moved toward a more authoritarian style of leadership Nonetheless, his win is legitimate and will empower him further There is already talk of a crackdown on non governmental organizations as part of Orban s long running feud with liberal Hungarian billionaire George Soros The Stop Soros package of laws would target non governmental organizations which support migration Among the proposals is a 25 percent tax on foreign donations received by those NGOs Orban can now go to Brussels with an even clearer mandate than he had before, which will be much to his benefit His victory and unwavering commitment to his party s policies in the face of extreme criticism will also inspire other anti EU, anti immigration parties across the EU to follow in Orban s footsteps where they can The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/423629-hungary-orban-election-anti-eu/

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of colorrevolution s ù around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first colorrevolution , ùa technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed There is just one problem None of it is true The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned ùfrom Communism and despoiled in the process Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed ù the creation of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election Meanwhile, a student movement called Otpor (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US trained activists, like Srda Popovic Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience Suitcases of cash ù smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5 Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum As a result, ƒêindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist ù expediency Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre or post electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the orangerevolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, colorrevolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences there is always the next revolution to plan and execute And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator ù(there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems Before the dust from the revolution clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters While the colorrevolution s are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago Nebojsa Malic for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/
"8 Sep, 2017","More than 140,000 Americans sign petition against George Soros, but will it make a difference?","A petition to the White House calling for Hungarian American billionaire George Soros to be declared a terrorist has garnered more than 140,000 signatures, far exceeding the 100,000 needed to require an official response from the administration is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Thepetition, which also calls on the government to seize all of Soros assets, argues the billionaire has willfully and on an ongoing basis attempted to destabilize and otherwise commit acts of sedition ùagainst the United States Also that he has developed unhealthy and undue influence over the entire Democrat Party and a large portion of the US Federal government ù Whatever about the terrorist ùpart, it is at least true that Soros maintains an unhealthy influence over the democraticparty , as well as political systems around the world besides the United States Soros was Hillary Clinton s top donor in the 2016 election and has for decades used his vast wealth to influence politics, stir discontent and profit off chaos in countries under the guise of philanthropy and humanitarianism But Soros (and many of his beneficiaries) represent a disturbing hypocrisy Claiming to support and promote democracy the world over, Soros actions consistently undermine it Or, as one writer for The Observerput it: there is nothing philanthropic about drowning a democracy in money ù Drowning a democracy in money is exactly what Soros does î and it has very little to do with philanthropy, fairness or social conscience Soros funded Democrats routinely attack anyone who truly dares to challenge the system that allows a few billionaires to maintain far more control over democracies ù than the regular people who live and vote in them Look no further than the vicious attacks on Bernie Sanders î a candidate who at least had the integrity toshunthe Super PACS he believes are infecting American democracy Even after her loss to Donald Trump, Clinton is still taking aim at Sanders î a man who endorsed her despite revelations that she and a supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee secretly worked in cahoots to scuttle his massively popular campaign Soros has been eulogized by the left and reviled by the right As such, much of the criticism of him is found on right leaning websites and blogs, while the liberal mainstream steers clear î a distinct contrast with how they treat billionaires like the Koch brothers who funnel billions into the pockets of Republicans The Americans signing the petition are unhappy about Soros funding of movements like Black Lives Matter and hislinksto violent far left groups Some of the more conspiracy minded believe Soros himself orchestrated and funded both sides of the violent protests in Charlottesville last month Many of Soros critics take legitimate criticism too far, either by accusing him of being behind anything and everything that irks them or by using antisemitic slurs against him This allows Soros defenders to then paint anyone who takes issue with him as a crazy and antisemitic Soros himself falls into a similar trap, however, when he tries to pin all the world s ills and evils on Vladimir Putin The result is only to make himself look stupid But there s another interesting twist at play here While Americans of a certain political stripe have every right to be upset with Soros and his efforts to influence politics in the US, they are often strangely quiet when he does it overseas Neither are many of them particularly interested when their own government engages in the same exact behavior (often in league with Soros himself) to promote revolution ù and overthrow foreign governments In fact, when Washington engages in this kind of behavior, they are often more than willing to cheer it on Accusing Soros of funding fake news ù Nazis in Charlottesville is one thing, but when he helped the US government install real Nazis into power Ukraine in 2014, not many Americans on either the left or right were too bothered They certainly weren t signing petitions calling for their government to be labeled a terrorist state, anyway Strange indeed, how acts of sedition ùare something to take seriously only when you think they might affect you and your own political agenda But Soros, famed for his liberal politics, has no qualms using his $25 billion fortune to fund conservatives either Take, for example, the $100,000 hedonatedto top Senate warmonger John McCain s legacy ù foundation, which also accepted $1 million from Saudi Arabia A credible collection of democracy loving philanthropists, indeed A skeptic might cynically surmise that Soros is not really a bleeding heart liberal and altruist after all, but a billionaire willing to throw money at whoever he believes will preserve the system that made him rich The chances the White House will take this petition seriously are basically zero Liberals, conservatives, it doesn t matter; the lot of them are all knee deep in the same dung Soros and Trump may hate each other insofar as their political worldviews differ, but what matters to them more than anything is money Public fights mask private elbow rubbing Sorosmingledwith Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner at a recent Hamptons soir√©e hosted by a former Washington Post editor Kushner, by the way, founded a real estate

White House hadreceivedsecession petitions from all 50 states through the We The People ù initiative set up by the Obama administration The initiative initially required a petition to receive only 25,000 signatures before a response from the White House î a naive underestimation of how many people will sign petitions as a joke Like, for example, the onesuggestingthat Friday should be officially

"7 Aug, 2017",Reports of Hungary‚Äôs slide into ‚Äòdictatorship‚Äô have been exaggerated,"Is Hungary sliding into tyranny and dictatorship? According to headlines which have painted a rather grim picture of Hungary s present and future under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the answer is a resounding yes is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Hungary is held hostage ùby tyrant ùOrban who is returning the country to totalitarianism, ùclaims The New Statesman The International Business Times worries about Hungary s dark path toward dictatorship ù The EU struggles to contain dictator ùOrban, says the Sydney Morning Herald Orban is Europe s enemy within, ùwarns the Financial Times He is Europe s New Dictator, ùsays Politico These attention grabbing headlines and dramatic portrayals exaggerate the political situation in Hungary Of course, there are plenty of legitimate complaints to be made about Orban (though, naturally, the specifics of the complaint will vary based on who is speaking) The problem is that the media has taken those complaints, exaggerated and embellished them, and used them to predict this country s slide into absolute tyranny irresponsibly This distorts reality and lessens the readers ability to understand what is going on in Hungary Brussels likes to believe it promotes democracy within the 28 EU member states Yet, when Orban begins to implement policies that they don t like (but that his voters support), he becomes an outcast Those shouting dictator! ùfail to take into account the wishes of the many Hungarians who voted for Orban s reelection in 2014 and who support many of his policies Disregarding the will of the people to score ideological points about democracy is ironic indeed Let s break it down Hungarian PM Orban pledges to support Poland against European inquisition https://tdotco /9GAoCzB8TE When considering the legitimacy of the claim that Hungary is sliding into dictatorship, we should start with the basics Orban is a legitimately elected prime minister The freeness of recent elections in Hungary has not been called into question Following the latest parliamentary elections in 2014, which saw Orban and his conservative political alliance re elected, there was debate (within Hungary, I should add) over whether undue advantage was given to the ruling Fidesz party through acombination of factors î including gerrymandering districts and biased media reporting No doubt these factors do give an advantage to the ruling party, but it would not be entirely unfair to compare this to the undue advantage afforded to the two mainstream parties in the United States Democrat and Republican candidates enjoy massive free media coverage and an immediate sense of legitimacy, while third party candidates are all but shunned and treated as an amusing sideshow by mainstream media The US regards itself as the greatest democracy in the world As for gerrymandering, it ishardlya Hungarian phenomenon Overall, the OSCE monitors of Hungary s parliamentary electionsconcludedthat Hungarians were offered a genuine choice ùin competitive elections ùThey said the process was transparently and efficiently administered ù The OSCE criticized the partisan composition ùof the National Election Commission and media regulations which favored Fidesz but said the candidate registration process was inclusive Interestingly, Western coveragefocused onlyon the OSCE s criticisms, failing to give a full picture which included improvements to the system Ultimately, when Hungary holds elections, candidates from across the political spectrum win seats î from the governing party, from the left and right wing opposition î and occasionally independents Sometimes the polls predict outcomes accurately, other times they are off None of this is typical of a dictatorship One of the major criticisms of Orban is that he has destroyed free media in Hungary It is true that Hungary s media environment is not free from state interference State media act, by and large, as free advertising and propaganda for Fidesz and Orban There is often pressure put on independent media and Orban allies have been busybuying upmedia outlets Nonetheless, it is completely untrue to suggest that Orban has managed to decimate the free press entirely There are plenty of available outlets that dedicate a lot of their time to bashing the ruling party, online and in print and radio Independent journalists regularly unearth cases of government corruption î and anyone is free to read them Hungarians are more than aware of government corruption and are not happy about it Public opinion in 2016 showed that 56 percent of people believe the government only pursues corruptionselectively In 2014, the governmentshelved a planto introduce a tax on internet data usage after pressure through massive street protests The protesters argued that levying fees on internet usage would restrict access to free information î and the protesters won At the time, the BBCwrotethat Orban was more flexible than many analysts give him credit for ùTypically, street protests don t work in dictatorships If international rankings are your cup of tea, take a look at the 2017 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index Hungary does not rank particularly well î but Greece, Israel and Japanrank worse One of the biggest criticisms of Orban came this year over the controversy surrounding the George Soros founded, Budapest based Central European University The controversy was caused by an amendment to the law on higher education which meant the university would no longer be allowed to issue diplomas accredited in the United States unless it operated a campus there Until now, it has been allowed to do just that This naturally made the university highly marketable to students But non CEU students were at a disadvantage, according to the government s argument The law change was framed as a total and utter assault on freedom Reports in Western publicationsmade it soundas though the university was being forced to shutter its doors on the spot for no reason î or simply because of its association with Orban foe Soros In reality, the university will not be forced to close It will be compelled to comply with a new law which removes part of its competitive advantage (issuing US accreditation) Whether you believe this is fair or not, it is hard to argue the reporting on the controversy gave a full and balanced picture The law prompted huge street protests; some of the biggest Budapest has seen in years There is no question a lot of Hungarians are fired up against Orban over the CEU move But that is not the opinion across the board While on the one hand, I ve seen Hungarians waving signs comparing Orban to Hitler, I ve also spoken to Hungarians who support the amendment to the education law, completely agreeing with the position that CEU should not be afforded any sort special treatment Calling Orban a dictator or tyrant over something like this again disregards widespread opinion in favor of ideological point scoring An opinionpollin May saw the ruling party and Orban s personal support drop since the CEU spat in January î but that could also be to do with other things; like the fact that half of all Hungarians can t afford a one week foreign holiday Israel backs Hungary s anti Soros campaign, saying financier continually undermines Jewish State https://tdotco /ksOiPRdcQt The policy that has caused Orban to be most reviled by many Western democracies, however, has been his decision to refuse to comply with an EU resettlement plan for hosting refugees across member states But again, Orban is not alone in his thinking A referendum in 2016 saw 98 percent of Hungarian voterssay no to Brussels EU migrant quotas Turnout, however, was low, at about 44 percent î below the 50 percent required to make the referendum valid under the law Orban s commentary on refugees has beeninflammatory; some would argue outright racist But racist and inflammatory commentary doesn t make one a dictator î especially when 98 percent of people who showed up to vote agree with you Regardless, Hungary is pushing ahead with its stance on illegal immigration, even holding those who enter the country in detention centers at the border The government claims it is doing this to uphold the Schengen agreement which is being abused ùas migrants travel freely to reach their country of choice in Western Europe The country also built a fence along its border with Serbia hoping to lower the number of refugee crossings This again is a subject which deeply divides people and ignites passions But believing Orban s policies on migration are cruel or immoral does not make him a dictator What s more, it s ludicrous to ignore that his policies are in line, for the most part, with the will of the people Incidentally, Orban is also accused of fueling extremism and anti Semitism While he certainly does whip up nationalist fervor, it is misleading to call him an anti Semite It israrelypointed out that Orban s government introduced a Holocaust memorial day, compulsory Holocaust education in schools and made Holocaust denial illegal Western reporting frequently fails to give a full picture of the situation in Hungary in much the same way it does about any country that fails to live up to arbitrarily set standards for what constitutes a good or a bad country Unfortunately, some in the Hungarian opposition fuel unbalanced portrayals of the country because the louder they shout, the more vehement Western journalists will shout with them î and the more attention they will receive What I have been struck by, having spent the last ten months in this country, is that this is not the way average Hungarians seem to think of their country Many are of course vehemently anti Orban, many are pro Orban But even those against him are often baffled by Western coverage The late Imre Kertesz, the first Hungarian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature,decried talk of dictatorshipin Hungary as empty ideological language ù In a 2014 interview with The Hungarian Quarterly, Kertesz revealed that a reporter from the New York Times had called him with the intention of getting me to say that Hungary is a dictatorship today, which it isn t ù That only means that he [the reporter] has no idea what a dictatorship is If you can write, speak openly, openly disagree, even leave the country, it is absurd to speak of a dictatorship, ùKertesz said I am not pleased with everything happening in Hungary I do not think there was ever a time when I was pleased with everything happening here but certainly, Hungary is no dictatorship This is empty ideological language to call Hungary a dictatorship today ù Most notably, Kertesz said the interview in which he failed to call his country a dictatorship was never published î and that in itself is a kind of censorship ù Exaggerating Hungary s political situation distorts not only the present but the past To speak of Orban s dictatorship ùis a slap in the face to those who lived and still do live under real dictatorships The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization

"8 Apr, 2017",George Soros and Viktor Orb√°n go to war in Budapest,"Hungary s pressure on George Soros Budapest university is about more than the future of one school It s part of an ideological battle which will dominate European and North American discourse in the coming years Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Whatever you might say about Viktor Orban, he s a fast and decisive mover Last Sunday, when thousands demonstrated in Budapest against his proposal to tighten regulation on foreign universities, marchers spoke of a lengthy campaign of resistance Two days later, it was a done deal Orban had rushed the bill through parliament, displaying an efficiency Angela Merkel would admire, if she didn t distrust him for other reasons His target was Soros, Hungary s wealthiest son, who has become a hate figure for nationalists across Europe And a man who divides a country Many Hungarians admire Soros s philosophy and see him as a benefactor However, more again see his influence as nefarious and reject his ethos of globalist Atlanticism For liberals, Hungary has been a huge disappointment Because, back in the early 90 s, it was considered the most westernized of the ex Warsaw pact states And only 20 years ago, the Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats held an overwhelming majority in parliament Yet, with the country facing bankruptcy, they were forced †to implement a hugely unpopular austerity package that allowed Orban s Fidesz party to jump from 20 to 148 seats in the 1998 election For the next decade, the two blocs fought a close battle until the latter took control in 2010, with the Socialists mortally wounded by accusations of rampant corruption, which even led to riots Since then, Orban used his huge 2010 majority to change the constitution and has proven himself something of a chameleon For instance, he has simultaneously cultivated close relations with both Vladimir Putin and Poland s hyper patriotic government And although Russian companies have won significant contracts in the transportation and energy sectors, every time anti Moscow sanctions have come before the European Union, Budapest has faithfully backed them Inside the EU, Hungary s attitude to migrants has often created outrage For instance, when Angela Merkel was opening Germany s doors, Orban was constructing a wall to keep the newcomers out However, Fidesz, politically connected to Merkel s CDU movement through Brussels European People s Party grouping, has paradoxically proven to be its most loyal supporter in European parliament votes Fidesz MEPs vote 98 percent with us even more than the Germans, an EPP officialtoldPolitico this week †This displays the genius of Orban s double game Because while he s been busy dismantling liberal democracy in Hungary, EU grant aid has kept rolling in, averaging 2 4 percent of GDP from 2004 2014 And discontent in Brussels has been measured in murmurs, rather than roars Even the Americans seem relatively quiet, meekly observing this week how Washington is disappointed by the accelerated passage of legislation targeting (the) Central European University ùAt the same time, his government s overtures to Donald Trump, which it considers a like minded potential ally, have been met with silence While everybody knows that Orban s obvious desire is to clip Soros wings, the actual legislation itself is slightly more vague It forces foreign universities to close unless there s a bilateral agreement in place between Hungary and their home ùgovernment and they have a campus abroad In the case of the Central European University, the only option is to open a mothership in the US or head for the hills As a result, other locations, in Austria, Romania and Lithuania, have been offering themselves as alternatives The CEU was founded in 1991 in Prague, before former President Vaclav Klaus booted it out a few years later Back then its stated mission was to educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region ùBy the year 2000, it had moved onto a special emphasis on democracy promotion and human rights ùAmong its alumni are Azeri dissidents Ilgar Mammadov and †Rashadat Akhundov, Serbian pro NATO activist Srƒëan Cvijiƒá and current Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili Thus, many local influencers fear Budapest has been hosting its own colour revolution ùfactory Orban and Soros have had their share of mutual grievances Two years ago, the Prime Minister accused the billionaire of being responsible for the migrant crisis His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle, ùhe told a radio station These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros shot back, saying he was trying to uphold European values ùwhile Orban s actions undermined those values ù In February of this year, the feud intensified Large bodied predators are swimming here in the waters This is the trans border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery, ùOrbaninsisted It is causing trouble that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics, ù Orban s party is fully on board Fidesz deputy chairman, Szilard Nemeth,said †in December that Donald Trump s US election win was a game changer: these organisations must be pushed back with all available tools, and I think they must be swept out And now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election ù As for the two heavy hitters themselves, while both are Hungarian, they couldn t be more different Soros is a billionaire, whose $25 billion fortune is worth about 20 percent of his homeland s entire GDP He was raised in an upper middle class home in Budapest, his father a lawyer and his mother from a wealthy family of silk traders At the age of 17, he left Hungary and migrated to Britain, where he studied at London s School of Economics Ten years later, New York beckoned and, by his late 30s, Soros had founded his own fund management company By contrast, Orban is a country boy Hailing from the rural county of Fejer, where his father worked in agriculture, he studied law in Budapest However, such was his dislike for city life that, upon graduation, he immediately relocated to a country town, Szolnok, and commuted into the capital for work In 1989, he spent a few months at Oxford University, ironically on a Soros scholarship, but quickly returned to Hungary to enter politics Soros once said he hoped that his foundation would help Hungary become a country from which I wouldn t want to emigrate ùIt seems, at the age of 86, his mission to fashion his homeland s politics to his own agenda has failed That said, the majority of Hungarian voters appear to be supportive of Orban s ambition to create an illiberal, nationalist state, within the European Union And there s no doubting how the politician is

And with the new president in Germany standing against confrontation with Russia should we be ready for a policy shift? We ask the former vice president of the OSCE Assembly, and former state secretary to Germany s defense minister Willy Wimmer Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Willy Wimmer, former vice head of OSCE Assembly, and former State Secretary to Germany s Defence Minister, welcome to the show, it s really great to have you with us Now, The Federal election to determine the new Chancellor is coming up in September and Angela Merkel s top contender Martin Schulz has promised to turn the vote into a real thrill , positioning himself as a man of the people With Merkel already under attack for her immigration policies, is Schulz going to destroy her chances for a fourth term? Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September That s an inner German situation There s another situation coming from our West European neighbors We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social democraticparty no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social democraticparty SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse SS:Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War SS:Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President SS:Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality SS:Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population SS:Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment SS:There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems SS:Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt ‚Äì Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough The nation s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign backed NGOs operating in the country The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjart√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijjart√≥, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it s great to have you here on our program, welcome Peter Szijjart√≥:My pleasure, thank you SS:So, we ll start with the latest: † Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros † I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that How dangerous are those organisations for your country? PS:Actually, there s a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country which is a very dangerous approach, because it s not true There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would ve run, so there were no people voting for I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me People vote on politicians, on political parties So it s the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous number one Number two, you know, there s a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it s not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent So, that s why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments then it should be known to the people SS:Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with local groups despite government s opposition PS:What we say is that they have to be transparent People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics then these people have to know, whom these are representing That s what we want to know SS:Well, who are they? PS:We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary He has a very clear, let s say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn t like our approach, doesn t like our policies But, it s not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it s the Hungarian people We find it very anti democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for SS:But when George Soros says that more than ever he s going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he s going to go against the government s will How s that going to play out? PS:He has a very clear intention, that s definitely true, but I think it s an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence This is what we have heard a lot from the U S , for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country So, it s a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors people, persons, businessmen of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves SS:If you re saying you re going after NGOs, you can t just go after Soros funded NGOs, you ll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well Are you ready to do that? PS:My position is that we have to ensure level playing field So, double standards we don t like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by Actually, it s I wouldn t say funny because it s too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter N is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family so, actually, I don t think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non governmental organisation is too much SS:So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country s foreign policy? PS:I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life social, political life of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are SS:But here s a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros funded NGOs, before they came to power so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? PS:Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad in the U S and in the UK But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things SS:Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe do you think with him in the office it s going to be easier for Hungary to get rid of these Soros foundation NGOs in your country? PS:What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points There were very clear attempts from the U S to interfere in our internal issues Just to give you an example, I was given a two page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S as a foreign minister This two pager contained some measures which the U S government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship but, come on! I mean, it s too much, it s interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary Although our economic and defence military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve SS:We re going to talk about U S Hungary relationship in just a bit Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? PS:What I understand from my colleagues, since I don t supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations SS:What s the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? PS:Since I m not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard SS:I spoke to Ex president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus † and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe Why are they still so supportive of this open door policy? What do you think? PS:I wouldn t speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015 I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there s no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there s war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia So, why the EU carries out this open door policy? You should ask the high ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy It s harming the EU, it s dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU we don t even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not † but if you speak like this, you re going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that migration equals terrorism , which you ve never said But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe SS:I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter argument for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested if I m correct a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren t refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it s a homegrown thing PS:It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there s a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are with opening green borders to them, saying please come on in , without controlling them does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been double societies or parallel societies constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies We have to speak about this openly We think that this solution based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it s totally against common sense We have to be able to protect ourselves We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that SS:So let s talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey Luxembourg s Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that Aren t you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? PS:No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary we are a Schengen member state, so if there s a decision that a number of ex migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country number one Number two it s against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they re going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx And, number three, it s breaking European regulations These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling SS:Just because this open door policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr Orban, comes out and says bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide I m thinking, maybe, it s a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a national suicide ? PS:There are tricks in that First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don t oblige So, † these are tricks, and it s very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don t want it SS:You ve turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren t the only one there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls Is this the only way, to put up fences? PS:We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there s a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders according to regulation But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you re located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours it even said, during opening hours ! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia so no Schengen member states There s no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations! then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly So, it s tragic, I ll say SS:Are you pro Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? PS:We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it s a suicide for the European economy European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting sequence and adjusting type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone That s what we have been working on, and that s why we don t like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you re accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming SS:You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe s security, especially Germany is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? PS:Very minimum The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it s not true, because we have border crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country † of course, respecting the regulations When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower Only three countries SS:Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really goes against all European , but he s still willing to take the risk How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? PS:There s a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately Because of European regulations † you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our † perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal SS:I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington do you think Orban s friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary s relations with the EU? PS:I don t think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he s the President of the U S , and I see that there s a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it s not them, it s not liberal Western media, it s not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who s going to be the President of the U S I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him as such a progressive, such a † wonderful, such a smart guy !, but because it s Donald Trump, now he s bashed in every sentence, which I don t think would be fair and correct Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it s American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar † to his position SS:And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti establishment forces, may not win this elections do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? PS:There s a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it s no wonder these are challenging times There s a kind of fight or debate between two camps sovereignists and federalists We say we belong to the sovereignists, of course that European Union can only be strong if the member states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union The only question is how to get there? Our position is that only strong member states can lead to a strong European Union SS:My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy they don t want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S , these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe PS:We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn t want to break the European unity but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well SS:Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview Good luck with everything PS:Thank you RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/

"7 Jan, 2017",George Soros‚Äô world is falling apart ‚Äì and he blames everyone but himself,"George Soros, the Hungarian born billionaire who has meddled in politics across Europe and North America for decades, is angry The world he campaigned for is falling apart, and now he s busy looking for leaders to indict Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv According toSoros, liberal democracy is failing all across the western world Apparently, this is because what he calls the open society ù is in crisis Now, he may very well be right about this, but pinning it on Angela Merkel seems somewhat bizarre Especially when she is painted as being inadvertently in league with Vladimir Putin But, nevertheless, it s the German chancellor he regards as most culpable for why voters have become disenchanted with modern democracy Writing in a widely published New Year op ed, Soros traces the current European crisis back to the crash of 2008 He laments how Germany emerged as the hegemonic power in Europe, but it failed to live up to the obligations that successful hegemons must fulfill, namely looking beyond their narrow self interest to the interests of the people who depend on them ù Then he harks back to the 1940 s Compare the behavior of the US after WWII with Germany s behavior after the Crash of 2008, ù he observes The US launched the Marshall Plan, which led to the development of the EU; Germany imposed an austerity program that served its narrow self interest ù Russophrenia: Western elites ignore their own citizens anger and blame Russia instead (Op Edge by@27khv)https://tdotco /h5UohS2ceE This is very unfair to Berlin The difference here is that the Marshall Plan followed the most destructive war humanity has ever known, and the US was not practicing pure benevolence either It was acting in naked self interest, because it feared all of Europe turning communist And despite Marxist Moscow helping to win the conflict, it was abundantly clear that the USSR and the US would compete for global domination in the new world order of the time Thus, the US was creating a buffer zone against the Soviets and bolstering allies it would need for its own protection, and for the maintenance of the capitalist system it promoted Germany s situation in 2008 was rather different Berlin was not seeking to become a global superpower, and the public was not pushing for it either Also, there was no ideology in play, other than a belief that countries should live within their means Furthermore, Germany had recently completed a costly reunification, and its economy was only returning to growth after a decade of near stagnation For the average German in 2008, the last thing on their mind was becoming Europe s hegemonic power Soros attack on Germany is probably borne out of personal frustration over Merkel s lack of willingness to push for further European integration Yet, this policy is merely a reflection of what her electorate wants Miserly Germans are unable to countenance financially supporting profligate southern Europeans As a result, the Euro currency project, which Merkel s predecessor Helmut Kohl was basically forced into by France, has always had a questionable long term future Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants #GeorgeSoros(Op Ed by Sam Gerrans)https://tdotco /Kgqh4ICNxGpic twitter com/3HC9l5tljI If we believe Soros back story (and many have questioned it), he pushes liberal democracy for perfectly valid reasons The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler s Germany in 1944, ù he writes Later, of course, this regime was replaced with a totalitarian communist system before he fled Budapest in 1947 In his op ed, Soros tells us that his experiences in Britain and the United States taught him how open societies ù are the only ones which guarantee the safety of their people Indeed, the Hungarian may be right about this However, where he has long failed is in understanding the reasons why some countries are not ready for the kind of liberalism he espouses Let s remember how hechuckedmillions of dollars into pro western movements inUkraine A man born and raised in neighboring Hungary should have been well aware of how divided the country was, and known that his actions could lead to turmoil Especially given that his homeland has a stake in the southwestern part, where Hungarian is often the spoken language Yet, he ploughed ahead, and his actions helped to destroy the country The billionaire now says the only explanation I can find (for the electorate s rejection of globalization/liberalism) is that elected leaders failed to meet voters legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy ù Yes, this is really George Soros writing The same George Soros who attends Davos every year Because, if you were looking for a symbol of where the elites and the plebs most diverge, it would probably be at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain commune Where the rulers of the world look down on us mere mortals from the highest town in Europe (at 1,560 meters) Davos is the problem, not the solution (Op Edge by@NeilClark66)https://tdotco /bwKAWPhSx5pic twitter com/49L7oGSMKq But Soros then decides to pin a large part of the blame on a figure who has never been much of a cheerleader for Davos Merkel And he goes on to predict the demise of the EU itself With economic growth lagging and the refugee crisis out of control, the EU is on the verge of breakdown and is set to undergo an experience similar to that of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s ù The reason for the EU s impending doom is apparently the 2017 election cycle, where the contests in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France will be key In the latter, the two leading contenders [Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon] are close to Putin and eager to appease him, ù according to Soros French people sacrifice their own interests to help Putin win the world? (Op Edge by@27khv)https://tdotco /qctrsI5Dtn So, now we are finally on to Putin Soros feels that if either Le Pen or Fillon wins, Putin s dominance of Europe will become a fait accompli ù He writes: I am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of open society ù This is because Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about ù Put plainly, the notion that Putin somehow engineered the French election to organize a contest between Fillon and Le Pen (which is still not guaranteed) is preposterous But this is the trauma filled world Soros now inhabits And he goes on to make another ridiculous statement: In a brilliant move, he [Putin] exploited social media companies business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies That is how he helped Trump get elected ù In other words, Soros thinks Putin manipulated Facebook and Twitter to win the US election for Trump This argument is ridiculous and makes Soros look stupid It also suggests that he s throwing his rattle out of the pram because a few democratic decisions have gone against him And he needs to denigrate Merkel and use Putin as a bogeyman in order to deflect any mud from himself But lets look at the reality here Soros strongly opposed George W Bush s presidency He funded the Move On project and threwmillionsuponmillionsat thedemocraticparty What this interference did was help remove them from their working class base and transform them into a globalist party, which now seems to win only in coastal metropolitan areas Shorn of a need to fund raise to the same extent as before, leftists used Soros money to focus on identity politics , which alienates the white working class And that same blue collar group voted overwhelmingly for Trump this fall For his own part, Soros, ironically at Davos,predictedthat Trump had no chance of being elected president And he was wrong Now it appears he can t deal with the outcome Perhaps because he feels his life s work is slipping away The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/372921-soros-eu-democracy-putin-merkel/

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia If there were a hero of the year list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian led airstrikes One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself a decision that also took out the approaching enemy John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko s single act of heroism when he wrote: I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism –£ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥ –ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–æ–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å –Ω–∞ —Å–µ —è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞https://tdotco /vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that NATO does not seek confrontation, and that it is everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race, the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever closer to Russia s borders However, as Pepe Escobarexplained, The real measure ù is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018 This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s Putin emphasized that NATO s inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to respond adequately to any threat to its national interests On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, Jamala (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision s rules Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors: The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!, Clark concluded via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is, In God We Trust Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as The Satanic Temple (TST) Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics, Thranholm wrote TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000 One of the group s objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan ù Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ù,according to a promotional video Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from God Country : Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US led countries continued with their regime change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from † war torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe s welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants, that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros plan will reap positive benefits via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the forced migration caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it: If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states, Gerrans concluded The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber if not outright disastrous outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance Following news that Germany s Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded: Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign No more In a highly controversial move, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19 year old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony Let s deal with some facts here, Cunningham continued Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years So much then for claims of Russian state sponsored doping ù Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance enhancing drug only in January of this year In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances The US anti doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add insult to injury As Bryan MacDonaldexplained: Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency The reader will be able to discern the line of reasoning in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone: Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes ù In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov s murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs, Whitmore tells us So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime It could also turn out to be a harbinger ù As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump s landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back door machinations Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania The idea didn t seem so wild at the time for a Clinton coup as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306 232), he failed to win the popular vote reportedly by 2 5 million votes Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton in similar fashion to George W Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court could steal the White House from Trump This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes, Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle of so called faithless electors tipping this contest in Clinton s favor Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton an unlikely yet possible scenario Trump went on to formally secure the vote and the presidency on December 19

earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence ù that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved ù in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta ù against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still ongoing hacking operations from the air Goodbye 2016!

"19 Dec, 2016",POTUS-picking: Electoral College under intense focus in controversial election year,"The 538 select Americans that will gather at state capitols across the US on Monday, who are expected to officially pick Donald Trump as the 45th US president, are now facing calls by Trump s opponents to disregard the election results The arcane and often ceremonial institution has received more attention than usual in this controversial presidential election year, when every election process from closed primaries to recounts has received extra scrutiny The electors are nominated by the political parties in each state and in Washington, DC Each presidential candidate has their own unique set of potential electors in each of the states When Americans voted on November 8, they weren t directly voting for the candidates whose names appeared on the ballot, but rather for an elector to go to the Electoral College on December 19 and vote for their candidate Currently, 306 electors are pledged to vote for Republican President elect Donald Trump and 232 are pledged to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Voting is conducted between 9am and 3pm, with the vote expected to be called shortly before 6 pm There has been much discussion over whether Electoral College members could decline to vote, vote for another candidate, or switch party allegiance after Donald Trump, a Republican candidate who was critically denounced by leading members of his own party throughout the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious There was also the suggestion that Hillary Clinton s remarkable lead of 2 8 million in the popular vote might affect the outcome of the Electoral College vote If Electoral College votes against Trump, US will get worst constitutional crisis in its history (Op Edge)https://tdotco /zXrUFFDmD9pic twitter com/Dg2x7cKlPf There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote according to the results in their states However, 29 states do have laws stating just that Despite that fact, no elector has ever been prosecuted for what is referred to as faithless ù voting Refusal or failure to vote for the candidates for president and vice president appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party which nominated the elector constitutes a resignation from the office of elector, his vote shall not be recorded and the remaining electors shall forthwith fill the vacancy, ùthe Michigan law reads Apart from the state laws, Democrats and others hoping to encourage Republican dissenters to switch their vote or decline to vote have been intensely focused on the Electoral College voters Here are the top three: In a video lasting just two minutes and 23 seconds, a roster of Hollywood actors that includes Martin Sheen, who played a president in the popular TV series West Wing, ùappealed to Republican Electoral College members, asking 37 of them not to vote for President elect Donald Trump Thirty seven is the new magic number, as if 37 of Trump s 306 electors do not vote for him, he would have only 269 electoral votes one short of a majority If that happens, and it is a long shot, and neither Trump nor Clinton receives a majority of the electoral votes then the House of Representatives would decide who becomes president Unite for America, which sponsored the video, appears to be a new Super PAC † a type of independent political action committee that can raise unlimited sums of money, but can t contribute directly to a candidate Although it has yet to send an account of its disbursement to the Federal Elections Commission, early indicators show that the fund is somehow tied to MoveON org, a Soros backed Democratic friendly political fund According toHarvard professor Larry Lessig, there may be as many as 20 members who are least considering not voting for Trump The one member who has gone public is Christopher Suprun of Texas, who has said that, since his announcement, he has received email in support, but also death threats He said he will vote for another Republican because Trump chose to stoke fear and create outrage ù Hillary Clinton Has Grounds To Challenge

in Colorado and Washington State who call themselves the Hamilton Electors will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and cast protest votes for a candidate not named These Hamilton Electors are

Electoral College member Michael Banerian told †RT that he has received hundreds and hundreds of e mails, Facebook messages, and letters to my home about four or five a day, tweets ù And in some messages, unfortunately, there were death wishes and generally angry messages from people who can t accept the results of the US election, ùhe said Earlier, in interviews with the US media, Banerian claimed that he had received death threats saying I m going to put a bullet in the back of your mouth, ùand other ill wishes, such as I hope you die ù or do society a favor and throw yourself in front of a bus ù Texas elector Alex Kim, who also says he has received threats, told the US media that he responds with a simple message: You may all go to hell, and I shall go to Texas ù Clay Pell, a Democrat Electoral College member from Rhode Island, has led the charge with nine other electors, including one † Republican, who say that the election process has been tarnished by Russian interference and are asking for more information before casting their votes on Monday This week, he sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper demanding a briefing The letter has now received 20 signatures We as electors have a narrow role, but nonetheless it s a role in protecting the integrity of the election, ùPell told reporters this week, according to AP During his year end press conference at the White House, President Obama blamed the highest levels of the Russian government for hacking the Democratic National Committee and the emails of its chair, John Podesta Obama said that he had confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin directly about the matter when meeting with him in China in September The US leader reportedly told Moscow to cut it out, ùand apparently, since then, Washington didn t see further tampering of the election process ù However, by then, WikiLeaks had already begun publishing the DNC leaks, Obama added, saying that the media wrote about it every day ù However, the majority of Americans voters said inlast week s pollthat the leaked information that the Obama administration claims came from cyber attacks conducted by Russia had no real effect on the election s outcome ",https://www.rt.com/usa/370702-electoral-college-extreme-focus-trump/
"30 Nov, 2016",Saving Poroshenko?

the local level through civilsociety advocacy, monitoring, and civic activism, ùreads a US State Department funding announcement, published this week on thegrants govwebsite It explains further that the State Department is looking for civilsociety organizations, ùeither non profit or for profit (with some conditions) that will provide proposals to perform a watchdog function and advocate for democratic governance ùin Ukraine The description states the program is aimed at increasing civic activism in Ukraine at a local level and building and training a network of civic activists throughout the country These in turn are to keep watch on the activities of local governments and encourage partnerships between civilsociety and media to communicate important information about local reforms to the public ù The organizations applying for the grant must present a program for their activities, along with a financial plan, by January 17, 2017 They are also required to have ties with thematic or in country partners, entities and relevant stakeholders, including private sector partners and NGOs ùand provide proof of these links or their potential development The description states that applicants are also requested to have demonstrable experience in administering successful, and preferably similar, projects ù It adds that: Projects should have the potential to have an immediate

in the implementation of the program that receives the grant It will, for instance, demand quarterly reports on the program s spending and progress Experts believe that this and other such funding opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko The Ukrainian leader s public approval ratings have plunged recently According toLiga Net, in November Poroshenko s rating drew 14 3 percent of popular support having plummeted to a low of 10 7 percent in summer He is still behind former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections, ù Shlyamin believes He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko s leadership, with his promises to introduce visa free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption proving a failure Under Poroshenko, Ukraine has so far been unable to secure European Union and NATO membership In domestic policy [there have been] also continuous failures, ùShlyamin told RT Russian He believes the current grant is one of the final efforts by US President Barack Obama s administration to maintain US Ukraine relations as they have been since the coup in 2014 Obama will soon leave office Therefore, he needs to have time to allocate the necessary financial resources to continue the current policy and prevent future president Donald Trump from building a new line of cooperation

of the loyalty of those who are entrusted with such projects After all, their goal [is] espionage and site preparation for the implementation of pro American policy, ù he said Experts say that under Obama, Washington has been striving to gain full control over Ukraine a strategically important region due to its location close to Russia Shlyamin noted that in this struggle for Kiev, ù Washington

"9 Nov, 2016",Blame Bernie,"The decision by Sanders to throw his support behind the Clinton campaign after he lost the nomination for the democraticparty candidate may have deprived a third party candidate of the chance to defeat Donald Trump If anything, the 2016 race for the White House has only confirmed that what passes for democracy in the United States is in serious crisis, reflective of a political system that is rotten to the core Donald Trump, confounding all the polls and liberal media by winning the presidential election, has become in essence CEO of an empire which in the early 21st century is no longer sustainable The ever deepening social and economicinjusticethat passes for normality in the US is the foundation upon which the American empire rests, which in concrete terms functions on the back of wars of aggression, proxy wars, and regime change This social and economic injustice at home and projection of imperialism overseas exist in a circular relationship most simply and profoundly explained by Malcolm X in the 1960s when he remarked, You can t understand what s going on in Mississippi if you don t understand what s going on in the Congo ù People are dying or getting sicker because they can t afford their insulin, just so Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk can make outrageous profits pic twitter com/5bpwnR2jJ2 And it is precisely here where the mass movement that Bernie Sandersinspiredoffered so much potential to transform the lives of the millions of ordinary Americans of all races, ethnicity, and religion who have been progressively crushed under the weight of the corporate juggernaut that is the real power in the country In this respect, the decision by Sanders to fold his tent andswing in behindthe Clinton campaign after he lost the nomination for democraticparty candidate under decidedlydubiouscircumstances was as inexplicable as it was disdainful Moreover, how can it be justified when he spent the primaries attacking Hillary Clinton s integrity, record and credibility so passionately and effectively that she was left floundering to stem the rising tide of support his campaign was attracting? Therevelationscontained in the classified emails brought to us courtesy of WikiLeaks merely confirm that Sanders was entirely accurate in his depiction of Hillary Clinton as a paid up servant and champion of Wall Street and other unsavory vested interests, among them the Saudis, Qataris, and George Soros Mrs Clinton didn t Just run against Donald Trump,she ran against Wiki Leaks She ran against Russia She ran against Jim Comey & FBI üò≠üò≠üò≠ Sanders support for Clintonresultedin unprecedented scenes of dissent at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia just after Clinton was announced the party s candidate for president, with the claim that Clinton was selected rather than elected by the DNC resonating beyond the arena to chime with the deep and entrenched cynicism of millions when it comes to Washington Sanders, a man who has sat as an independent in the US Senate for over three decades, represented the hopes and determination of the disadvantaged, dispossessed, and excluded people for whom the American dream has under the status quo manifested in their lives as a nightmare of real and authentic change This is the DNC s fault Michigan and Wisconsin are deciding the vote, states Bernie won The DNC is at fault for rigging the primary This is where the option of standing as a third party candidate was open to him Yes, he said that if he lost the nomination to Clinton that he would not stand as an independent But this was self indulgence writ large given the previously mentioned mass movement that had coalesced around him in the course of the democraticparty primaries Jill Stein of the Green Party evenextended a callfor him to lead a Green Party ticket, willing to make way for Bernie as the presidential candidate while she would stand as his putative vice president The broader point to the lack of a viable third party in this election is that it reveals the desperate need for one in order to break the Republican and democraticparty duopoly Both parties are funded by and represent corporate and vested interests, regardless of the claims or rhetoric to the contrary, and neither can honestly claim to champion the needs and interests of the by now well documented 99 percent denied a place at the banquet of American democracy or indeed plutocracy, as has increasingly been the case over the last three decades of unparalleled wealth enjoyed by the one percent on the backs of the poor Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote There is no arguing the potential support for a third party in American politics A recent Gallup pollrevealedthat 57 percent of Americans believe there is a need for a third party in the US political mainstream, which tallies with a trend going back a number of years The question of why a third party has never successfully emerged, then, despite many attempts throughout the years to establish one, is less to do with public support for one and more to do with the lack of the subjective factor in the form of leaders such as Bernie Sanders who are serious about confronting the corporate beast that controls every facet of American life, including the political system As US journalist and broadcaster Chris Hedges writes, Hope is a word that is applicable only to those who grasp reality, however bleak, and do something meaningful to fight back Hope involves fighting against the real forces of destruction, not chanting Yes We Can! in rallies orchestrated by marketing experts, television crews, pollsters, and propagandists, or begging Obama to be Obama Hope, in the hands of realists, spreads fear into the black heart of the corporate elite ù Bernie Sanders, for an all too brief few months over the summer, was a rallying figure for precisely this kind of hope, offering the potential for a national mass movement demanding the transformational change millions of Americans have long been crying out for Today, there is good reason to feel bitterly disappointed in his decision to give in to the democraticparty machine so easily and abjectly The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/366060-blame-bernie-john-wight/
"6 Nov, 2016","Madeleine Albright, latest pro-Clinton Neocon hawking anti-Russia conspiracy theories","Show me an American Neocon today and I will show you a pro Clinton supporter In fact, it is indicative of Hillary Clinton s particular brand of foreign policy that Republican hawks have fled the GOP standard to join ranks with the warmongering Democrats Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In order to guarantee another 4 8 years of US led military aggression in the Middle East, and heightened tensions with Russia and China (all of which translates into lucrative defense spending), the Neocons have found it necessary to drag Russian President Vladimir Putin into the 2016 presidential race as a means of deflecting attention away from a devastating series ofleaked emails, courtesy of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, that portray Clinton and her campaign team in less than glowing terms The latest Neocon to grease the wheels of Clinton s War & Wall Street political machine is Madeleine Albright, 79, the former US Secretary of State, who is perhaps most famous for two quotes, What s the point of having this superb military if we can t use it? And second, when asked in a 1996 interview with the news program 60 Minutes if the price of UN sanctions against Iraq which was half a million dead Iraqi children was worth it, Albright unhesitatingly responded, We think the price is worth it Albrightopenedher opinion piece in USA Today with a wicked curve ball: Democrats have been renewing their call this week for the FBI to release more information on the connections among Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government But it is already clear that Russia s intervention in our election on Trump s side is the real scandal of 2016 Albright attempts to control the narrative, not to mention the history books, by instructing the reader that Russia s (unproven) intervention in the 2016 presidential election is the real scandal of the year, as opposed, of course, to Julian Assange s torturous, slow drip outing of Hillary Clinton and her mind boggling list of poor decision making The Russian government has already hacked into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an effort to create confusion and turn voters off from politics, Albright wrote, essentially telling Americans nothing to look at here, please move on Nowhere does Albright question the contents of the emails This deliberate and glaring oversight explains why Albright and her fellow Neocons found it so necessary to drag Russia into this scandal The allegations contained in the WikiLeaks emails are so potentially damaging to Clinton s chances at the White House that they required a diversion as large as Russia to conceal them Yet, even the FBIadmitsthere is no convincing evidence linking the leaked emails as an effort by Russia to boost Trump s victory chances on Nov 8th And judging by the tarnished reputations of the Republican and Democratic contenders, it should come as no surprise that Russia has no clear favorite in this American dog race, which make the hacking charges against Moscow all the more ridiculous But all this misses the main point, indeed as it is cunningly designed to do With all of the spin going on, can anybody still recall what the released Clinton emails revealed? Briefly, the leaked documentsrevealedthat the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had colluded with the Clinton campaign to ensure Hillary Clinton received the nomination ahead of other potential candidates, including the popular Bernie Sanders That damning revelation led to the ouster of DNC †chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Russians clearly had nothing to do with that Second, the woman who replaced Schultz, Democratic strategist and former CNN contributor, Donna Brazile, was found to havetipped offthe Clinton campaign on the content of two questions ahead of the final Clinton Trump CNN hosted debate The jaw dropping implications of that explosive finding, which could have tipped the scales in favor of Clinton, deserves nothing short of a Watergate style investigation By the way, the Russians had nothing to do with that bit of insider intrigue, either But that s mere child s play compared to documents that show how Clinton, as the Secretary of State, severely mishandled the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was orchestrated by a radical Islamic group US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack In an interview with Democracy Now, AssangesaidClinton was even responsible for arming Islamic State fighters in Syria in an apparent effort to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad Clinton s leaky emails point to the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of †ISIS †of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including †ISIS, that s there in those emails, the WikiLeaks co founder said There s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone, he added Nor did the Russians have anything to do with those decisions made by the Obama administration So why all the mindless media chatter about Russia? There was yet another potential bit of collateral damage in the ongoing WikiLeaks drama that has largely gone overlooked Since it is preposterous to think that Russia would have any need or desire to influence the US elections, nor has there been a single piece of convincing evidence to support the claim, WikiLeaks somehow managed to get the leaked documents Why not from a DNC insider? In fact, why not fromSeth Rich, the director of voter expansion with DNC who would have had access to the incriminating emails? We ll probably never know the answer to that question because Mr Rich is no longer around to provide his testimony In the early hours of July 10th, Rich was shot multiple times in the back as he walked home alone from a Washington pub Was Rich the victim of a robbery? If so, investigators were baffled as to why his wallet, credit cards, wrist watch and cellphone were not removed from his body Police Chief Cathy Lanier admitted at a press conference, Right now, we have more questions than answers ù Julian Assange, falling short of admitting Rich as opposed to Russia was the source of the leaked information, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the premature death of Mr Rich ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich Neverthless, Newsweek was just one of many media outlets thatbrushed offthe incident as yet another round of Clinton conspiracy theories, this one claiming that Rich was murdered îat dawn îas he was on his way to sing to the FBI about damning internal DNC emails Funny how the Western media regularly accuses foreign media of jumping on wild conspiracy theories, yet they have no qualms saddling up their own highly dubious ideas about Russian involvement in the WikiLeaks Although it may be perfectly true that Mr Rich died the victim of a robbery gone awry, there are still grounds to believe that he was the DNC whistleblower Somehow the mainstream media, however, found it more expedient to pin the blame on a distant foreign power without a shred of evidence Indeed, Newsweek was apparently satisfied that it had performed due diligence by quoting an anonymous source that said: There was no indication that any insider was involved in this Every indication is this was a remote attack from a foreign government îthe Russians When Donald Trump first announced he would scale back the size of America s global military footprint if elected president, neo conservatives unleashed a collective howl of pain as they began fleeing en masse the ship of the Republican Party Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a top Neocon ideologue, signaled the defection when hesaida Trump presidency would herald in a new age of American style fascism Today, the tattered flag of the Neocons is flapping high above the Clinton camp, distant fires glowing, as they continue to spearhead a scathing attack on Trump just days before the election What is the source for this great defection against their own party? Quite simply, the Neocons have no allegiance except to individuals like George W Bush and, yes, Barack Obama who pledge to continue America s wars of expansion and empire Clinton s past record in Iraq, Libya and Syria strongly suggests she will lead the Neocons to more foreign pillage and plunder; Trump has pledged to bring home the troops in order to Make America Great Again Neocons are not big fans of infrastructure projects, like filling potholes and rebuilding schools Trump alienated the Republican warhorses when he pledged to pursue, like a real disciple of the conservative political creed, a foreign policy that does not send American men and women off to distant battlefields to be killed and maimed in senseless military adventures Assange òsorry for Clinton as a personality (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films)https://t co/6Yw748WCnbpic twitter com/Abf0VFg6zy The followingpassageby Joseph A Mussomeli in the Washington Post, of all places really nailed it as to why the Neocons hate Donald Trump: Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts, unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb Bashar al Assad in Syria, are frightened But what really troubles them is [Trump s] generally level headed and unmessianic attitude toward foreign affairs †Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep s clothing î just as on some foreign policy issues Trump is little more than Bernie Sanders in wolf s clothing Anne Applebaum, perennial anti Russia scaremonger and notable Neocon,tosseda smoke grenade into the WikiLeaks scandal, attempting to obfuscate Julian Assange s work with groundless accusations: Russia will continue to distribute and publish the material its hackers have already obtained from attacks on the Democratic National Committee, George Soros s Open Society Foundation, former NATO supreme commander Gen Philip Breedlove †and probably others The point will be to discredit not just Hillary Clinton but also the U S democratic process and, again, the elite ù who supposedly run it Applebaum wants the distracted public to forget that the leaks already discredited Clinton Moreover, the lesson between the lines of Applebaum s diatribe is that all the bad things Clinton has been connected with should be forgiven and forgotten because, well, big bad Russia allegedly had a hand in the mess Albright claimed that Russia seeks to undermine Western leaders by making them seem corrupt or malicious The reader may discern, based on what we already know about some Western leaders from Mr Assange, the value of that statement for themselves So in closing, here we have the very same individuals that cheered when former Secretary of State Colin Powellshooka vial of fake anthrax in the UN General Assembly, spooking the world into believing Saddam Hussein was sitting on a hoard of WMDs, thereby triggering war against a sovereign state that has killed over 1 million Iraqis and counting, now would like us to believe Russia is behind the WiliLeaks emails that threaten to sink Clinton s rat infested ship once and for all We would be fools to let them get away with such deliberate deception again @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/365545-madeleine-albright-clinton-neocon/

If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro western reformers ùand pro Russian kleptocrats ùThis is hogwash The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov) What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power And for the past two years, they ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory Something even America s influential Foreign Policy journal nowadmits There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West Furthermore, he s enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal That said, Poroshenko is described as pro Europe and his predecessor as pro Russia However, in reality, both men are pro themselves and pro money Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems The central Asians with the exception of Kazakhstan have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago Let s just look at Ukraine s figures In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller in real terms than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now To add insult to injury, it is also the world s mostunequal country When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet s most extensive rail systems A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world s largest plane, the An 225 This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now With that in mind, you d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of Marshall Plan to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming Because they know the funds would be stolen Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States ùThus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine s economic collapse is the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor ù In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal, ùPetro recently wrote However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev You see, Ukraine doesn t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia Except it s not Slovakia s gas, because that country doesn t have any of its own Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium Ukraine s completely insane economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs pic twitter com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn t want to admit that it s Russian gas This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an independence day ùmilitary parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all Aside from all this, what Poroshenko s regime can t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is Currently, it s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world If Back to the Future s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again, how many would jump right in?

African Americans, Latinos, and young people by trying to overturn certain voter legislation, with the help of billionaire George Soros Marc Elias, described by theWashington Post(WAPO) as a Democratic superlawyer, ùhas been bringing a number of cases to battleground states where Republicans have tweaked laws to supposedly work in their favor For the 2016 election, 15 states introduced new voting restrictions, ranging from strict photo ID requirements to early and same day voting limits UPDATE: Now 15 states with new voting restrictions in place for 1st time in a prez election:https://tdotco /w2gSuIFCGqpic twitter com/qWAyNbRbwH At the same time, however, both Democrats and Republicans continue tooppose lawsthat could reform the system and open it up to more independents and candidates from other parties Elias, who rose to prominence in 2008 representing Minnesota Senator Al Franken in a recount which lasted eight months, approached Soros with proposals to challenge voting restrictions in states around the country, WAPO reports You can bet your very last dollar that George Soros is not in the least concerned with justice or equality This https://tdotco /g161KqKbIt The pro Democrat Soros invested $5 million to protect the party s diverse ùrange of voters, according to WAPO While various civil rights groups have been challenging laws across the country, some of which Elias has joined, he has also brought cases in Ohio, Arizona, Virginia, Wisconsin and North Carolina, and a challenge in Phoenix in September We re challenging the laws in the states in which we have the greatest concern, ùhe said, adding that he doesn t think people should think we re done filing lawsuits for this election cycle ù 8 million Latino voters are

we all strive to do, ùhe is, as his firm s client choice would reflect, largely targeting states which will help bolster the democraticparty vote Thanks!https://tdotco /o7Hkbqbgv4 For those43 percentof Americans who do not align themselves with the two leading parties, their alternatives are extremely limited thanks to long standing legislation that restricts ballot access for Libertarian, Green, independents, and other third parties ù @RyJamesG@DanRiehldon t worry George Soros is probably already directing his army of lawyers to file suits to get him on state ballots Numerous states have laws in place which favor Democrats and Republicans such as Pennsylvania where, based on a 1971 statute, candidates must collect between 20,000 and 70,000 signatures to gain access to the ballot, compared to just 2,000 needed for Democrats and Republicans Similarly, Florida requires an independent presidential candidate to have 110,000 signatures by early July to ensure they re on the ballot for the November election FairVotenotes that Texas has some of toughest laws against third parties, where independents must gather signatures equal to 1 percent of the turnout in the previous presidential contest Voting restrictions disenfranchise people of color, the poor, young people & the disabled These laws are modern day poll taxes #VRAChat Not only are superlawyers ùsuch as Elias not working to change these undemocratic ùrequirements, but the party has actively opposed those candidates for years Following their loss ùin the 2000 campaign, the democraticparty lodged 29 complaints in 19 states against Green Party nominee Ralph Nader during the 2004 campaign, all aiming to have him removed from the ballot In Pennsylvania, it was successfully argued in court that more than 30,000 signatures on his nomination papers should be scrapped on such technicalities as using a nickname such as Bill instead of the formal name William, accordingto Oliver Hall, Nader s attorney In July, a federal court ruled that the number of signatures needed by third party candidates to make it onto the ballot in the Keystone State be reduced from 21,000 to 5,000, which the Libertarians, Greens and Constitution Party were able toachieve Smaller parties can also get stuck with expensive legal bills if challenges against them are successful, such as the case with Nader in 2004 who had to pay off almost $82,000 without the help of billionaire donors such as Soros Nader thus became the first candidate in American history to be penalized financially by a state for attempting to run for public office, ùHall says A similar fate befell the Pennsylvania Green Party in 2006 when Carl Romanelli ran for the US Senate Needing 67,000 signatures, he gathered more than 100,000, only to be successfully challenged and left with an $89,000 legal bill It s a frustrating process repeated almost every election cycle, since parties often need to achieve a certain percentage of the vote to remain on the ballot for the next time, something the Green Party has shadowing over them inTexas Ballot access isn t the only barrier preventing independents and third party candidates from making an impact in the presidential election Most states distribute their electoral votes on a winner take all basis, making it nearly impossible for smaller parties to garner support when the major two have so much influence and support After the 2013 Shelby ruling, new discriminatory voting laws immediately passed We can t stay silent #VRAchatpic twitter com/nQEiTiyiku Efforts to counter the spoiler

"22 Jul, 2016",Welcome to the circus of US political conventions,"Annual party convention season in the United States combines comedy, farce, and melodrama in one rip roaring package of unadulterated entertainment that is to democracy what the Emperor Nero was to fire prevention The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard waving, holler whooping people bused in from every town in the country Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy eyed patriot boasts In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was Lock her up! Lock her up! ùwith all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house Trump promises to Make America Great Again, ùa sufficiently open ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean Given the billionaire s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and isless than enthusiastic about NATO This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, thegloatingover the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America s way be described as progressive Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have someinteresting friends and supporters Wall Street and George Soros prime among them who aren t exactly struggling to get by Then, too, the sympathy she s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill s notoriouscrime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end It is a two term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years?

Jerome White:She has a long record, as did her husband Bill Clinton with very, very close connections to the most powerful financial institutions in the US on Wall Street Under her husband s administration they deregulated Wall Street; they lifted the Glass Steagall Act, and allowed the immense building up of the financial bubble that produced the financial collapse of 2008 As the Obama administration carried out the bailout of Wall Street, the Clintons maintained very, very close ties As we all know, she received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fact millions of dollars and speaking fees in the aftermath of the crash RT:Clinton is also likely to get more contributions now that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have dropped out of the race Will this have an impact on her stances on issues and, perhaps, presidency? JW:After an entire primary process in which for the first the anger of millions of workers over the social inequality, over the domination of the entire political system by the financial elites was expressed In the end essentially, what the American people have is a choice between two equally right wing candidates, two pro war candidates On the one hand, a billionaire, who is Donald Trump, who seeks to tap into the social anxiety and channel it along xenophobic and anti immigrant lines; on the other, complete tool of Wall Street and of the Pentagon In the end, the [Bernie] Sanders campaign, which tapped into this enormous anger he is now committed to support Hillary Clinton, who he openly criticizes as a tool of Wall Street But he as a Democrat now is supporting that very same tool of Wall Street RT:The fact she is supported by big corporations doesn t seem to be harming Clinton s ratings Don t people care about this?

Although many people are skeptical about the circumstances behind Trump s phenomenal rise, the tycoon (Trumps says he s worth $8 7 billion, Forbes puts it at $4 1, a difference that probably means something among the ultra wealthy), manages to sell himself as a successful businessman who will, at the same time, work on behalf of average American workers One of his regular claims aside from promising to make the Mexican government pay for a wall on the US border is to stop US factory jobs from going to India, China and Mexico Annoying pledges like that, which would cut deeply into Corporate America s bottom line, goes far at explaining why the elite loath him and your average mortal adores him Although it is a delicious sight watching America s movers and shakers tremble at the mere mention of Trump s name, it nevertheless speaks volumes about the condition of US democracy that Americans had to wait for a rich, charismatic real estate developer to come along and save them from the cold hearted wretchedness of the dual party, borderline fascist system Imagine what the US would look like without the arrival of these rare, mega wealthy mavericks who were born with a compassion gene for ordinary folks The Establishment would continue unmolested with its too big to jail banker bailouts,overseas military misadventuresand the dangerous consolidation ofcorporate power Trump s ability to speak freely on the issues without any concern for breaking the bank is exactly how an honest political system should be organized Indeed, how many US politicians today, as the US information war against Russia resembles something out of Tom Clancy thriller, would admit they d work with the Kremlin to resolve global problems? No politician should be wary of discussing a controversial subject that is dear to the heart of the electorate for fear of chasing away campaign donors Case in point: The immigrant crisis, which the Obama administration arrogantly ignored at great peril This polarizing issue largely explains Trump s huge popularity among voters today The specter of Mexican immigrants flooding the country and with the full blessing of Washington, not to mention the Vatican (Trump is certainly the first politician in history to havetraded barbswith the Bishop of Rome on the campaign trail) may go down in the history books as the proverbial straw that finally broke the Establishment s back In any case, it will certainly go down as the issue that launched Trump s political career and, quite possibly, destroyed the Republican Party as we know it Amazing comments from the Pope considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls pic twitter com/g3iVLDVGe5 Americans may had to bite their tongues as they got screwed over in the 2008 Financial Crisis, and maintained their pharmaceutically induced composure as Obama proved to be every bit of a warmongering president as his Neocon predecessor But let s face it: no American homeowner is going to keep quiet while their neighborhood isinvadedby illegal aliens Indeed, American streets are already respectable crime zones in their own right, we certainly don t need any help from illegal aliens, thank you very much Now before somebody screams Hitler! in this political theater of the absurd, let s put the situation into its proper context: At the very same time US companies are exporting thousands of good paying factory jobs south of the border, Mexico is exporting not much more to America than its social riff raff According to governmentfigures, US corporations employed 1,106,700 Mexicans (on Mexican soil) in 2012 (the latest year tallied), but Mexican companies employed just 68,800 in the United States that year So Trump seems to have some leverage when he says Mexico should foot the bill tobuild a wallon the US Mexican border But the crazy is just beginning Once north of the Rio Grande, the fence hoppers voluntarily turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents, who then proceed to give the Mexicans a Coke and a smile before telling them to have a nice day and please don t forget to show up for your scheduled court appearance FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Next, newly downsized Joe Trailer Park is called upon to fund bus tickets for the uninvited Mexicans to travel to the US city of their choosing Only the government could script such a narrative But wait, it gets better! What about the promise the illegals made to appear in court, thus becoming patriotic, flag saluting, Americans? Sorry, no time for formalities! Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol CounciltoldBreitbart that approximately 95 percent of the illegal immigrants never return as promised for court proceedings The majority of these people crossed the border illegally and were then dropped off here at the bus station, so they could continue to their final destination, and that destination is an American city near you, ùsaid Garza This right here is border insecurity at its best Our border is not patrolled our federal government is releasing thousands and thousands of illegal aliens into our communities ù If there was a better way of conjuring up the bygone spirits of nationalistic right wing parties, I really can t imagine it And since the entire notion of strong national borders has somehow morphed into political correct speak for racism , these people are not sent scurrying back to where they came from No, sending a message to other would be trespassers would be too logical, and logic took a backseat in the American Trailblazer a long time ago Trump spopularity, however, cannot be only explained by the specter of porous borders with Mexico After all, America s great disillusionment with its political system has been steadily intensifying, and all the more once it became painfully obvious that the hope and change that Barack Obama had promised was just more smoke and mirrors Drew Weston, in a devastating 2011essayin the New York Times, summed up Obama s failure to put the country on the right track after being derailed by George W Bush s reckless 8 year war on terror Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it He never explained that decision to the public ù A bit later, Weston wrote: Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn t seem to be All Americans knew is that they re still unemployed, they re still worried about how they re going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can t get a job ù Here is my personal reason for supporting Trump Aside from his inspiring message of securing America s border, ending US military adventures and reinvigorating the US economy, a Trump presidency will halt America s slide towards family dynasties ruling the country like hereditary monarchies Consider: If Hillary Clinton wins thepresidencyin 2016, and assuming she is reelected for a second term in 2020, the American people will have been ruled since 1989 by two Bushes and two Clintons (for a total of 28 years out of 36, with a non consequential 8 year intermission by America s first black president) Barbara Bush, the wife of an ex president and mother of another,expressedher lack of enthusiasm for yet another Bush entering the White House (although for the record it must be noted that she was speaking about Jeb, not the shiniest apple on the Bush family tree) I think this is a  great country and if we can t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that s silly, ùshe told C Span early last year I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes there are just more families than that ù But is America ready for aTrump Dynasty? Judging by the escapades of the powerful Democratic and Republican Establishment, which is pulling out all the stops to dump Trump, the charismatic, billionaire real estate developer probably stands a worse chance of winning the keys to the White House mansion than Justin Bieber There s simply no way the Washington elite will willingly release their grip on the most powerful office in the world, even if such a thing would mean restoring some of America s former shine @Robert_Bridge Bridge is the author of the book,Midnight in the American Empire, which discusses the dire consequences of extreme corporate power in the US The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336986-trump-establishment-us-elections/
"21 Mar, 2016",Brazil's revolution starting to reveal its true colors,"As we approach High Noon in the savage Brazilian politico economic western, here s what is at stake following my previous piece on RT For the past five days, all hell has broken loose Itstartedwith judge Sergio Moro, the tropical Elliott Ness at the head of the two year old, 24 phase Car Wash corruption investigation, crudely manipulating an illegal phone tapping of a Lula Dilma Rousseff conversation, which he duly leaked to corporate media and was instantly used as proof ùthat Lula may be back in power as Chief of Staff because he s afraid ùof Elliott Ness As a crucial instance of the total information war currently at play in Brazil with the hegemonic Globo media empire and the major newspapers salivating for a white coup/regime change more than ever the shaky proof ùturbocharged the Rousseff impeachment drive to a whole new level The appalling politicization of the Brazilian Judiciary is now a fait accompli, with many a judge moved by opportunism and/or corporate interest/shady political agendas That implies a normalization ùof illegal procedures such as phone tapping of defense lawyers and even the President (Edward Snowden, in a lightweight aside, commented that Rousseff is still not using cryptography in her communications) Supreme Court ministers at least so far have not punished Elliott Ness for his illegal tapping of the President s phone and for his illegal leaking of the Lula Rousseff conversation (there s nothing in it to implicate them in any wrongdoing, as Elliott Ness himself admitted) The next cliffhanger was Supreme Court minister Gilmar Mendes a notorious opposition puppet using the illegal phone tapping to suspend Lula s new role; that was required ùfrom him by two opposition parties Lula back in government means two anathemas for the white coup/regime change crowd; political articulation which may end up by defeating the impeachment drive against Rousseff; and fundamental help for the Rousseff administration to start at least taming the economic crisis It s crucial to note that Mendes s unilateral decision was taken only a day and a half after he had a long lunch with two opposition heavyweights, one of them Wall Street darling banker and former Soros prot√©g√© Arminio Fraga Mendes not only pushed the administration into a corner; he went further, handing back to Elliott Ness the competence to investigate Lula under Car Wash, and this after Moro himself had already been forced, by law, to transfer the jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, as Lula was to become a minister Mendes was not competent to do it as even other Supreme Court judges stressed; he took it away from the minister speaker of Car Wash in the Supreme Court, Teori Zavascki So now it s up to Zavascki to affirm his competence ùin the matter Essentially the phone tapping leak is crammed with serious illegalities, as a smatter of jurists has pointed out; from the tapping taking place after Moro himself determined they should be discontinued, to the leak of a Presidential communication, which could only be authorized by the Supreme Court Which leads us to the hidden political agenda behind the leak: to expose Lula to public execration and pit him against politicians and the Judiciary Lula has presented a habeas corpus request to the Supreme Court, signed by some of Brazil s top jurists, while the government is about to present its own appeal against the blocking of Lula s nomination The ball is with the Supreme Court and all bets are off The Brazilian Supreme Court in fact has ceased to act as a Supreme Arbiter as some of its members refuse to admit all the current trappings of a police state This is happening while a rash of prosecutors and a gaggle of investigators at the Brazilian Federal Police the equivalent of the FBI now can be identified as mere pawns of the ultra politicized Car Wash investigation In a nutshell: Justice ù in Brazil is now totally politicized And Car Wash s mandate is now revealed to clearly consist in the outright criminalization of absolutely anything related to the coalition governments led by the Workers Party since the beginning of the first Lula term in 2003 Car Wash is not about the cleansing of corruption in Brazilian politics; if that really was the target, top opposition politicians would be under investigation, and many behind bars already Moreover, the appalling corruption scheme in the development of Sao Paulo s metro lines would not have been treated only as the working of a cartel of companies, with no politicians involved; the Sao Paulo metro racket follows the same logic of the corruption scheme discovered by the NSA inside Petrobras Rule of law ùin Brazil has now been debased to Turkey s Sultan Erdogan levels featuring business leaders with the wrong ùpolitical connections arrested for months without trial, which translates as blatant manipulation of public opinion, the preferred tactic of Mani Pulite fan Moro and his team The road map ahead is grim The Brazilian Constitution is being torn to shreds, submitted to a white coup logic to be enforced by all means necessary The politicization of the Judiciary runs in parallel to the mainstream media spectacularization of everything that the process touches, criminalizing politics but only selected politicians Brazil s hugely concentrated economic interests are willing to support any deal that would mean an endgame to the political/judicial war, as politico economically the country remains totally paralyzed and polarized Inside the immensely corrupt Brazilian Congress, a special commission to deliberate over Rousseff s impeachment has been appointed, including 36 dodgy members of Parliament who are facing myriad judicial problems; Kafka or the Dadaists would not come up with anything as absurd So the road map ahead now depends on how this dodgy impeachment commission will progress or not One of the possible scenarios is Rousseff s ouster as early as late April, even if she has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing; the usual Empire of Chaos suspects and the local comprador elites barely contain their glee as they inform ùBloomberg or the Wall Street Journal But then there s the Lula factor Assuming Lula may be back in action in the next few days, extensive political articulation which the opposition wants to kill by all means will need 171 votes to smash the impeachment drive in the lower house; only then may the administration defuse the political crisis to seriously tackle the economic crisis In a cliffhanger heavy, extremely fluid scenario, there would be only two possible negotiated solutions: a sort of legal ersatz Parliamentarism, with Rousseff still as President, and Lula as a de facto Prime Minister; and an all out ersatz Parliamentarism, with Lula in charge of all the government s political articulations A pact forged during secret ùdinners in Brasilia between the PSDB (the former social democrats turned neoliberal enforcers) and the PMDB party (the other major cog in the Workers Party ruling coalition) has been sealed to kill both options The PMDB, incidentally, is notorious for what else corrupt politicians, not as a governing entity All eyes are now on the Supreme Court and the wallowing in corruption Brazilian Congress Lula, in the eye of the hurricane itself, is in the most unenviable position He will need to use all his political capital and all his decades as a master negotiator to find a (political compromise) way out The Brazilian street remains totally radicalized; the logic (?) of blind hate prevails while virtually all instances of juridical or political mediation, not to mention plain, civilized common sense, have been frozen Brazilian democracy one of the healthiest in the world is now being strangled by the warped python logic of a police state Which brings us to the tawdry scenario that might as well play out before summer A cowardly, very conservative CongressexpelsRoussef from power; the Vice President, PMDB s Temer, steps in, the country is pacified ùand the proverbial foreign investors, Wall Street, the Koch brothers in the US, hail the white coup; the Car Wash hysteria slowly and magically fades out because no way former opposition mandarins should be indicted or go to jail (that s only for the Workers Party) Kafka and the Dadaists to the rescue, again; this is exactly the soft ùregime change deal that has been clinched in Brasilia by a nasty combo; selected (corrupt) politicians bought and paid for by the Brazilian comprador elites; selected businessmen; a large part of a co opted Judiciary; and corporate media (ruled by four families) Call it white coup Call it regime change Call it the Brazilian color revolution Without NATO Without humanitarian ùimperialism Without blood and zillions of US dollars lost, like in Iraq, Libya or Syria So clean ù So lawful ù How come Empire of Chaos s theoreticians never thought about this before? Humanitarian ùimperialism is so old Hillary; at least the Masters of the Universe will have a new template to apply all over the developing world Happy regime change days are here again And forget about reading any of this on Western corporate media The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/336440-brazils-revolution-color-escobar/
"5 Mar, 2016","I'm confused, can anyone help me? Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I m confused Very confused Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspotdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspotdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately weaponizing the migration/refugee crisis to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia s intervention in Syria on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011 Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011 so surely it s more accurate to accuse them of weaponising the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government We want people to come back to Syria, hesaidin February Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back, he said, asreportedby Telesur And this is the man who along with Putin we are told is deliberately weaponising migration by the NATO commander? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused very confused in fact by the portrayal of Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton as a progressive who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be the lesser of two evils Now, from what I ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and regime changer whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton s foreign policy record in this 2015article Among Hillary s boasts are that she urged her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia The innocent civilians killed in the illegal humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton urged included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces Four years later, Hillary sided with hard right Republican Party hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS You don t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny We came We saw He died! Last week on George Galloway s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party s Dr Jill Stein told us Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support How does Clinton s record make her progressive ? Or has the word progressive today been redefined to mean an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge fund billionaire GeorgeSoros I m confused Can anyone help me? The EU referendum Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo But I m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for Brexit in June s Referendum We retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for national security and in order todealwith Russian aggression Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support @DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic twitter com/evltbtGyuo We re told a Brexit would shock the world economy And the UK itself wouldbreak up But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn t in the EEC/EU And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of 550m As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: The public finances were also in rude health a borrowing requirement of 1 96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of 600m by the end of 1969 And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969 Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre EEC accession era, but the UK wasn t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv) So our national security clearly didn t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it s a different world today But Norway and Switzerland aren t in the EU and didn t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people Leading bankers City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders Tony Blair They can t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m confused still confused about the ongoing investigation into the MH 17 plane disaster After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong evidence that the plane was shot down by a surface to air missile We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft, said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014 But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators Now if it was so clear cut that rebels supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused about what we ve been told by western political figures about Russia s intervention in Syria When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and moderate Syria opposition forces You have a strong propaganda message that says you re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it,‚ÄùUK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a warning shot for Russia But if Russia hadn t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we ve seen renewed allegations that Russia isn t hitting IS But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January: It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary This is no longer the case How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS s air force Surely IS would be advancing if Russia s campaign was really aiding the group? I m confused Can anyone help me? Finally I m confused about Turkey and British support for democratic values British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a long standing goal for Britain His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an important ally Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan s government is steamrolling over human rights,‚Äùsays Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid: The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated Impunity for human rights abuses persisted The independence of the judiciary was further eroded Now, neocons always tell us that they re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond? Instead of condemning Turkey s undemocratic crackdowns, Hammond tweets about extending sanctions on Russia Agreed at#AmiensFGBon need to keep EU sanctions against Russia until full#Minskagreement implementation#Ukrainepic twitter com/RqAooF4UPV The accessioncriteriafor membership of the EU includes: stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities Why are neocons so keen on Turkey joining the EU when its clear that these conditions are not met?I m confused Can anyone help me?

"26 Feb, 2016","Pentagon update: US, not Russia, responsible for breaking Islamic State","The Pentagon has a lot of money to spend on propaganda But its white washing Russia out of progress in Syria has an increasingly propaganda savvy audience howling, and is a poor use of resources This week, the Pentagon information machine made some pronouncements which saw the light of day in media outlets which includedAOLand theDaily Mail In materially identical pieces, US Army propagandist Colonel Steve Warren fires off several rounds of bullet points to the effect that Islamic State is beginning to crack ùunder the onslaught of air strikes and counter terror measures ù, and that would be jihadis are realising that this caliphate isn t all unicorns and rainbows whatever that means His main bombardment consists of the notion that we have the US to thank for this progress He says: We see them having lost about 40% of the territory that they held at the pinnacle of their strength in Iraq, and they have lost about 10% of the territory they once held in Syria We believe this failure is due to several factors, the first and foremost I believe is the presence of devastating Coalition air power Second is the increasing capability of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq And third is the increasing cohesion, strength and unity of the 65 nation coalition that has come together to defeat Daesh ù The problem with the colonel s presentation from a propaganda point of view is that it is not very good It is too blunt People are more sophisticated than this even people who spend a lot of time on the Daily Mail website Whether you like Putin or not, his decisiveness in Syria was a game changer After years of pretending to chase ISIS, the US was suddenly shown to have been merely simulating activity for entirely different ends Russia, on the other hand, went in to clean house and has worked effectively with the army of Syria to that end Any grown up apportioning of credit which leaves out the key players discredits itself before it begins It s like trying to discuss Gone with the Wind without reference to either Scarlett or Rhett Yet this is Colonel Warren s approach He simply disregards everything which doesn t suit him: the fact that the US led coalition ùhas no legal mandate in Syria; that Assad is the democratically elected head of that country; that the US is engaged in destroying arbitrarily and unilaterally (in fact, if not in name) yet another foreign state which has done it no harm; that finally and emphatically if the resolve of this group of US sponsored terrorists is beginning to crack ù, it is thanks entirely to the efforts of the Syrian Army and the air support provided by the only outside country to have a legitimate role in Syria: Russia #ISISeasy to defeat if#Turkeyand#SaudiArabiadid not support it Assad s adviser to RThttps://tdotco /JY5GJCdSCZpic twitter com/ND8VdtlBrO The colonel has a tough job on his hands Too many people now understand that what is needed for the defeat of so called Islamic State, is for the US government to cease providing it with arms and funding They know that this chameleon like organization only makes any sense when seen as an arm of US Israeli policy; to Balkanise the Middle East and make it easier to control, and to facilitate the theft of their wealth by corporations; its secondary purpose in combination with the efforts of men likeGeorge Soros is to create the blowback needed to justify an invasion of Europe by an army of aggressive, unskilled young men in order to asset strip it, drag it into chaos, and prevent what the US fears most: a new union built around afreer Germany co joined with Russia Agents of US military ambitions such as the CIA have always created media outlets or subverted existing ones as part of propaganda wars against foreign countries But two thorns appeared in the side of this policy in recent years Firstly, in a world connected by the internet, propaganda intended for foreign consumption routinely feeds back into the US arena, thereby falling foul of laws against the use of US tax dollars to conduct informational war against the taxpayers themselves Secondly, again in a world connected by the internet, US citizens are increasingly discovering uncomfortable truths about everything from 9/11 to banking and medical cartels Thus, distrust of government internally is a growing problem for those tasked with managing the population As ForeignPolicy comnotes, the philosophical foundation for the policy of not using US tax dollars to propagandize US citizens was to maintain a distinction between the US and the Soviet Union Happily for those burdened by such concerns, the Soviet Union is no more, and in 2013 the US removed the last fig leaf of pretense that the US government did not engage in propaganda internally This makes everything simpler The war propaganda machine can lump the US citizenry together with everyone else and get on with the job of bringing or keeping everyone on board with whatever the Pentagon s masters wish it to do In a war scenario and the US is almost always making war on someone budgets extend and keep themilitary industrial complexmaking more for its shareholders The guiding principle of those who get the government contracts which collectively make wars happen is to ensure that the last penny gets spent so that the same amount or preferably more will be forthcoming in the next financial period The US military, then, is a huge state run business in the form of a bureaucratic and accounting machine tasked with blowing things up as a function of securing funding It manages to kill a lot of people, but it is a blunt if heavy instrument It was described to me by a friend then himself serving in US Army Intelligence as the Post Office with bombs ù Like any large organization it works on a system of protocols There will be a manual somewhere which tells you what a nail is, what a hammer is, and how the two are to be used together Then in the context of the US military there will be a Halliburton contract for huge numbers of hammers and nails, and a general somewhere with shares in Halliburton who will find a use for both In the view of military planners, then, propaganda is just another hammer Recent figures are conspicuously hard to find, but Fox Newsreportedback in 2009 that the Pentagon was spending $4 7 billion annually on what it calls the human terrain of world public opinion, employing an army of 27,000 whose sole mission was the promotion of US military objectives via media What the numbers are today, we can only guess But it won t be less because it never is Planners of military propaganda will allocate their budgets the same as any public relations company That is, they will focus on predetermined demographics and opinion leaders endlessly testing and measuring to see what is working, what not and using the data thus generated to provide the engine for new, expensive proposals to the client The delivery method or tactic to use public relations speak which Colonel Warren employed this week has become almost hackneyed through over use It is to claim the narrative as fully owned; to assume the conclusions one wishes to see as given; to deny the existence of either the legitimate claims or participation of any party or view but those which suit one s agenda While many consumers of propaganda may not understand this model intellectually, increasing numbers recognize it viscerally They have an intuitive appreciation of the genre, having been exposed to it many thousands of times The state of Israel uses it to exclude the Palestinians from any debate about their own land; corporations use it to achieve and maintain monopolies; governments use it to keep people paying income tax Subconsciously, the model is associated with various forms of oppression and tyranny This hammer and nail school of propaganda has its roots in a vertical and uniform, pre internet informational model The model today is broad and disparate; people can shop for opinions The colonel s activities this week will have helped eat some small part of the budget, but I would argue that this particular assault was a bad use of resources It is too on the nose It looks too much like what it is: a hammer And as people rumble the type of tactic employed above by the Pentagon, they tend to regard the source thereafter as unreliable on point of principle not a good outcome if your goal is to cultivate the human terrain of world public opinion to your advantage @SamGerrans LISTEN MORE: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333700-pentagon-propaganda-us-russia/
"2 Feb, 2016","Gangs, populism, and conspiracy theory overshadow West‚Äôs role in refugee crisis","In the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, Europe continues to lurch to the right, both in the visible form of neo Nazi gangs terrorizing the streets, and also with politicians playing to right wing populism From Stockholm to Dover, gangs have been terrorizing refugees or anyone they perceive to look like one, while also attacking anti fascist protestors These gangs by their own admission are reacting to what they perceive to be their own government s failure in responding to the crisis † The fact their governments caused the crisis is a fact which is apparently lost on them In reality, all these gangs are achieving is to simply play into the hands of the very same governments who happily pipe up about the problems associated with the refugee crisis, while at the same time continue to cause it, with the bombs they drop, and the terror groups and regimes they prop up Nobody in their right mind wants to see any of the crimes associated with the refugee crisis take place, whether we are taking about wars which cause people to leave their homes, or the problems associated with Europe s inability to deal with the crisis States in Europe have laws in place to deal with murder, rape, assault, and any other crimes which take place † All of us want to see an end to misogyny and murder wherever it manifests, whether it is committed by groups or individuals, or committed by states on an industrial scale However, in the current climate, any crime committed by anyone perceived to be a refugee, is immediately brandished in the headlines as proof that all refugees are bad † The same yardstick or measure is not applied to other ethnicities or faiths † If it were, it would probably offer some uncomfortable truths, or reveal the many holes in such pseudo scientific thinking The phenomena of street gangs and politicians playing to the right, is a result of Europe and the West reacting to the crisis, rather than taking an honest look at its causes The way of life many of these groups (and politicians) are talking about protecting , is less to with any Christian values, and is in reality, grounded in propping up the failed economic model of neo colonial capitalism, which itself is predicated on the continuation of illegal wars and subversion of the Middle East and Africa In the same way this model has fooled many of the working classes in Britain, themselves victim of this model, into voting for a political party of the ruling class offering them more of the same economic safety ultimately causing their misery under austerity , this thinking has also caused a dangerous form of reactionary nationalism in Europe to resurface Rather than look at the root cause of the crisis, imperialism, and understand the relationship between war and Western economies, the masses have been duped into believing that the refugee crisis starts and ends with the actual refugees themselves, despite the obvious reasons as to why they have arrived in Europe This thinking is completely westernized and Eurocentric, and provides a convenient scapegoat for the architects of war: Rather than lay the blame for the crisis at the hands of governments and the neo colonial institutions which support their interests, the refugees are blamed † Women, children, it makes no difference as newspaper headlines last week show Or worse still, as we are seeing, more and more people are buying into the idea that a shadowy cabal is behind the crisis, or George Soros and Rothschild Zionists, all intent of course, on destroying Europe s way of life by causing a mass exodus from Africa and the Middle East, to Europe s green pastures Apart from being untrue, this thinking also reeks of anti Semitism, and the sort of racism which should remain dead and buried and which needs no revival † It also is very damaging to the left, because it delegitimizes actual progressive thought † The more this thinking occupies the centre ground helped by the media, the further away from a solution we drift This simplistic scapegoating also diverts away from the fact that it is developed Western economies and the policy which underpins and drives them, which has led to this crisis There is no conspiracy † It s more like business as usual † The refugee crisis is a direct result of both colonialism and in the modern era, neo colonialism, the more sophisticated incarnation of modern capitalism, implementing its own barbarism under the perverse justification of humanitarian intervention In other words, as Europe s thinking goes, It s not enough that we used to occupy and colonize you, you clearly remain incapable of governing yourselves, and so therefore, it is our job to come and do it for you, and to democratize you in the form of bombs and McDonalds † When you come to our shores fleeing our bombs, we will do anything and everything to avoid blaming those who should be blamed including politicians, the wars they advocate, and the consumerism we worship ù It is this psychology, or psychological deficiency depending on your view, which underpins the origin of the refugee crisis, and also which now, rather than seeking to diagnose it, will do anything to explain away what is happening except of course look at the actual cause No shadowy cabal or conspiracy theory is needed to explain what is happening here † People are fleeing their homelands because there is a very real conspiracy by Western governments and its proxies to destabilize and destroy them German police should have right to shoot refugees illegally crossing border AfD leaderhttps://tdotco /yrqa1EUDNXpic twitter com/SfYnobWCtO The relationships between Africa, China, and the Middle East are still developing Russia and China at least, while far from having a perfect relationship with Africa, are at least offering a functional one, and more importantly are perfectly distinguishable one from the West s imperial relationship with Africa and the Middle East The West s strategy in Africa the Middle East, in the Wake of the Arab Sting , is simply one of divide and ruin , meaning that if we (Western governments) can t control your resources, then no one can ùThe West would rather destroy whole countries, and turn them into failed states and torch their resources, than allow states to have a functional relationship with each other with indigenous populations benefiting from the wealth This is how the problem manifests internationally At home, Europe and the West would rather blame a shadowy cabal, or delude themselves that the others Arabs, Muslims or Africans are the problem rather than their own governments This is the problem Europe is failing to recognize, which is giving the US also complicit in wars of aggression, a free pass Until we start to diagnose the problem, rather than engage in right wing populism and neo liberal denialism, ugly

"27 Oct, 2014",Re-elected Dilma wins in a Brazil broken in two,"President Dilma Rousseff of the ruling Worker s Party (PT) was re elected this Sunday in a tight run off against opposition candidate Aecio Neves of the Social Democracy Party of Brazil (PSDB) Sun, sex, samba,
 carnival and at least until the recent World Cup hammering by
 Germany, the land of football ùAnd don t forget vibrant democracy ùEven as it enjoys one of the
 highest soft power quotients around the world, Brazil remains
 submerged by clich√©s Vibrant democracy ùcertainly lived up to its billing in
 this hard fought presidential election Yet another clich√© would
 rule this was the victory of state centric ùpolicies
 against structural reforms ùOr the victory of high social spending ùagainst a pro business ù approach
 which implies business as the privileged enemy of social
 equality Exit clich√©s Enter a cherished national motto: Brazil is
 not for beginners Indeed Brazil s complexities boggle the mind It starts with
 arguably the key, multi layered message a divided country sent to
 winner Dilma Rousseff We are part of a growing middle class We
 are proud to be part of an increasingly less unequal nation But
 we want social services to keep improving We want more
 investment in education We want inflation under control (at the
 moment, it s not) We support a very serious anti corruption
 drive (here s where Dilma s Brazil meets Xi Jinping s China) And
 we want to keep improving on the economic success of the past
 decade Rousseff seems to get the message The question is how she will
 be able to deliver in a continental sized nation suffering from
 appalling education standards, with Brazilian manufacturing
 largely uncompetitive in global markets, and with corruption run
 amok Brazil is now mired in dismal GDP growth of 0 3 percent Just
 blaming the global crisis doesn t cut it; South American
 neighbors Peru at 3 6 percent, and Colombia with 4 8 percent are
 definitely going places in 2014 And yet the numbers are not that shabby Job creation is up 
 Unemployment is down to only 5 4 percent Investment in social
 infrastructure is picking up From 2002 to 2014, the minimum wage
 more than tripled GDP per capita is up, reaching roughly $9,000
 while the 2012 Gini coefficient of social inequality is down Industrial production is back to the same level before the 2008
 financial crisis Brazil paid all its debts to the IMF The
 proportion of debt in relation to GDP is falling reaching only
 33 8 percent in 2013 Workers have more purchasing power and
 even with rising inflation, that mirrors better income
 distribution Social programs have benefited 14 million families roughly 50
 million Brazilians These policies may arguably be derided as too
 little, too late Keynesianism But at least that s a start in a
 nation exploited by immensely ignorant, arrogant and rapacious
 elites for centuries Rousseff s first stint as President may also be blamed for too
 many concessions to big extremely profitable banks in Brazil,
 powerful agribusiness interests and Big Capital What happened,
 in a nutshell, is that the center left Workers Party swung to
 the center and was compelled to make unsavory oligarchic
 alliances The result is that a significant section of its social
 base the metropolitan working class, now heavily indebted to
 sustain its brand new consumer dream ended up flirting with the
 right as a political alternative Add to it the PT s not exactly brilliant management skills True,
 the fight against poverty is a lofty ideal But in such an
 unequal nation, that will take at least until 2030 for really
 serious results Meanwhile, serious planning is in order such
 as building a high speed railway between the two megalopolises,
 Rio and Sao Paulo (the Chinese would do it in a few months) And
 seriously tackling Brazil s oligopolies; banks, corporate media,
 construction/real estate conglomerates, the auto industry lobby Unlike the US and Europe, neoliberalism in Brazil has been
 repeatedly knocked out at the ballot box since 2002, when Lula
 was first elected President As for the social
 democrat ùopposition, there s nothing social, and barely
 democratic, about it The PSDB s pet project is
 turbo neoliberalism, pure and simple Team Neves had everything going for them Their key constituency
 was in fact 60 million mostly angry Brazilian taxpayers over 80
 percent living and working in the wealthier southeastern
 seaboard Life is tough if you are a Brazilian salaried
 professional or the owner of a small and medium enterprise (SME) 
 The tax burden is on a par with the industrialized world but
 you get virtually nothing in return No wonder these irate taxpayers are desperate for decently paved
 roads, urban security, better public hospitals, a public school
 system they can send their children to, and less red tape and
 bureaucracy which add to the nefarious, universally known Brazilian cost ù(as in no value for money) These are
 not Workers Party voters although some of them were What they
 want is galaxies beyond the everyday tribulations of the new,
 large lower middle class created by the social programs first
 implemented by Lula Yet with a mediocre candidate like Neves he even lost in his
 home state, where he was governor neoliberalism does not need
 enemies Neves predictably billed himself as the dragon who would slay
 what Wall Street derides as statism ù cutting
 government spending and liberalizing ùtrade, code for
 privileging corporate US interests At the same time Neves has
 never been able to capture the vote of an overburdened black
 woman in the favelas With Neves, Brazil s future Finance Minister would have been
 Arminio Fraga, a slick operator who, among other things, ran
 high risk funds in emerging markets for George Soros and is also
 a former president of Brazil s Central Bank Some of his
 shenanigans are detailed in More Money than God: Hedge Funds and
 the Making of a New Elite, by Sebastian Mallaby Fraga would have
 been the point man of a Soros inspired government Fraga is the proverbial Wall Street predator With him at the
 Finance Ministry, think J P Morgan controlling Brazil s
 macroeconomic policy The road in fact was already paved by
 PSDB s eminence, former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
 met with key global investors via J P Morgan in New York
 last month Fraga was keen on destroying the Lula and Rousseff
 administrations hyper Keynesian bet on demand ùand
 replace it with supply, via a new capitalist shock ùPredictably, his prescription was amplified by the enormous echo
 chamber of conservative Brazilian media, and drowned everything
 else And as perception is reality, contamination ensued pressuring
 public spending downwards, installing major confusion among
 private investors, and leading Western credit rating agencies to
 confirm the supposed lack of credibility of the Brazilian
 economy Brazil is slowly but surely moving from the semi periphery to
 being closer to the center of the action in international
 relations; because of its own regional geopolitical relevance and
 mostly because of its leading role among the BRICS This is
 happening even as Washington could not give a damn about Brazil 
 or Latin America for that matter US think tank land, ùby the way, abhors BRICS Politically, a victory for the Cardoso/Neves neoliberals a
 ghost of the social democracy they once practiced would have
 thrown Brazilian foreign policy upside down; not only against the
 way the historical winds are blowing, but also against Brazil s
 own national interests As Rousseff argued at the UN last month, Brazil is trying to
 fight a global crisis marked by increasing inequality without
 provoking unemployment and without sacrificing workers jobs and
 salaries As ace economist Theotonio dosSantosstressed, the decadence of the West
 still exerting substantial influence over the Global South via
 their extensive network of collaborators, he also went one up;
 the key fight, as he sees it, is to control Brazilian oil Dos Santos is referring to Brazil s top corporation, Petrobras,
 currently mired in a bribery scandal which must be fully
 investigated that obscures the Holy Grail: the future revenues
 from pre salt ùoil named after the billions of
 barrels of oil capped by a thick layer of salt lying several
 miles below the South Atlantic floor Petrobras plans to invest
 $221 billion up to 2018 to unlock this treasure and expects to
 make a profit even if oil trades around $45 to $50 a barrel Politically, in a nutshell, Rousseff s narrow victory is crucial
 for the future of a progressive, integrated South America It
 will reinvigorate Mercosur the common market of the South as
 well as Unasur the union of South American nations This goes
 way beyond free trade; it s about close regional integration, in
 parallel to close Eurasia integration And starting in 2015, Brazil may be on the road to renewed
 economic expansion again largely boosted by the fruits of pre salt ùand compounded with accelerated building of
 roads, railways, ports and airports That is bound to have a
 ripple effect across Brazil s neighbors As for Washington/Wall Street, the Empire of Chaos is certainly
 not happy and that s a major euphemism, especially after
 betting on thewrong horse, Marina Silva, a sort of Amazon
 rainforest born female counterpart to Obama s change we can
 believe in ùThe fact is, as much as the Brazilian model of
 income distribution is against the interests of big business,
 Brazilian foreign policy is now diametrically opposed to
 Washington s On a lighter note, at least some things will remain the same 
 Like Dilma s diary ù an apocryphal, satirical, ghost
 written take on the President s busy schedule published by top
 Brazilian monthly Piaui, a somewhat local version of The New
 Yorker Here s a typical entry; I watched a whole pirate
 copy of Homeland Awesome! We stayed up late, me and Patriota

 thing extremely believable! ù Who said a vibrant democracy ùcan t also be fun?

"25 Oct, 2014",Ukraine's election: Behind the looking glass,"The vote taking place this weekend in Kiev controlled territories is part of the Maidan junta s desperate quest for legitimacy Nazis still dominate Ukrainian politics, while Kiev dreams of a military final solution for the east In 2001, the Austrian
 economist Hans Hermann Hoppe wrote a book titled Democracy:
 The God that Failed , in which he among other things 
 compared the process of voting to a religious ritual Just as the
 ancient religious rituals served to confirm the divine right of
 ancient kings, the ballot box is used today to bestow the same
 kind of blessing on the secular rulers of modernity In his
 study, Hoppe actually demonstrated that the supposedly oppressive
 monarchies actually safeguarded peoples lives and liberty far
 more than democracy has before making a case for outright
 anarchy Agree with him or not, his comparison of modern
 democracy to ancient religious ritual strikes close to
 home Western leaders routinely speak of democracy as a
 virtue unto itself, even using religious phrasing such as rooted in the sanctity of the individual ù(BH Obama in
 Talinn, September 2014) In actuality, democracy is simply a
 decision making process in which the majority gets its way The way it is practiced by the West in the countries they liberate , however, democracy means whatever the
 liberators say it means Thus an overwhelming vote in favor of
 independence in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk is not democratic 
 because the High Priesthood in the West says so while the
 violent coup in Kiev is the pinnacle of democracy, because it was midwifed ùby Washington (per V Nuland s famous phone
 call) Until it could get itself blessed by a proper ritual, though, the
 junta that came to power in Kiev in February, following a coup
 against President Yanukovich, had a legitimacy problem Its prime
 minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, was essentially appointed by the
 Americans ( Yats is our guy, ùto quote Nuland again) 
 Following the separation of Crimea, the junta called for an early
 presidential vote in May By the time it was held, Donetsk and
 Lugansk had already held independence referenda and declared
 their separation Even so, the junta s Western backers proclaimed
 Petro Poroshenko elected on May 25 as the legitimate leader
 of Ukraine Quite unlike the aggressor and invader ù it was
 accused of being, Moscow was willing to accept that, even after
 Poroshenko launched an all out war against the two eastern
 regions That war was lost Though the Ukrainian Army has resorted to
 lobbing ballistic missiles at cities, while volunteer Nazi
 battalions such as Azov have terrorized any civilians
 they came across, all attempts to crush the rebellion in the East
 have failed Hence all the crying about Russian
 invasion to the Western press, but also the coming general
 election That way, the Kiev junta can try and show their Western
 sponsors (George Soros being the most recent, outspoken fan) that
 they are democratic , and thus worth backing More so than anything that has happened in Ukraine over the past
 nine months, this weekend s vote will showcase the absurdity of democracy as practiced by the genuinely undemocratic 
 What was the Maidan, if not the rejection of democratic
 procedures in favor of outright mob rule? With dissidents beaten
 up, imprisoned, shot or burned alive (as in Odessa), the scope of
 acceptable political positions in Ukraine today is the triangle
 between the Nationalist Socialist Oleg Tyagnybok, Right Sector
 boss Dmitry Yarosh and Radical nationalist Oleg Lyashko And with
 every torchlight parade and fresh honor given to these Nazis 
 not the neo variety, but the actual, unrepentant WWII kind 
 that triangle keeps getting smaller Recent polls by the Western funded Democratic Initiatives
 Foundation and published by the Kyiv Post suggest a significant
 lead for President Poroshenko s party, followed by Lyashko s
 Radicals and Yatsenyuk s People s Front Meanwhile, the
 formerly ruling Party of Regions and the Communists 
 intimidated, brutalized and all but banned are polling in
 single digits However, some 32 percent of respondents have said
 they were undecided ù, which suggests they are either
 afraid to reveal their preferences, or haven t yet decided on the
 lesser of evils Residents of those parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions still
 under Kiev s control will have a choice to vote for the flavor of
 their occupiers; 13 out of 21 electoral districts in the Donetsk
 Region and five out of 11 in the Lugansk Region are to be open

 to vote; for whatever reason, the junta s legislature failed to
 pass a law providing for voting by soldiers at the front Meanwhile, the civilsociety organizations funded for
 years by the West (for example, National Endowment for Democracy

 fertile ground for the Maidan rebellion are reporting widespread
 violations of campaign rules Per the Kyiv Post, OPORA has
 already reported over 527 violations, including at least 80
 cases of alleged voter bribery ùThey either haven t got the
 memo about how this election should be a showcase of democratic 
 Ukraine versus the authoritarian Russia, or they did
 get the memo, and are significantly under reporting voter

 go along with the vote, scheduling their own elections for
 November 7 They may not have a chance to hold them There isn t
 much left of the September ceasefire, if constant reports of
 artillery and ballistic missile attacks are anything to go by A
 renewed Ukrainian offensive as winter approaches may be a stupid
 idea, but the junta s generals have certainly demonstrated
 greater stupidity over the course of the campaign When Croatia separated from Yugoslavia, in June 1991, several
 Serb majority areas refused to accept Zagreb s rule The Croatian
 government, backed by Germany, initially failed to conquer these
 areas, and accepted a UN guaranteed armistice (Vance Plan) Four
 years later, backed by the US, Zagreb launched an all out assault
 and reintegrated the territories by force, expelling
 some 200,000 Serbs that lived there Poroshenko s adviser Yury

 Secretary of State s Office, AP reported Thursday In order to
 qualify for the November ballot, New Approach Oregon, the group
 behind the initiative, need to gather 87,213 valid signatures by
 July 3 The initiative, IP 53, seeks to legalize the possession of
 marijuana for adults 21 and older and to allow for licensed and
 regulated cultivation and sales which would be taxed The measure would legalize the personal possession of up to eight
 ounces and allow for the cultivation of four plants The Oregon
 Liquor Control Commission would oversee and regulate the
 marijuana industry, with a marijuana tax set at $35 an ounce The group says 40 percent of the tax revenue generated by the
 legalization scheme will go to school funding, 35 percent to
 state and local police, and 25 percent to drug treatment,

"30 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãGulf toil?,"US Saudi relations have long been grounded in an oil for security exchange But with U S dependence on Middle Eastern oil diminishing and Saudi power rising, is there a growing gulf in the Gulf? Has the US spat with Russia affected this relationship, and could it lead to a change in the Syrian deadlock? Oksana is joined by Dr David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, to drill into these issues WATCH: https://www rtdotco m/shows/worlds apart oksana boyko/http://www youtube com/user/WorldsApartRT/videos FOLLOW:Oksana Boyko@OksanaBoyko_RTWorlds Apart@WorldsApart_RT Oksana Boyko:Hello and welcome to Worlds Apart President Obama spoke a lot about the good and bad ways of doing geopolitics this week a rhetoric intended for European and possibly Russian ears that was all but brushed aside when he landed in Saudi Arabia How is it that American values seem to depreciate every time the Saudis are involved? To discuss that, I m now joined by David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Dr Weinberg, thank you very much for taking time to talk to us David Weinberg:Thank you for having me OB:Now, the organisation you work for was set up after 9/11 to promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism ù Is there any country that is more antithetic to all those objectives than Saudi Arabia? DW:Sure, Syria, Iran, lots of countries But certainly there s a big gap between the values of the US and the values of the Saudis It s a relationship that s been strained by the conflicting values of the two sides OB:But my question was whether Saudi Arabia really takes the cake for essentially lacking all the three elements that are mentioned in the purposes of the organisation that you work for Again, there is not much in the way of pluralism, they don t value democracy at all, and when it comes to the ideology espoused by Saudi Arabia not only it condones terrorism, it actually supports it DW:Yeah, I mean look, dictatorship is not a contest, but if it were, the Saudis would be doing great My organisation has actually been quite active on this issue For instance, this week we put out a report highlighting the hate that is continually, still being taught in Saudi Arabia s public schools through their textbook system So, we certainly are no friends of the Saudis on this issue, and we certainly hope that the President had some very serious conversations about human rights behind closed doors, while he was in Saudi Arabia OB:Well this is a very mild way of putting it But Saudi Arabia is not officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism And yet it is well known that it is the largest source of financing when it comes to militant jihadi groups such as the Taliban or Al Qaeda And I hardly need to mention that it is Americans who suffered a great deal from the terror plots hatched, and sometimes executed with the help of Saudi money Fifteen out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals And when you think about it, had they been Russians, I think we could have had an outbreak of World War III by now But with the Saudis, again, it s always let s be patient with them ù And it may be a personal question, but for a country like Russia, which often finds itself on the receiving end of US condemnation without hurting a single American, it s very difficult to understand why would Americans let the Saudis off the hook so easily, given how many Americans were hurt in 9/11? DW:Absolutely Well, you know, I think it s reflected, first of all, in public opinion numbers Saudi Arabia has absolutely dreadful numbers when you as the American public what they think of the other country But when you say Saudi money going to sponsor terrorism, I m curious whether you mean state money going to sponsor terrorism, or whether you mean private money going to sponsor terrorism? Which do you mean? OB:Well Dr Weinberg, I mean both Because obviously, there are some private sponsors of terror groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Lebanon They used to sponsor insurgency in Chechnya as well But official government structures in Saudi Arabia are not the most transparent, so you can never be sure that official money is not being used for the same purpose DW:But is there evidence of official money? I don t think so OB:Well, I think Prince Bandar, for one, is quite involved in sponsoring various rebel groups in Syria And I guess we can argue about the definition of terrorism and freedom fighting, but I think it is pretty clear that Saudi Arabia is supporting groups that use terror as a tactic in Syria So, that would be, sort of, evidence, wouldn t it? DW:Sure, I mean I think that some of Saudi Arabia s identified clients in Syria are extremely unappealing For instance, the extremist group most convincingly tied to Saudi governmental assistance is called Jaysh al Islam, or the Army of Islam, which is led by a man called Zahran Alloush, whose father is a preacher in Saudi Arabia, and who advocates ethnic cleansing of Shiites and opposes democracy This is an organisation that by and large is repulsive and antithetical to western values, and it s an organisation that the US has been, to my understanding, pushing the Saudis behind the scenes to reduce their support for OB:You just mentioned how little support there is for the Saudis and their tactics among the American public And yet American politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, seem to be sort of welcoming, or at least tight lipped, when it comes to criticism of the Saudi officials Why do you think that is? DW:Well, I think we need to differentiate between the executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue Because, I think the legislative branch has been quite comfortable raising concerns about Saudi policies that conflict with universal human rights and democratic values So for instance, members of Congress for both parties, in the last week and a half, have issued letters to the President, calling on him to make human rights part of the discussion, and to make religious freedom part of the discussion when he went to Saudi Arabia So I do think that American politicians of both stripes, be it Democratic or Republican, are not reluctant to speak out about this issue But I do think that when either party is in power at the White House, they certainly have incentives to try elicit regional cooperation from the Saudis, and unfortunately sometimes that means human rights reform issues get kicked a little bit lower on the priority list Just as that sometimes is the case in US relations with Russia American officials would actually like to be raising these issues even more often than they do with Russia, but because of Russia s important role as a geopolitical power, don t even raise it as much as they actually would, as surprising as that may be for some of your viewers to hear OB:But Dr Weinberg, I wonder how much more often those issues could be raised? Because I think human rights in Russia is one of the most popular issues for American politicians, whether of the executive or legislative branch But going back to Saudi Arabia, President Obama has just visited Riyadh What do you think he was hoping to achieve there? DW:Well I think the messaging coming out of the White House really focused on trying to dispel the image that there s a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United States So even as the President s plane was pulling into Saudi Arabia, his deputy national security advisor was giving a briefing to the press corps, and he was trying to emphasise that things have gotten better in the US Saudi relationship since the fall, when the Saudis were upset So, not denying that the Saudis have been upset with the US, but trying to argue that that dispute over Iran, over Syria, over other issues, has been resolved or at least significantly reduced As to whether that narrative is going to be seen as persuasive, either by the media or the general public, we still have yet to see OB:Now the biggest strain, as many analysts have identified, in this bilateral relationship is Americas reluctance to fully back the Saudis in their existential fight against the Shia forces of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, possibly Iraq And this fight that the Saudis are in is not driven by money, it is not driven by political calculations It is driven by genuine values, however archaic and bigoted they may be And I wonder, given the existential nature of this fight, whether Americans can really reason with the Saudis at this point, or is it increasingly a case of the tail wagging the dog here DW:Well, I certainly would agree with you with regard to your argument that this is an area where the US really has some difficulties satisfying the Saudis fully You know, the Saudi public sees what s going on in Syria as the greatest humanitarian calamity of our age And that s not my words, that s the Saudi Foreign Minister s words And so what they see are Shiites, whom they already have dehumanised in their education and religious system as heretics, slaughtering Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, slaughtering Sunni civilians as well as rebels And so, in that regard, the Saudis want the US to decapitate the regime in Syria, at the very least by toppling it And so the Saudis are not going to be satisfied when they see the US pursuing an approach that actually, in some regards on the battlefield, is quite similar to Russia s strategy, which is to have this conflict turn into a stalemate The Russians want to enable Assad to not be toppled, to outlast the conflict And the US wants to ensure, like Russia purportedly, a political solution to this conflict, by ensuring that the rebels are not fully marginalised on the battlefield But when it comes to actually toppling the Assad regime militarily, the US administration has held back to some extent until now And we ll just have to see whether the Saudis can convince them to take a harder line on this It certainly could happen, especially if there s no progress at Geneva OB:Since you mentioned Russia s intentions in Syria, I think Russia would much have preferred not having this conflict to begin with I think this conflict was initiated and aided by Saudi Arabia and the US to begin with So it is those two countries that actually opted for changing the status quo But rather than going in depth into Syria, I would like to ask you very quickly this relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was founded on a quite explicit agreement that Washington would defend the Gulf state in exchange for oil contracts And the US no longer needs that much Saudi oil, and the nature of security threats has also changed So I wonder if it s possible that, sooner or later, the US and Saudi Arabia will have to part ways? DW:Well, first of all, I d like to address something that you said right before your question, which is how this conflict started As Americans see it, the way this conflict started was a Russian supported dictator, Bashar al Assad, slaughtered his people when they went out on the street and peaceably demonstrated As well as arresting and torturing teenagers So that is how we see how this conflict started As to whether the US and the Saudis OB:Well, you see this conflict this way because you are told that this conflict started this way As somebody who was on the ground in Syria, all those three years ago, I can tell you that there were snipers, there were provocation, there were Saudi agents there on the scene So obviously the tactics of Bashar al Assad are not to be defended, and his indiscriminate use of force But I wonder if the US would react in any different way if the constitutional law and order were threatened? For once, if I can remind you of the search operation for the Boston bombers, if you remember a couple of years ago The whole city of Boston was blocked to find two men, police was used and he was shot dead So, I think Americans use force quite extensively when their own security is compromised, but they for some reason deny that right to other countries But I would still like you to answer that question about whether you see any chance for the US and Saudi Arabia parting ways geopolitically, given how different their value systems really are? DW:Well, having lived in Boston, having actually lived on the same block as the Boston bomber, having been a graduate student at MIT in the past where a police officer was slaughtered by the bombers no doubt Americans take terrorism seriously As to whether the Saudis and the US are going to part ways, the triumphalism of the shale energy boom to some extent is overwrought Because the US, just as Russia, just as other countries are in the global economy, are dependant on stability in the global price of oil And in that regard, until industrialised countries such as the US, such as Russia, such as the countries of east and south Asia, have fuel choice about the fuel they put in their automobiles, we re going to be continually dependant on the security in the Gulf OB:I see Dr Weinberg, we have to take a short break now, but when we come back the United States has rediscovered its good old enemy in Russia What does this mean for the future of US Saudi relations? That s coming up in a few moments on Worlds Apart OB:Welcome back to Worlds Apart where we are discussing the love hate relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia with David Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies DW:That s a great way of putting it OB:Dr Weinberg, you just heard, I turned it in terms of love and hate, and I m not sure about the love, but to see the examples of hatred, all you need to do is to open the Saudi school textbooks, which you alluded to earlier, that for decades have been spewing vitriol at everything Western And as you mentioned, you wrote a very interesting report recently on how lenient the US has been recently with Saudi Arabia on this issue But I wonder, what is the real reason for Saudi procrastination in removing all those vitriolic passages from their textbooks? DW:Well, first of all, I d like to say that I don t think that the US has been uniquely lax when it comes to raising Saudi textbooks In fact, I think it s done more than any other government in its exchanges with the Saudi authorities on this issue For instance, I saw no indication that this was part of the conversation when Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin met last year in Moscow So I think there are things that other countries could do That having been said, the US has more leverage that it could potentially use with Saudi Arabia on this issue And in that regard, I really do with the US would do more OB:Well Dr Weinberg, the reason why President Putin may not raise this issue, or other issues, with foreign visitors is because Russia doesn t make the promotion of democracy the pillar of its foreign policy It s the US that does And if I m not mistaken, the State Department first noted a problem with the Saudi textbooks all the way back in 2003 And ever since then, the Saudis have assumed this very typical approach for them of not saying no outright, but not delivering either And my question to you is whether they see any practical gain in essentially indoctrinating their youth in this mindset, whether they do it on purpose as a part of state ideology? DW:Well, I think Saudi Arabia, like any country, does have some internal debates, even as an absolute monarchy But that having been said, I do think that the Saudi authorities bear responsibility for what s in these books, especially because these books are printed on an annual basis by their Ministry of Education So they are to blame for what s published in their texts The Saudi monarch, and the Saudi royal family, and the government say that these books have been reformed, that they re being improved But when they say that, they only take the lowest hanging fruit They take some of the hatred out of elementary school books They say that they spent money on teacher training, to moderate teachers They say that they re increasing the number of women in universities But the reason that they don t take this on more seriously, I think, is because they see more benefit in not upsetting their conservative, reactionary preachers, than they see in telling their children a more tolerant view of the world and keeping their children from being indoctrinated So I do think that it really will take diplomatic consequences in Saudi Arabia s foreign relations with the international community for this to change OB:Now, this violent extremism that children are being taught in Saudi public schools is bad when it is targeted at you, but when it targets some of your rivals, it may come in handy And here I would like to shift gears a little bit and discuss the Saudi US relations vis a vis Russia, because there are quite a few historic examples when this partnership was very successful in undermining Moscow I wonder whether these recent tensions that we saw between Russia and the West, and the US in particular, could lead President Obama to re evaluate or rethink his relationship with Saudi Arabia DW:Actually, I think US Russian relations in the last month have added an extra strain to to the US Saudi relationship Because the Saudis wish that the US had been firmer with Russia over the Crimea Just as they saw the US choosing to pursue a negotiated deal with Russia over Syria s chemical weapons in the fall, this was an area where US, Russia I d like to say at least averting away from more direct conflict actually came at some cost to the US in its relationship with the Saudis Similarly, the US helped turned the tide of the battle in Afghanistan in the 80s, against the Soviet Union, by introducing a large number of MANPADS man portable air defence systems that the Mujahiddeen used against the Soviet air force The US hasn t gotten much credit from the Russians for something that they ve done, which is showing some restraint when it comes to MANPADS in Syria today The Saudis have been itching to introduce those in massive numbers, unsupervised, without any sort of permissive action links, without any sort of way for the US, for instance, to disable them if they fall in the hands of Al Qaeda But the US has actually held relatively firm on that to date, and that s an area in which the US hasn t gotten much credit OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, I think this is a very novel interpretation of both recent events in history Because if it wasn t for the US and Saudi Arabia, those weapons wouldn t be in Syria in the first place So I don t see how we can credit the US for not restraining Saudi Arabia well enough Going back to Ukraine, there have been reports that Washington has already reached out to Saudi Arabia to provide some of the $15 billion promised to Ukraine And while Saudi Arabia doesn t have any intrinsic interest in Ukraine, what it is interested in is seeing Washington toughen up on Syria And I wonder if we could see any sort of Ukraine for Syria swap here essentially Saudi Arabia giving the money for Ukraine, but Washington in return doing what Riyadh wants it to do in Syria? DW:You know, actually the most persuasive tit for tat of this sort that I ve seen has been a recent story in the Washington Post, suggesting that the US is finally considering doubling its training of vetted Syrian rebels, to be funded by the Qatari treasury So if there s going to be a tit for tat, in this regard, that s actually where I ve seen some suggestions that it might happen OB:Now, Russia is a natural rival for the US in Ukraine, and for Saudi Arabia in Syria so much so that George Soros has already suggested that the two team up in driving the oil prices down And of course, this move proved to be very effective back in the 80s, when these two countries colluded in driving the oil prices down, and that proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union Do you think that could work this time around? DW:No, I don t think there s persuasive US Saudi collusion on the energy price that actually influences Saudi energy policy The Saudis make their oil production decisions based on internal budgetary issues, and they do this also by looking at the domestic situation in Saudi Arabia and making outlays to keep their public quiet So that, I think, is actually going to be the biggest driver of Saudi oil policy But, you know, they can be hypocritical about this too, just as the US can be hypocritical about where and when it supports democracy, just as Russia can be hypocritical about where and when it supports sovereignty OB:I wonder if we could consider one more way of how the Saudis and Americans could exact their vengeance, or their revenge on Russia, and that would be by supporting terror groups They used to do that in Chechnya, as I mentioned before, and they could probably do the same in Crimea, which has a somewhat sizeable population, couldn t they? DW:Well actually, the Muslim population in Crimea is significantly smaller before Stalin ethnically cleansed the place So actually, I think that leverage is much smaller now OB:But, just fore the benefit of our viewers, as far as I know, I may be mistaken but back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Crimea was a very popular destination for wounded Chechen rebels First, because of the geographic proximity to Chechnya, and also because of the somewhat lax security policy of the Ukrainian authorities I think it is estimated that at the moment, there are around 5,000 followers of the Wahhabi branch of Islam in the Crimea, and I guess you wouldn t need even that many to stir trouble? DW:Well, you know, first of all it is important to distinguish between people s religious views, be they intolerant or not, and whether they re actually engaged in acts of violence But certainly I do think that when an intolerant brand of religion is promoted in places abroad, including in elements of the Soviet Union, there are consequences for that down the road, absolutely OB:Well one of the natural consequences for Moscow would be to deepen its ties with Tehran, especially given the very politically correct reaction of the Rouhani government to Crimea s joining Russia But I wonder if that will deepen the trenches even more in this geopolitical rivalry? DW:It s absolutely possible, but I do think it conflicts with what the Rouhani government s strategy is in Iran, which is a little bit different than what the Supreme Leader s strategy is in Iran The Supreme Leader s strategy is direct confrontation with the US The Rouhani government s strategy is to maintain many of the Islamic republic s policies, but to try and achieve some sort of rapprochement with the international community They may not be ready to pay the cost of what that entails, and they ve given no indication that they re ready to stop the IRGC s terrorist activities in places like the Levant and the Gulf And that s actually what motivates the Saudis to push hard when it comes to Iran issues, and something that the US, personally I think, could be doing a little more on Certainly Russia could do more on it as well OB:Well, Dr Weinberg, unfortunately we have to leave it there, I appreciate your being on the show DW:Thank you, Oksana OB:And to our viewers keep the conversation going on our Twitter, YouTube and Facebook pages and I hope to see you again same place, same time here on Worlds Apart RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/worlds-apart-oksana-boyko/usa-saudi-russia-relations-165/
"28 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIntellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"14 Mar, 2014",'Britain‚Äôs being relegated to lowest tier in EU‚Äô - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near death state of Ukrainian finances but doesn t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it s great to have you with us today I m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously the EU s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine ù Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them how and why? Bill Cash:I m very much in favor of political cooperation, I m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious It would have been far better if it had been a lower key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was misconceived ùand he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I ll just quote from it: This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits ùIn retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn t been so ambitious I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely na√Øve I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation SS:But what about now, Mr Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it s on the brink of bankruptcy can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is No ù, and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this because when they say 35 billion ùyou can usually add quite a lot more The fact is that proportionately, we re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt SS:But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won t end up in the new elite s pockets? BC:Well, that s a very important question It could apply to almost any country of the EU The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years so the probability of the money getting astray is very very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption That is well known Quite frankly, we don t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don t think the money is there to pay for it SS:Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don t know What I do know is that there are very big questions here I mean, I m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well negotiated answer to these problems I m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years SS:Keeping in mind everything you ve said right now, Mr Cash and talking about being realistic what do you think about Ukraine s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries I m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said we should be associated, but not absorbed ù, and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U S and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating SS:Yeah, but it doesn t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break I m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U S diplomats which openly dismiss the EU s efforts in Ukraine should the EU swallow its pride and follow America s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the European Union must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy I m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU It is just simply a complete mess, and I don t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy SS:The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I ve seen the regulations in question In fact, I m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you ù, and given the fact that everyone is saying there won t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very very bad situation When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better SS:Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don t regard the EU as having its own money as such it s a way of interpreting the situation When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it As far as I m concerned, it s our money and I m very glad we re getting it back again I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself SS:Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem As one EU official put it, the scale of it is breathtaking ù Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking I may say that I wouldn t exonerate any country, I don t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world It s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy It s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts All I can say is that it has to be dealt with The court of Auditors of the EU do their best We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly every year I ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn t been signed off, as far as I m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether SS:Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don t think that the consequences and this is a very large subject of majority voting and co decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically I don t think that s healthy, as I ve said in Germany itself, I don t think it s healthy for Germany and I don t think it s healthy for Europe as a whole SS:Now you ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two tier Europe which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I ve said over this, over the last 20 years there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time SS:Talking about great democracy and protecting it you ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I ve just said By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy SS:But, here s another thing You ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream what s changed? BC:Well, I think that s the recognition that it didn t work It has taken a very very long time People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right not with any great self satisfaction, because as far as I m concerned, it s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s SS:Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land mass Unlike France it is a relatively small land mass And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded I am actually not in principle against immigration I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen But, by the same token, there have to be limits An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain s membership of the EU That s it for this edition of the Sophie&Co, we ll see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/british-mp-eu-problems-738/
"30 Apr, 2013",Poor Italy‚Ä¶!

Commission s European Chairman Mario Monti is out; and Trilateral
Commission Member Enrico Letta is in Long live the Trilateral
Commission!It seems that there is just nothing any country in the West can do
to free itself from the shackles of the Global Power Masters and
their Megabankers No matter what elections are held; no matter what mass
demonstrations bring citizens on to the streets; no matter how many
signs are shown on millions of TV screens accusing the Megabankers
of being the worst crooks, the truth is there for all to see: the
Global Power Masters have taken over governments in country after
country, enslaving all nations to their Megabankers The mainstream media broadcast it; the alternative media point out
the sheer inhumanity of it all, even in the European Union where
double digit unemployment is rampant, banks are fraudulently
 bailed in by stealing account holders money, and millions of
workers houses are foreclosed on There just does not seem to be anything anybody anywhere can do
about it It all basically boils down to the vast majority of working people
in just about every country suffering the most perverse, unfair and
blatant discrimination of all: when small but extremely powerful,
unelected and illegitimate minorities discriminate against the vast
majority of disorganized and as yet unawakened citizens This is not a conspiracy theory or any such rubbish This is
something that s right before our eyes All you need to do is look
in the right places, see who are running this greatest show on
Earth , and then think with your own commonsense mind instead of
letting CNN or Rupert Murdoch do the thinking for you After three time premier Silvio Berlusconi sank Italy to new depths
of decadence where its workers have been sucked into an economic
Eurocratic maelstrom that finally led to his resignation in
November 2011, the Megabankers decided at the time to take over
Italy outright That was when they replaced Berlusconi with Mario Monti of
Trilateral Commission glory as Italy s prime minister, aswe then explained on RT Now, after Italy s recent elections we saw its aging President
Giorgio Napolitano again put a Rockefeller/Rothschild Boy in power;
because Enrico Letta too is a Trilateral Commission member And to
make sure that Megabanker theft is duly supplemented by traditional
Italian political mafias, Letta s coalition government includes
members of Berlusconi s party After all, his uncle Gianni Letta
was/is Berlusconi s right hand man So, yes indeed: Poor
Italy! The Trilateral Commission brings together Rockefeller, Morgan,
Warburg, Rothschild, Lazard, Goldman Sachs and Soros banking
interests under the aegis of global power elite geopolitical
planners like Sir Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Dominique
Mo√Øsi, Richard Perle, Philip Zelikow and Paul Wolfowitz, amongst
many others Notably, both PMs, the outgoing Mario Monti and incoming Enrico
Letta, serve the Trilateral Agenda shoulder to shoulder with the
top brass from such global megabanks as CitiCorp, HSBC, Barclays,
Nomura, Banco Santander, BBVA Bank, UBS, NM Rothschild, Deutsche
Bank, BNP, Commerzbank, † Goldman Sachs, Lazard, Mediobanca,
Morgan Stanley, Warburg Pincus, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of New
York Mellon, and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Overworld banking
agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal
Reserve Bank, Bank of England, European Central Bank, Dutch Central
Bank, Bank of † Greece, and Bank of Japan † Just a
sampling to show that this is a most powerful high class money club
if ever there was one At 70, Monti is an elderly man; at 46, Letta is a promising young
politician In Italian politics it seems that the more things
change, the more they stay the same The key question that should once again be on every Italian s mind
is: will Enrico Letta work to improve the plight of the Italian
people or to promote bankers interests? Former Argentine President
Juan Per√≥n once said that all nations presidents and premiers have
a foremost decision to make: they either govern to promote and
protect the interests of their people over and above those of the
global megabankers, or they merely work for the global megabankers
and against their own people It s a political coin that has had to be tossed by leaders time and
again since the times of Jesus † Those making the right
decision for their people often end up ousted, assassinated and
demonized Looking at the list and track records of Trilateralists who have
been catapulted into the highest echelons of power in government 
Papademos in Greece, Monti in Italy, Cavallo in Argentina, Bill
Clinton and George HW Bush in the US, Horst Kohler in Germany,
Toomas Ilves in Estonia, Condoleezza and Susan Rice (yes, both of
them!) in the US one can see a pattern So, yes: friends, Romans and countrymen everywhere, the Trilateral
Commission certainly does nave enormous clout and leverage to
promote its globalist agenda over and above every country s
national interest Letta s ascent to become Italy s new prime minister a country
with huge economic, financial, social and political problems once
again raises the question: Who decides?Is it the Italian people who have freely and democratically chosen
to have an elite megabanker friendly bureaucrat run their country
or as in Greece, France, the UK and so many other countries is
there a hidden hand that discretely catapults its own servants into
the highest places of power?Do We, the People ever really decide anything or are we just
asked to legitimize through some high profile election, decisions
they have already taken? Do our real political choices thus boil
down to two, maybe three, elite candidates? A sort of
 you can have Coke or Pepsi non choice?If this only happened in Italy, we could say that it s some sort of
 Italian problem † But, no: there s clearly a pattern whereby
global power brokers first recruit and then very discretely promote
their chosen players to the top echelons of entities like the
Trilateral Commission where they are suitably groomed, positioned,
prepared, coached and politically and financially armed 
Normally, such individuals have little or no allegiance to their
countries of origin and countrymen, but rather are align to the
supranational globalist agenda And they plan well in advance too! † An April 27 FoxNews TV
report just aired a pro Bush Family program showing that The Powers
That Be are already busy toying with the idea that Jeb Bush 
another Baby Bush might just be the right guy to run for
president of the United States on the Republican Party ticket in
2016 s presidential elections Not surprisingly, many powerful Democrats are, in turn, already
working to put Hillary Clinton as their candidate for those
presidentials That would mean that in 2016 the American people just might have to
choose between Jeb Bush (son of Trilateral member George HW Bush)
and Hillary Clinton (wife of Trilateralist Bill Clinton) † I
know, I know: just a coincidence Come to think of it, maybe the title of this article should not
just be Poor Italy , but rather Poor Italy and Greece
and Argentina and Germany and USA and Estonia and Benjamin Disraeli British Queen Victoria s prime minister in the
19th century once said that ÄúThe world is governed by very
different personages from what is imagined by those who are not

"12 Apr, 2013",US seeks allied regime in Malaysia as millions funnelled to opposition,"As Malaysia gears up for its most critical general election ever, a prominent opposition figure has come forward with allegations American foundations organized protest rallies and channelled funds to opposition political parties In early May 2013, Malaysia will face its most competitive
political battle since its independence in the form of an election
that pits Malaysia s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which
has governed the country since 1957, against the opposition Pakatan
Rakyat (PR) coalition that has received extensive training and
backing from US government funded foundations Washington has often seen Malaysia s leaders as stubborn, and as
the unpopularity of the ruling coalition increases, organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have significantly
greased the wheels to improve the US friendly opposition s chances
of coming to power through multi faceted media campaigns and
support for anti government street demonstrations On one side, Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad often
caught the ire of Washington for his unceasing criticism of Israel
and US foreign policy, while the incumbent PM Najib Razak has toned
down the rhetoric and has pursued a business friendly approach with
the West, while deepening economic ties with China On the other side, de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who
formerly served as Deputy PM under Mahathir s government, leans
closely to the United States During his political tenure, Anwar was sacked for implementing
IMF austerity measures while Mahathir spearheaded Malaysia s
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis through currency
controls and protectionist measures After his political fall, he
served as Chairman of the Development Committee of the World Bank
and IMF in 1998, and later chaired the Washington based Foundation
for the Future, a US funded think tank established by Elizabeth
Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Anwar enraged
many in Muslim majority Malaysia when he stated that he would
support a policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal a stark contrast to the ruling
coalitions firm stance in support of Palestine Anwar s unique
credentials and close ties to the US political and financial
establishment make him undeniably preferred in Washington The National Endowment for Democracy or NED, is a
Washington based foundation that supports democratic initiatives
and US friendly opposition groups abroad, provides over $1 million
to various projects in Malaysia each year The NED has regularly
come under fire because of the overtly political nature of its
programs, and because senior US political figures have leading
roles in the foundation In addition to funding electoral watchdogs, human rights
monitors and news websites that slant toward the opposition, the
International Republican Institute has received millions for its
Malaysian programs, which assist political parties and their
associated think tanks in being effective representatives of their
constituencies ùIRI is chaired by conservative Senator John
McCain, known for his extremely aggressive position in favor of
Israel and US conflicts overseas, while other leading figures have
held senior foreign policy positions in the Reagan and Bush
administrations IRI works in countries important to U S 
interests, where we can make a difference IRI focuses on three
tasks: helping political parties broaden their appeal, ensuring
that they rule justly once elected and aiding civilsociety in
guaranteeing good governance IRI can help catalyze the efforts of
democratic activists in a country so long as they want change
more than we want it for them, ùwrites IRI s president, Lorne
Craner, who previously held a position in the US State
Department The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also
receives a huge budget for their Malaysian projects Madeleine
Albright, former US Secretary of State, a famous cheerleader for
American exceptionalism and NATO militarism, chairs NDI In
addition, both former US Senator Thomas Daschle and former AIPAC
director Kenneth Wollack have high positions in NDI Malaysia s
opposition coalition won historic gains in the 2008 elections and
took control of key states such as Penang and Selangor According
to the NED s website, IRI received $802,122 in 2010 to work
with state leaders in Penang and Selangor to provide them with
public opinion research, training and other resources to enable
them to be more effective representatives of their
constituents ù IRI claims that it does not provide direct
funding to political parties ùin Malaysia, but their lack of
transparency, significant budget and emphasis on helping broaden
the appeal of political parties in opposition held states suggests
at the very minimum that funding is taking place
indirectly NED is funded primarily through the US Congress, within the
budget of USAID, the US agency for development assistance, which is
part of the US State Department this means that the money NED
gives to foreign countries comes from public funds paid by US
taxpayers Funding mostly flows to its two main component parties,
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) NED is
required to publish its financial disbursements, but this doesn t
apply to the smaller foundations that it in turn finances, such as
the IRI and NDI, both the main recipients of funding in
Malaysia According to the NDI s official website, it conducts state level parliamentary workshops in Selangor and Penang ùbecause opposition parties have had limited experience in
government, many of the parliamentarians elected in 2008 lacked a
fundamental understanding of parliamentary processes and of
representing constituent concerns ùStarting from 2007,
Malaysians have shown support for Bersih, an electoral watchdog
group known as the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections Bersih has organized rallies calling for electoral reform, which
many criticized as being as thinly veiled anti government protests
due to the participation of key opposition figures Bersih
coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, recipient of the US State
Department s Award for International Women of Courage, has under
pressure conceded that Bersih accepted funds from US
government linked foundations such as NDI, and the Open Society
Institute, headed by billionaire financier George Soros Tunku
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, a Malaysian senator and former opposition
figure, has recently issued statements detailing American
involvement in funding and organizing the Bersih rallies Aziz said that Americans from US based foundations were calling
the shots and outlining the functions and operations of Bersih In the meeting, I was offered to head the watchdog because they
said I have the credentials, integrity and credibility for the
post They told me that the movement was to ensure free and fair
elections in the country, ùsaid Tunku Aziz, disclosing that he
was offered some $4,000 monthly plus other perks and allowances for
his position Aziz also accused Malaysia s opposition leader of
using Bersih to channel support to his political campaign, Anwar makes good use of his international networking to get
these funds I don t know whether Bersih leaders knew it or not 
But Bersih is Anwar s vehicle to receive international funds under
the guise of democracy and free and fair elections Bersih is not a
non partisan independent organisation It s Anwar s baby ùAziz
resisted overseas funding because he claims it compromises national
integrity and dignity Local organisations should justify their
existence to Malaysians, not to foreigners Local organisations
should not owe their existence and allegiance to foreigners, ùhe stressed Upon closer examination of the language used by these
foundations, when they claim to be working toward broadening
the appeal of political parties, ùa critical question comes to
mind when does so called democracy promotion become
political interference? The work of the NED has ostensibly blurred
the line between the two, while masking their overt backing for
actors they support in the benign language of electoral
transparency, freedom and the promotion of human rights Malaysia s
ruling coalition is far from perfect it is unwilling to address
issues of high level corruption, elite opulence remains a huge
problem, and racial minorities feel animosity over ethnic based
affirmative action policies that favor the Muslim majority The
opposition coalition, which has vowed to eliminate authoritarianism
and elite graft, has released a manifesto that some have lauded,
while others have been more skeptical of NED does not conduct a
single democracy initiative in neighboring US ally Singapore,
despite having a less democratic environment than that of Malaysia
 so what could be motivating Washington to spend so much attention
on supporting Malaysia s opposition coalition? Let s not ignore the elephant in the room the real purpose of
America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify
the region as a counterweight against Beijing PM Najib Razak has
attached primary importance to Malaysia s relationship with China,
as he looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented
economy after the 2008 global financial crisis Sino Malaysian
exchange in areas such as finance, infrastructure development,
science and technology, and education have never been higher China
has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures
reaching $90 billion in 2011 while Malaysia is China s largest
trading partner among ASEAN nations Washington s backing for
Malaysia s US friendly opposition must be seen in the context of
its moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the
Asia Pacific region in line with its Pivot to Asia policy 
Malaysia has sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, China s
most critical supply routes that transport oil and other materials
vital to its continued economic development Aside from its
strategic location, Malaysia has a booming economy that averages
around 7 percent annual growth, it is the world s third largest
exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Qatar and Indonesia,
and the country has holds over 4 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia, and Washington is
doing what it can to tip the scale in favor of the opposition after
its success in the 2008 elections In 2013, the opposition
coalition is relying on votes from those dissatisfied with the
status quo and a large demographic of young voters who want to
challenge the ruling coalition s infallibility at the polls Under
the watch of the ruling coalition, Malaysia was transformed from an
exporter of rubber and tin into a key industrial player with a
strong domestic automobile industry The ruling coalition has
overseen stable economic growth, while promising 3 3 million new
jobs in the high income sector and attracting multi million dollar
investments As critical elections loom in the country and critics
ask whether the untested opposition is able to guarantee continued
growth, voters deliberating between the ruling coalition and the
opposition will also indirectly be choosing between China and the
US The results of the upcoming election are expected to be the
closest ever, and the potential for political turbulence is at an
all time high The millions that have been funnelled to Malaysia s
opposition is proof that Washington has a regional agenda of its
own The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-opposition-politics-771/
"26 Dec, 2012",US attempting regime change in Malaysia: Fact or fiction? (Op-Ed),"As the South East Asian nation of Malaysia prepares for general elections, distrust of the political opposition and accusations of foreign interference have been major talking points in the political frequencies emanating from Kuala Lumpur The United Malays National Organization (UMNO) leads the country s ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and has maintained power since Malaysian independence in 1957 One of Malaysia s most recognizable figures is former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been credited with ushering in large scale economic growth and overseeing the nation s transition from an exporter of palm oil, tin, and other raw materials, into an industrialized economy that manufactures automobiles and electronic goods The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who once held the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mahathir s administration, but was sacked over major disagreements on how to steer Malaysia s economy during the 1997 Asian financial crisis Today, the political climate in Malaysia is highly polarized and a sense of unpredictability looms over the nation Malaysia s current leader, Prime Minister Najib Razak, has pursued a reform minded agenda by repealing authoritarian legislation of the past and dramatically loosening controls on expression and political pluralism introduced under Mahathir s tenure Najib has rolled back Malaysia s Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detention without trial, and has liberalized rules regarding the publication of books and newspapers During Malaysia s 2008 general elections, the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition experienced its worst result in decades, with the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition winning 82 parliamentary seats For the first time, the ruling party was deprived of its two thirds parliamentary majority, which is required to pass amendments to Malaysia s Federal Constitution In the run up to elections scheduled to take place before an April 2013 deadline, figures from all sides of the political spectrum are asking questions about the opposition s links to foreign funders in Washington The question of foreign funding Malaysia s former PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad has long captured the ire of officials from Washington and Tel Aviv, and though he s retired, he has channeled his energies into the Perdana Global Peace Foundation, which recently hosted an international conference in Kuala Lumpur calling for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 and has sought to investigate war crimes committed in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan Mahathir has been an ardent critic of Israel and organizations such as AIPAC, and has recently accused US based organizations the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) of holding a concealed intention to influence Malaysia s domestic politics through the funding of local NGOs and groups directly linked to Anwar Ibrahim s Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition In an article the former prime minister published in the New Straits Times, a leading mainstream newspaper, Mahathir accuses financier George Soros and his organization, the Open Society Institute, of promoting democracy ù in Eastern Europe to pave the way for colonization by global finance capital Mahathir acknowledges how OSI pumped millions into opposition movements and independent media in Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of strengthening civilsociety , only to have like minded individuals nominated by Soros s own foundation come to power in those countries The former prime minister has also pointed to how Egypt (prior to Mohamad Morsi taking power) has cracked down on NGOs affiliated with NED, namely groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and Freedom House, which are all recipients of funding from the US State Department In Malaysia, high profile NGOs and media outlets have admittedly received funding from OSI and satellite organizations of NED Premesh Chandran, the CEO of the nation s most prominent alternative media outlet, Malaysiakini, is a grantee of George Soros s Open Society Foundations and launched the news organization with a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok based Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), another organization with dubious affiliations to the US State Department Malaysiakini has come under pressure from local journalists for the lack of transparency in its financial management and hesitance in revealing the value of its shares Additionally, Suaram, an NGO promoting human rights, has borne heavy criticism over its funding and organizational structure The Companies Commission of Malaysia launched investigations into Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd, a private company linked to Suaram, and found it to be a conduit for money being used to channel funds from NED Suaram has been instrumental in legitimizing allegations of a possible cover up of the murder of a Mongolian fashion model, Altantuya Shaaribuu, who was living in Malaysia in 2006 and associated with government officials that have been linked to a kickback scandal involving the government s purchase of submarines from France Senator Ezam Mohd Nor, himself a recipient of Suaram s Human Rights Award, has accused the organization of employing poor research methods and attempting to disparage the government: Malaysians have the right to feel suspicious about them They have been making personal allegations against the Prime Minister [Najib Razak] on the murder of Altantuya and many other cases without proof their motive is very questionable especially when they are more inclined towards ridiculing and belittling the ruling government ùThe German Embassy in KL has reportedly admitted that it has provided funds to Suaram s project in 2010 Malaysia s Foreign Minister Anifah Aman followed by making strong statements to the German Ambassador and declared that Germany s actions could be viewed as interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the Open Society Institute Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton While Sreenevasan s organization claimed to be non partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations Anatomy of Malaysia s political opposition Malaysia is a multi cultural and multi religious state, and both the ruling and opposition parties attempt to represent the nation s three largest ethnic groups Approximately 60 per cent of Malaysians are either ethnic Malay or other indigenous groups and are mostly listed as Muslim, while another 25 per cent are ethnic Chinese who are predominantly Buddhist, with 7 per cent mostly Hindu Indian Malaysians The United Malays National Organization, the Malaysian Chinese Association, and the Malaysian Indian Congress head Barisan Nasional The opposition, Pakatan Rakyat, currently controls four state governments and is led by Anwar Ibrahim s Keadilan Rakyat, the Chinese led Democratic Action Party (DAP), and staunchly Islamist Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) While a large percentage of urbanites with legitimate grievances are quick to acknowledge the government s shortcomings, many are hesitant to back Anwar Ibrahim due to his connections with neo conservative thinkers in Washington and general disunity within the opposition † Ibrahim maintains close ties with senior US officials and organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy In 2005, Ibrahim chaired the Washington based Foundation for the Future, established and funded by the US Department of State at the behest of Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of then Vice President Dick Cheney, thanks in large part to his cozy relationship with Paul Wolfowitz While Ibrahim was on trial for allegedly engaging in sodomy with a male aide (of which he was acquitted sometime later), Wolfowitz and former US Vice President Al Gore authored a joint opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in support of Ibrahim, while the Washington Post published an editorial calling for consequences that would affect Malaysia s relations with Washington if Ibrahim was to be found guilty Ibrahim enraged many when he stated that he would support policy to protect the security of Israel in an interview with the Wall Street Journal; this is particularly controversial in Malaysia, where support for Palestine is largely unanimous Malaysian political scientist Dr Chandra Muzaffar writes: It is obvious that by acknowledging the primacy of Israeli security, Anwar was sending a clear message to the deep state and to Tel Aviv and Washington that he is someone that they could trust In contrast, the Najib government, in spite of its attempts to get closer to Washington, remains critical of Israeli aggression and intransigence Najib has described the Israeli government as a òserial killer and a ògangster ù Members of Barisan Nasional have addressed Ibrahim s connections to the National Endowment for Democracy in the Malaysian Parliament, including his participation in NED s òDemocracy Award event held in Washington DC in 2007 Independent journalists have uncovered letters written by Anwar Ibrahim, two of which were sent to NED President Carl Gershman in Washington DC that discussed sending an international election observer team to Malaysia and general issues related to electoral reform A third letter was sent to George Soros, expressing interest in collaborating with an accountability firm headed by Ibrahim Pakatan Rakyat s Communications Director, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, verified the authenticity of the documents This should come as little surprise, as Ibrahim s economic policies have historically aligned with institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, in contrast to Mahathir, whose protectionist economic policies opposed international financial institutions and allowed Malaysia to navigate and largely resurface from the 1997 Asian financial crisis unscathed An issue that concerns secular and non Muslim Malaysian voters is the role of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as part of the opposition In sharp contrast to the moderate brand of Islam preached by UMNO, the organization s primary objective is the founding of an Islamic state The PAS has spoken of working within the framework of Malaysia s parliamentary democracy, but holds steadfast to implementing sharia law on a national scale, which would lead to confusing implications for Malaysia s sizable non Muslim population The debate around the implementation of Islamic hudud penal code is something that other Pakatan Rakyat coalition members, such as figures in the Chinese led Democratic Action Party, have been unable to agree on The PAS enjoys support from rural Malay Muslims in conservative states such as Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu in northern Malaysia, though they have very limited appeal to urbanites While certain individuals in PAS have raised questions about NGOs receiving foreign funding, Mahathir has insinuated that PAS s leadership has been largely complicit: They [foreign interests] want to topple the government through the demonstration and Nik Aziz [Spiritual leader of PAS] said it is permissible to bring down the government in this manner They want to make Malaysia like Egypt, Tunisia, which were brought down through riots and now Syria when the government does not fall, they [Pakatan Rakyat] can appeal to the foreign power to help and bring down, even if it means using fire power ù Feasibility of òregime change narrative It must be acknowledged that the current administration led by Prime Minister Najib Razak has made great strides toward improving relations with Washington At a meeting with President Barack Obama in 2010, Najib offered Malaysia s assistance to cooperate with the United States to engage the Muslim world; Najib also expressed willingness to deploy Malaysian aid personnel to Afghanistan, and allegedly agreed on the need to maintain a unified front on Iran s nuclear program Najib has employed a Washington based public relations firm, APCO, to improve Malaysia s image in the US and has seemingly embraced American economic leadership of the region through his support for the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement Some would argue that Najib is perhaps the most pro American leader Malaysia has ever had † ì a stark contrast to the boldness of Mahathir Despite Najib having good rapport with formal Western leaders, it is clear with whom the thank tank policy architects, Zionist lobbies, and foundation fellows have placed their loyalties Sentiment among Malaysia s youth and pro democracy ù activists, who constitute a small but vocal minority, tend be entirely dismissive of the òregime change narrative, viewing it as pre election diversionary rhetoric of the ruling party While bogeymen of the Zionist variety are often invoked in Malaysian political discourse, it would be negligent to ignore the effects of Washington sponsored òdemocracy promotion in the global context, which have in recent times cloaked mercenary elements and insurgents in the colors of freedom fighting, and successfully masked geopolitical restructuring and the ushering in of neo liberal capitalism with the hip and fashionable vigor of òpeople power coups As the United States continues to militarily increase its presence in the Pacific region in line with its strategic policy shift to East Asia, policy makers in Washington would like to see compliant heads of state who will act to further American interests in the ASEAN region Let s not ignore the elephant in the room; the real purpose of America s resurgence of interest in the ASEAN bloc is to fortify the region as a counterweight against Beijing The defense ministries of Malaysia and China held a landmark defense and security consultation in September 2012, in addition to frequent bilateral state visits and enhanced economic cooperation It was the father of the current leader, Malaysia s second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, who made the landmark visit to Beijing to normalize relations in 1974, and under his son Najib, Sino Malaysian relations and cooperation have never been better Following the global economic crisis of 2008, Najib looked to Beijing to revive Malaysia s export oriented economy, emphasizing increased Chinese investment into Malaysia and expanding the base of Sino Malaysian trade in areas like education and student exchange, finance, infrastructure development, science and technology, yielding lucrative and mutually beneficial results China has been Malaysia s largest trade partner, with trade figures reaching US$90 billion in 2011; Malaysia is China s largest trading partner among ASEAN nations In asking the question of regime change in Malaysia, Dr Chandra Muzaffar reflects on Washington s moves to bolster its military muscle and dominance over the Asia Pacific region: Establishing a military base in Darwin [Australia], resurrecting the US military alliance with the Philippines, coaxing Japan to play a more overt military role in the region, instigating Vietnam to confront China over the Spratly Islands, and encouraging India to counterbalance Chinese power, are all part and parcel of the larger US agenda of encircling and containing China In pursuing this agenda, the US wants reliable allies ì not just friends ì in Asia In this regard, Malaysia is important because of its position as a littoral state with sovereign rights over the Straits of Malacca, which is one of China s most critical supply routes that transports much of the oil and other materials vital for its economic development Will the containment of China lead to a situation where the hegemon, determined to perpetuate its dominant power, seek to exercise control over the Straits in order to curb China s ascendancy? Would a trusted ally in Kuala Lumpur facilitate such control? The current Malaysian leadership does not fit the bill ù Backwards and forwards Pakatan Rakyat, the main opposition coalition pitted against the ruling party, has yet to offer a fully coherent organizational program, and if the coalition ever came to power, the disunity of its component parties and their inability to agree on fundamental policies would be enough to conjure angrier, disenchanted youth back on to the streets, in larger numbers perhaps What is ticklishly ironic about reading op eds penned by the likes of Wolfowitz and Al Gore, and how they laud Malaysia as a progressive and moderate model Islamic state, is that they concurrently demonize its leadership and dismiss them authoritarian thugs Surely, the ruling coalition has its shortcomings; the politicization of race and religion, noted cases of corrupt officials squandering funds, etc ì but far too few, especially those of the middle class who benefit most from energy subsidies, acknowledge the tremendous economic growth achieved under the current leadership and the success of their populist policies Najib s administration would do well to place greater emphasis on addressing the concerns of Malaysia s minorities who view affirmative action policies given to Malay ethnicities as disproportionate; income status, not ethnicity, should be a deciding factor in who receives assistance The current administration appears set to widen populist policies that make necessities affordable through subsidies and continue to assist low income earners with cash handouts Najib has acknowledged the need for broad reforms of Malaysia s state owned enterprises over concerns that crony capitalism may deter foreign investment; this should be rolled out concurrently with programs to foster more local entrepreneurship To put it bluntly, the opposition lacks confidence from the business community and foreign investors; even the likes of JP Morgan have issued statements of concern over an opposition win It should be noted that if Islamists ever wielded greater influence in Malaysia under an opposition coalition, one could imagine a sizable exodus of non Muslim minorities and a subsequent flight of foreign capital, putting the nation s economy in a fragile and fractured state And yet, the United States has poured millions into òdemocracy promotion efforts to strengthen the influence of NGOs that distort realities and cast doubt over the government s ability to be a coherent actor Malaysia does not have the kind of instability that warrants overt external intervention; backing regime change efforts may only go so far as supporting dissidents and groups affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim No matter the result of the upcoming elections, Najib appears to have played ball enough for Washington to remain more or less neutral According to Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan, Malaysia s electoral process is so restrictive that a mass movement like Bersih is required to purge the system of its backwardness These are curious statements, considering that the opposition gained control of four out of 13 states in 2008, including Selangor, a key economic state with the highest GDP and most developed infrastructure In response, Najib has adhered to Bersih s demands and has called for electoral reform, forming a parliamentary select committee comprising members from both Pakatan Rakyat and Barisan Nasional As elections loom, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenavasan is already dubbing them the dirtiest elections ever seen ù ì unsurprising rhetoric from a woman being handed her talking points by the US embassy Nile Bowie for RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-malaysia-regime-change-871/
