"19 Jul, 2013",'Obama can't afford a fair trial for Snowden' - Stephen Cohen,"Who s Edward Snowden more of a problem for now, Russia or the US? Has he sent US Russian relations into a tailspin or did he just reaffirm the sad state of affairs? Is the Russian Reset dead?Today we discuss the fallout from the Snowden case with Stephen Cohen, Professor of Russian Studies and History at New York University and Princeton University Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie
Shevardnadze: At this point, to whom is
Snowden more of a problem the US or Russia? Steven
Cohen:From my perspective, he is a
problem for both If we put this in historical context since the end
of the Soviet Union 22 years ago, we ve lost several opportunities
to create a meaning for cooperative relationships between Washington
and Moscow It appeared a few weeks ago that we had another
opportunity The opportunity began with a tragedy the bombings in
Boston It was later clear that there was a need for a lot of
cooperation in counter terrorism between Moscow and Washington And
then, the Syrian civil war, whatever it is, ran out of control 
it s certainly the worst crisis in the Middle East for many years 
It also appeared that Washington and Moscow were ready to do
something about it And then came Snowden Not only Snowden, but he
is clearly a setback I would say both for President Putin and
President Obama Sophie
Shevardnadze:But you say that Putin is
handling the Snowden situation wisely Steven
Cohen:What makes us really interested
is that President Putin is the man that likes to control the
environment in which he makes international and I suppose domestic
 decisions He couldn t control this Snowden came literally out
of the blue and he hadn t decided what to do So he was caught and
he remains caught between two strong countervailing factors: On the
one hand, Putin pursues in a world which I would call not an
ANTI American foreign policy, but an UN American foreign policy or a
NON American foreign policy That is, a foreign policy rather
different from the US in many areas Therefore, he could not turn in
Snowden a highly symbolic figure over to the US On the other
hand, it s absolutely clear that Putin wants some kind of
cooperative relationship with the US I think he has probably done as
good as he can do As in, the solution is to allow Snowden to remain
in Russia in some status of temporary asylum, while he sorts out how
he s going to go to a third country Venezuela or some other
place That s a legal issue He needs travel documents, and he
probably has to go to the embassy of that country in Moscow But
although it s legal, it s profoundly political In a way,
Russian American relationships hinge on that at the moment And as I
said the other day to an American who asked me, this tests the
leadership ability not only of Putin, but of Obama, to solve this
problem Sophie
Shevardnadze: You ve brought up an
interesting point saying that Putin likes to control the
situation Do you think he would have acted differently if he wasn t
confronted with the sheer fact of Snowden being in Russia? Steven
Cohen:I mean, all leaders real
leaders, state leaders try to control the environment in which they
make decisions Very often, they can t Wars come, acts of
terrorism come, and leaders change in other countries with which they
were doing business What we don t know about Snowden affair is
whether or not the Chinese, when they allowed Snowden to fly to
Moscow from Hong Kong, cleared it with the Russian end Whether the
Russians said, Okay, send him along ù If that happened and we
don t know, but I would guess it did because the Chinese Russian
relationship is very important and very close at the moment I would
assume that whoever in Moscow made that decision it might not have
been President Putin; he can t make every decision before it
becomes a crisis they may have assumed that in fact Snowden was
going to do as Snowden was going to do spend maybe ten hours in
the transit section of Sheremetyevo airport and then get on a plane
to Havana, and onwards, as he thought, to Ecuador And then, a
problem rose with Ecuador and he is still in Moscow So in that
sense, we don t know if Putin said Ok, travel through Moscow, ù
not knowing he was going to become a kind of resident in Moscow We
just don t know that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Another problem is that
his passport was cancelled so he couldn t really fly through Moscow
even if he wanted to But given the way things are right now, what
does Russia risk if it grants Snowden official refugee status? Steven
Cohen:As you know, there is a very
strong anti Kremlin, anti Putin, anti Russian lobby in Washington 
Its citadel is the US Congress That s why we get preposterous
legislation like the Magnitsky act Congress is prepared to do
anything to strike at Russia Yesterday, for example, one of the
senators proposed that the US boycott the Winter Olympics in Russia
in 2014 that won t happen but the mere fact that the US
senator, who is supposed to be a person of wisdom and dignity, would
propose such a preposterous thing shows you what kind of Congress we
are dealing with I predict and I think any idiot could predict 
that when, and I assume it s when ù Snowden gets his temporary
asylum in Moscow, the members of Congress, members of the various
anti Russian lobbies like Freedom House in the US, and many others
will denounce the Kremlin and demand that Obama does something very
bad to Russia And then Obama will be tested we will see if he
can withstand that or not That s why I say by the way, that I
think it s is a kind of test not only of the wisdom and the
leadership of Putin but the wisdom and the leadership of Obama Let
me remind you, Obama didn t ask for this Snowden crisis Putin
didn t ask for it They just got it Sophie
Shevardnadze:The media right now is
more focused on Snowden s personal life what he eats, what he
wears, where he lives, where his girlfriend is than his
revelations and the leaks Can we expect the attention to turn back
to the NSA and PRISM, or is that issue now buried under the Snowden
narrative? Steven
Cohen:You raised what for me is the
fundamental question: What should we, the Americans, be doing now?
Ever since Snowden made these revelations, there s been a big open,
public debate about whether or not we approve of these massive,
intrusive surveillance programs by American intelligence agencies 
And of course, Europe and Russia and other countries who had been
survellied have to make that decision too But first and foremost,
this is the question for Americans: Is it compatible with our
concept of democracy? Of civil liberties? Of privacy? Or, on the
other hand, do we need these kinds of abuses of civil liberties to
protect ourselves against terrorism? There are two sides of this
issue It s a complicated issue Snowden wanted to trigger a debate
and he has failed, because as you say, the drama of the personal saga
of Edward Snowden what s going to happen to him, where he is
going to go, where his girlfriend is, he looked so young all
these personal dramas [have taken the spotlight] And I would guess
that Snowden, who seems to be a very serious and purposeful man, is
himself disappointed because his purpose, as he says, and I
believe him, in making these revelations is making a conversation in
the US about these surveillance practices, which, because of his own
drama, hasn t happened yet and it may never happen And Sophie,
let me add a matter that is absolutely never discussed in the US, but
it s profound: Obama says, the US government says, the Senators
say, the Media says, Showden should come home and stand trial ù
Well, in some ways, if he could get a fair trial, if he could be out
on bail the way Daniel Elsberg was 30 years ago when he took the
Pentagon papes while he is preparing his trial, and he could tell a
story, and he could build a legal team, and he could have an
open court case with all the rights the defendants have, that means
that he could have all sorts of officials involved with this case,
right up to the vice president and the president of the US I cannot
imagine that the Obama administration or any US administration would
permit that, therefore I doubt very seriously that Obama is sincere
when he says that Showden should come home and stand trial But I
would guess that if Snowden was given these guarantees of being out
of prison and on bail and free to have an open trial he might come
home But he is not going to get those guarantees, I would guess,
because we live in a different era, here in America too Sophie
Shevardnadze: I want to talk a little
bit more about what has changed, whether the whole NSA leaks have
changed the American society Because if you talk about me and people
around me, who have a post Soviet hangover or had a Soviet
childhood these revelations weren t life changing for us, because
we suspected surveillance in some form or another Many RT viewers
are strongly against any form of surveillance, but still, I know a
lot of Americans that are around and they are not saying Hey, at
this point we re done with the government ù For example,
Larry King, he told me that he is actually siding with the government
on surveillance What do you see around you are the people still
shocked, or they are digesting and accepting it in the name of the
War on Terror? Steven
Cohen: I understand what you are saying
about your Russian colleagues surveillance is a problem in Russia
too and it has been a problem for decades And there is a debate in
the Russian media whether the FSB the Russian intelligence agency 
is doing too much or too little And let s be fair, people in
Russia and in the US are afraid of terrorism If you asked me, would
I allow the US government to listen to my phone calls and read my
email if they are going to prevent my children from being killed in a
terrorist explosion in New York City where I live, I would
undoubtedly say, Yes ù I ll just be a little more careful in
what I say on the phone and what I write in the email But this is a
major question, and times have changed I m old enough to remember
the Osborne case, when he took the Pentagon papers which documented
the Pentagon and White House line about the war in Vietnam, and then
the New York Times published them Then they were published very
quickly as a book, and Elsberg was on the radio, and on television as
it existed then He was out on bail and famous lawyers came to defend
him And in the end, he was exonerated in a way He won in the
courts That America doesn t exist anymore partly because of what
happened in 9/11, and partly because we fought so many wars Many
Americans are afraid and we have become more accustomed, decade by
decade, to this kind of surveillance So the question that Snowden
raised is, Should we become accustomed to it? Is this really a
trade off between our fears and our privacy that we want to make? ù
But I agree with you, the polls have shown I don t remember the
last number that the polls revealed but about half of Americans or
even more were okay with what the government was doing But Sophie,
you know as well as I do that when you take a public opinion poll,
you can give the answer you want by the way you ask the question If
you say in general to Americans are you prepared to give up all
your freedoms that Americans have fought for, for 200 years, and
allow the government to do this kind of possibly illegal
surveillance, a majority would say No ù But if you ask people,
 Are you prepared to permit this surveillance so that you and your
children are safe?, ù the majority is going to say Yes ù It s
just in how you ask the question and you can t ask the question
until you ve had a national discussion which we haven t had and
which the government doesn t want but what Snowden wanted But
again, until Snowden s personal drama ends, or at least calms down
and moves off the front page, we re not going to have that
discussion in our country And even then, we may not have it because
the government doesn t want it Sophie Shevardnadze:Welcome back to the show We re talking about Snowden and how his
Moscow detour can affect the already shaken relationship between
Russia and the US Our guest is Steven Cohen, professor of Russian
Studies and History Good to have you back, Steven So, in your
latest opinion editorials, you keep saying that Russia and the US are
at a hateful crossroads Is Snowden s case icing on the cake? Could
things get really bad after this? Steven
Cohen:I have a historical perspective 
Let me state it again, 22 years after the end of the Soviet Union We
do not have a good relationship with Russia Nobody asks why Rather,
in the US, when people are asked Why, ù they will say it s the
fault of Russia Now they say it s the fault of Putin But that is
not correct and certainly not a complete answer We had several
opportunities to establish partnership with Russia in international
affairs The first came in the 1990s after the end of the Soviet
Union, and Clinton with Yeltsin war set opportunities The second
opportunity came after 9/11, when Putin called President George Bush
and said We are with you, what can we do to help the US which has
been attacked by terrorism? We re partners ù That opportunity was
lost Then came Obama s so called Reset ù with then President
Medvedev, and that opportunity was lost Now, the tragic bombings in
Boston and the tragic civil war in Syria have shown Washington and
Moscow that we need a cooperative relationship and that created yet
another opportunity It s not clear whether we will seize the
opportunity with Snowden  the Magnitsky act and other events have
become obstacles on both sides to seizing these opportunities The
larger reason in my opinion which is a minority opinion in America
 is that my generation knew as the Cold War between the Soviet Union
and the US either didn t actually end with the Soviet Union, or
it s come alive again Because everything we ve seen between
Russia and America since the end of the Soviet Union looks, smells,
and behaves like a Cold War relationship It s just that in the US,
our leaders don t want to accept this failure that they lost an
opportunity in post Cold War Russia to create a new relationship, a
partnership with Russia And that s where we are today So it s a
long way to answer, but I think that historians will tell you in the
future and as a historian today, I would tell you that we can t
understand Snowden We can t understand Magnitsky We can t
understand these recent conflicts without putting them into
historical context of a relationship between America and post Soviet
Russia during the last 22 years This is a narrative that hasn t
stopped Sophie
Shevardnadze:You just demonstrated
that obstacles or opportunities to get two countries closer or get
them more apart arise all the time and these talks of the Cold
War have been around forever, or in the past 15 years You seem to be
pointing out that we are now at a hateful crossroads How much worse
are things are now than they were in the Bush Era? Because it seemed
like they were at the lowest then Steven
Cohen:The low point of the
relationship since the end of the Soviet Union was of course the war
with Georgia in 2008 And the reason that that was a low point is
that the US and Russia came close to hot war, not just Cold War 
Georgia began the war, no doubt about that Russia reacted by moving
into South Ossetia It began the fight with the Georgian army which
was, in effect, an American proxy army We created that army We
armed it We trained it There were American military advisors
somewhere in the Georgia, traveling with the Georgian troops There
was a discussion at the White House, led by Dick Cheney, that the US
should bomb the Russian army in South Ossetia Sophie
Shevardnadze:But no one stood up for
the Georgian army there because no one really wants to wage a war
with Russia That s another example of how America and Russia would
never actually go to war Steven
Cohen:I don t know about that,
Sophie Where is that written, that we would never go to war? We were
extremely close in the Cuban Missile crisis, we were extremely close
in Berlin on a number of occasions There were probably occasions
that we haven t been told about, and in my judgment we were close
in Georgia in 2008 No fault of Russia but how many times can we
avoid these dangerous possibilities? My point is, it s the duty of
leadership American leadership and Russian leadership to create
a relationship where these dangers don t appear And we haven t
done that yet And I will say as an American patriot, the primary
fault not the entire fault but the primary fault is in
Washington Until American policy toward Russia changes, things will
not get better And American policy toward Russia hasn t changed on
one fundamental issue: Washington believes in what it calls
 selective cooperation, ù which means Russia should make
concessions but Washington does not have to make concessions in
return Until that policy changes, nothing else will change I am
absolutely sure about that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Does that mean that they
don t want a better relationship with Russia? They simply don t
care enough to ameliorate their relationship with Russia? Things are
good as they are? Steven
Cohen:The American political policy
media establishment wants a good relationship with Russia once it s
on America s own terms And it s very clear what that means,
because it has meant the same thing since the Soviet Union Russia
should be a junior and subservient partner to American interests 
Whatever is in the American interest, Russia should help promote So,
if America decides to expand NATO to Russia s borders, Russia
should accept this as a very good idea to its own security If
America decides to build missile installations in Europe or on ships
that threaten Russia s nuclear security, Russia should understand
that that s really against North Korea or Iran, and it doesn t
affect Russia If the US believes that the overthrow of Assad in
Syria will bring peace to the Middle East, Russia should agree The
problem is, Russia doesn t agree Russia is a different
civilization, but the bad precedent was set I don t like to
criticize your leaders because it s your problems by Yeltsin, who
agreed almost on everything And so Washington got into a habit of
getting what it wanted But even ambassador McFaul has said on a
several occasions during the reset ù which he claims he invented,
 We re going to negotiate with Moscow, and see what they can do
to promote our national interests ù Fine but that s one hand
clapping A real negotiation, real diplomacy, is not that It is
that we go to Moscow and say Here are our interests, will you help
us? ù And then Moscow says, We might Here are our interests 
Will you help us? ù And then they do something for each other 
Washington doesn t do anything I would defy anybody who thinks I m
being unpatriotic just tell me one major concession that Moscow
has received from Washington since the end of the Soviet Union? Just
one? And when I ask this question, at all just, leading places of
the American establishment, I do get one answer: We gave them
financial loans in the 1990s ù Yeah, they were onerous loans which
only Putin, because of high oil prices, could finally pay back 
Although Washington forgave Poland s communist era debt, it never
forgave any of Moscow s debts We have never given Russia
anything By the way, Putin says that over and over and over again,
and Washington says, Why is he so anti American? He is not
anti American, he just made a very simple point that any major leader
would make that a relationship is a two way relationship: We give
something to you, you give something to us, and we go forward and
solve problems We don t have that relationship and we haven t
had it since the Soviet Union ended We had it with the Soviet Union,
but that s another story Sophie
Shevardnadze:The Reset ù idea 
is it all forgotten and dead now? Steven
Cohen:In America, it s something
that Obama s enemies use to show how unwise he is and say it
failed The reality is that Obama got what he wanted from the Reset ù
 he got Russian help in supplying NATO forces in Afghanistan He
got tougher sanctions against Iran He got Moscow s cancellation of
the C 300 defense system, I think The problem is, once again what
did Moscow get in return? Nothing They wanted a compromise on
missile defense They wanted the end of NATO expansion and an end to
American democracy promotion in Russia But Washington refused So
the Reset ù failed, Washington got what it wanted, and now we are
starting all over again The new d√©tente we used to call it
 d√©tente ù during the Cold War is going to fail unless
American policy changes It s a sad story, but it s a true story RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/snowden-case-us-russia-307/
"24 Sep, 2012",USAID looks for ways around Russian ban (Op-Ed),"Russia s Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave USAID until October 1 to shut its doors in Moscow This is an excellent decision by the Russian Government And Washington s immediate and virulent reaction only confirms that Russia is right on target The New York Times next morning on the front page cited American officials who quickly pledged to maneuver around the Kremlin ù Even before the public announcement, on Tuesday 18 September, US Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and USAID leadership met with their Russian partners Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of the Golos Association one of the top recipients of USAID funding confirmed after the meeting that the agency is not going to leave Russia completely ù and they are brainstorming ù about how to reorganize In the meantime, Ambassador McFaul announced that it will take at least a year ù for USAID to exit Russia, according to Bloomberg News Brainstorming on how circumvent the Russian government s decision instead of how to pack up faster is only one more demonstration of Washington s utter disrespect for another country s sovereignty Indeed, there are a number of ways in which USAID can maneuver around its predicament Funding can be channeled directly from USAID headquarters in Washington to its Russian beneficiaries no need to go through a Moscow office USAID funding can be redirected through a great number of other US institutions, beginning with the National Endowment for Democracy and its four mandated institutes; private funds such as MacArthur, Soros s Open Society Institute, or Freedom House; universities Russia programs, etc To hide the American connection, USAID can channel funding through their partners in Ukraine, Poland or Georgia for their very active operations in the Caucuses; in this case the money entering Russia will be Ukrainian, Polish or, God forbid, Saakashvili s In October last year, USAID signed an agreement with Cisco Systems on joint 50/50 funding of Cisco Networking Academies for Public Service Program Cisco and other major US corporations may continue running USAID programs A year ago Michael McFaul announced an initiative to create a new US$50 million fund, essentially an endowment for a private foundation established under Russian law for Russian civilsociety groups Washington may use any combination of these and other possibilities One way to put an end to USAID activities in Russia is not only to close their Moscow office, but to insist on shutting down all USAID programs and funding for Russia This is American taxpayers money give it back to the American people, use it to help them pay mortgages instead of throwing families out of their homes Obviously, USAID cannot be allowed to stay in Moscow beyond the set date This delay will only serve to build up additional infrastructure people and organizations to run operations remotely The main lament of the Western press has been about how hard USAID closure will hit the sick, disabled, mothers, newborns and other children that the agency helps Well, let s take a look at USAID leadership to see how well they are suited for healthcare services Director of USAID/Russia Charles North, according to its official biography is a 2004 graduate of the National War College, with an MS Degree in National Security Strategy ù †Earlier North served as Senior Deputy Director of USAID s Afghanistan and Pakistan Task Force, and helped launch a presidential initiative to support Mexico and Central America in battling organized crime and drug trafficking In Washington, Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia until last year was Douglas Menarchik: a 26 year career US Air Force officer, Vietnam veteran with 211 combat missions, assistant for terrorism policy at the Pentagon, where he developed the Defense Department s Strategic Plan for Combating Terrorism, military advisor to the vice president of the United States with a portfolio including terrorism and low intensity conflict Earlier Menarchik was instructor at the Air Force Special Operations School, teaching combating terrorism and counter insurgency But that s not all If you check Charles North s bio on USAID site, you will see a new updated ù version that excludes his National War College stint However, a cached copy of his true biography is still available and this snapshot shows the page as it appeared on September 14, 2012 Someone was cleaning house a few days before the public announcement Enough tales about healthcare dispensed by US military and national security cadre USAID out Russia must take care of its own civilsociety, ill and disabled by itself instead of outsourcing it to Washington Russia s shutting USAID operations is also an excellent example for any other country where USAID operatives still work on winning hearts and minds ù of the local population Veronika Krasheninnikova, Director General of the Institute for Foreign Policy Research and Initiatives in Moscow, for RT",https://www.rt.com/russia/usaid-security-russia-ngo-848/

"20 Apr, 2012",Post-election Russia: Putin‚Äôs new ideology,"Russia s instability, emphasized by the recent elections, has prompted an elaborate political transformation Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes Vladimir Putin s top priority as president should be to adopt a new state ideology In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view Russia s recent parliamentary and presidential elections took place amidst a deepening global economic crisis, and were characterized by growing unrest in some of Russia s regions The rising social and political tension culminated in mass street protests in Moscow and St Petersburg throughout the past winter This invites a question as to what the Russian government should do to promote reconciliation and consolidation within Russian society, and to enhance its own legitimacy To this end, it would be advisable for Russia to embrace a new state ideology based on three pillars: Spirituality, Greatness and Dignity Such a move seems all the more desirable, since the recent presidential election was marked by blatant attempts at influencing Russian politics by foreign powers, with the United States and Britain openly backing diehard anti Putin opposition in Russia, and US Ambassador Michael McFaul holding regular meetings with opposition leaders in Moscow Numerous developments in recent years (2008 î2012) indicate that the world has entered a period of profound political, economic, financial and ideological transformation As social and economic challenges mount in Europe and the United States, the globalist world order is increasingly shifting toward the unashamed use of controlled chaos ù strategies This attitude had its heyday in Libya, where NATO set a malicious precedent for brazenly intervening in the domestic affairs of a sovereign nation, invading it and deliberately sowing chaos for years to come Today, the alliance is pursuing a similar policy in Syria What nation will it choose to invade next? Could it be China, or India, or Russia?The escalating violence in Syria provided a rather compelling background for Russia s presidential race this year The recent campaign was exceptionally difficult and stressful for Vladimir Putin, but he still scored a sweeping victory at the end of the day, thanks to the tens of millions of truly patriotic voters Putin s electoral triumph signifies Russia s victory in countering a foreign media aggression It means that Russia s consolidated forces of reason have effectively prevented a British led scenario for crippling Russia, February 1917 style However, the media warfare carries on That suggests a key priority for Russia s newly elected president, which is to promote the nation s spiritual development while maintaining stability, securing the state and the public against a global crisis in a situation of profound change in the global architecture Russia s spiritual progress would encourage positive change worldwide A spiritual Russia is capable of accommodating all the basic human and social values, such as justice, patriotism, diversity, etc Mass media and ideology are admittedly the weakest spots of modern day Russia s statehood A number of Russia s public institutions and practices apparently beg to be reformed in the nearest future, and proper interaction between the state and civilsociety is a desperate necessity All the more so since the recent election has demonstrated that Vladimir Putin and his policies no longer enjoy the kind of popular support they had some five or 10 years ago In this situation, the Russian government should adjust some of its policies, as well as propose a national agenda to the public, as in a set of underlying values in charting the nation s strategic development goals Such a national agenda should draw a nationwide discussion, enjoy extensive media coverage and ideological promotion, and be finalized through an all Russian Representative Assembly Vladimir Putin could announce the convocation of such an assembly while paying tribute to Kuzma Minin s monument in Nizhny Nogorod on 4 November 2012, scheduling the meeting for 7 January 2013 A new Russia could find its major national symbols in the great personalities of the past, such as Aleksandr Nevsky, Reverend Sergius of Radonezh and Reverend Seraphim of Sarov, scientist and educator Mikhail Lomonosov, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, poet Aleksandr Pushkin, writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, chemist Dmitry Mendeleev, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, etc Nationwide reforms need to be carefully deliberated and planned, and then implemented swiftly and decisively Among the top priorities, all branches of power should engage every civilsociety institution and every political party in discussion over the essence of the much needed change with regard to mass media and ideology To that end, expert analysis will be indispensable Successful examples of such crucial deliberation in the middle of a crisis can be found in world history, including Russia s own history Nizhny Novgorod citizen Kuzma Minin spearheaded a historic process of national consolidation and revival that enabled Russia to resurge from the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century That why it is so important to analyze the historic experience of the all Russian Representative Assembly of 1613 †A comprehensive, nationwide public discussion on a new national agenda to be finalized by a Representative Assembly could enable Russia to overcome disunity and endure the looming political crisis Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-putin-ideology-panarin-535/
"9 Feb, 2012",Comparing Oranges‚Ä¶,"Pro Kremlin politicians and pundits explain the recent mass protests as an Orange Revolution ù conspiracy orchestrated by the West Member of the Russian Public Chamber Nikolay Svanidze believes the allegations are a hoax to demonize the opposition In the article below, historian and analyst Nikolay Svanidze explains his view One of the wings of Russia s political spectrum appears to be constantly dominated by hysteria, blaming every instance of public discontent on machinations by the US Department of State A number of parties and politicians are back to the habit of spotting American spy games behind everything This has become the favorite and most commonly employed argument for those backing the Putin government, culminating in a pro Putin rally at the Poklonnaya Hill memorial park on February 4, where speechmakers were getting out of breath stigmatizing the Orange plague ù Sadly, the government itself eagerly relies on this type of supporters Vladimir Putin, for one, has publicly endorsed the Poklonnaya Hill rally Many pro government pundits and observers have rushed to announce a change of tide, ù claiming that pro government rallies are attracting several times more people than opposition protests However, that is an acute case of wishful thinking It is common notion in Russia that official appraisals of rallies strength are notoriously biased, overstating the turnout at pro government events and downplaying protest attendance numbers several times over In fact, the word opposition ù is not really legitimate in this context, as the rallies that attracted tens of thousands of people in Moscow and other cities last December and last week were mainly attended by regular citizens who feel that the existing system of governance deprives them of their civil and political rights It was after Prime Minister Putin denounced the protests and their participants using his rather characteristic choice of derogatory speech that the protest movement indeed turned oppositional Whereas the initial December protests merely demanded that Head of the Central Election Commission Vladimir Churov should resign on account of election fraud, Putin s explicit contempt for the discontented made him the prime target of public scorn As for the two simultaneous and directly antagonistic rallies that took place in Moscow on 4 February 2012, they are hardly comparable While both events were attended by upwards of 100,000 people each, there was a striking difference as regards content While the opposition protest that re assembled at Bolotnaya Square on February 4 had its clearly defined messages and demands, the pro government rally at Poklonnaya Hill had but one purpose: to stick it ù to the Bolotnaya crowd The Poklonnaya meeting was merely a reaction to the Bolotnaya protests, its speakers and slogans being evidently focused on pinning an Orange Revolution ù accusation on the protest movement Another thing that revealed how these two events were a world apart was organization Those at Bolotnaya Square came by their own free will, every activist and organizer being a volunteer Of the thousands who made up the crowd at Poklonnaya Hill, the majority were either paid to show up or intimidated into participation by their employers or other authorities I would not rule out that there were also people who came to the memorial park out of their sincere confidence in Vladimir Putin, but numerous reports and revelations show that the rally owed its formidable numbers to administrative mobilization and none of the official rebuttals have so far effectively proved the opposite I have to give credit to the Kremlin s own political consultants, though: staging street action to juxtapose it to an opposition rally was tactically a smart idea However, strategically it is a terribly hazardous gamble, for you effectively pit one part of the populace against another Presenting political opposition as a bunch of unpatriotic upper middle class rascals who deserve to be stomped upon by the good common folk is not only dirty, but also suicidal In whipping up hysteria over a fictional revolution, you risk instigating a very real civil war In a highly stratified and diverse society such as Russia, the Kremlin s current divide and conquer tactics may turn out to be a Pandora s Box But back to the notorious Orange Revolution ù speculation Fingering the world s biggest and most ambitious power as the mastermind behind all things evil has repeatedly proved a highly efficient argument among a certain share of Russian society used to the Cold War era reality of the United States being our country s principal adversary Not to mention the perennial trick of finding a foreign enemy to blame for domestic policy failures But let us take a sober look at the global chess board Is Russia challenging the US to global supremacy? Have we been gearing up for war with America? Do they have a reason to perceive us as a threat to be neutralized? If not, then why on Earth would the Americans, tied up as they are with an unwinnable war, a severe economic downturn and social unrest at home, commit so much effort to overthrowing a Russian leader whose trumpeted opposition ù to them has been little more than rhetoric? A popular argument in favor of the Orange conspiracy ù theory is the Ukrainian experience While American influence is admittedly presumed behind the Kiev street protests that propelled a pro Western government into power in 2004, the political situation in today s Russia is only superficially comparable to that in Ukraine seven years back, while its is crucially different in essence In similarity to several post Soviet states, there is a powerful anti Russian sentiment in Ukraine that can be played as a mighty trump card by anyone who wants to rally support for their agenda or political ambition which is exactly what the Ukrainian liberal opposition did In Russia s case, it is not the opposition stirring enmity against a fictional foreign nemesis to impress the public, is it? Secondly, whereas both Ukraine and Georgia had distinct liberal posterboy politicians who enjoyed wide popularity as well as good standing with Western embassies, there is presently NOT A SINGLE liberal politician in Russia who could boast any significant public support Each and every liberal politician in this country is notoriously mistrusted and scorned, and even the recent multi thousand strong street protests explicitly positioned themselves as a no leader movement Should the White House indeed entertain a notion of spinning a prot√©g√© into presidency in Russia, which personality could they possibly spin?Finally, the liberals in the United States might indeed be happy with the prospect of having a more like minded, liberal administration in Moscow to deal with But what are the odds of such a liberal democratic government seizing and keeping power through a revolution in a country like Russia?

"20 Dec, 2011",Michael McFaul and Russia‚Äôs Presidential Election,"Michael McFaul was appointed US Ambassador to Russia on 17 December 2011 Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes the new ambassador is likely to try to influence Russia s upcoming presidential election In the article below, Panarin explains his view Michael McFaul is a Stanford graduate with a Ph D in international relations from Oxford University He first visited Russia in 1983 and stayed for some time while studying for his Ph D at Oxford McFaul went on to spend several years living in Russia in the 1990s, working for the Carnegie Moscow Center President Obama s nomination of McFaul to serve as the US Ambassador to Moscow became public in May this year At the time, McFaul was Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs for the US National Security Council McFaul s candidacy was submitted to Congress for endorsement in September He would have started his work in Moscow as early as November 2011, during the final stages of Russia s recent parliamentary election, if not for the Republican Party, which barred his appointment twice for partisan reasons as it tried to gain an edge in the 2012 presidential campaign which is just heating up in the United States It was therefore due to the GOP s stubborn opposition that McFaul was unable to communicate the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s critical attitude vis √† vis the Russian election to the leaders of Russia s so called extra systemic ù opposition during the December protests in Moscow In fact, Mr McFaul himself must have a thing or two to say about Russia s democracy, being one of America s most prominent experts on Russia McFaul speaks fluent Russian and has authored and edited over 20 books on democratic governance A joint McFaul Surkov working group on civilsociety [ Vladislav Surkov has held the post of first deputy of the Presidential Administration since 2008 and is believed to be one of the most influential politicians in Russia and the main architect of the country s current political system † RT ] was set up in July 2009 through a joint decree by the Russian and US presidents In this capacity, McFaul had an extensive opportunity to meet Russian human rights advocates, opposition leaders and prominent press people In 2002, McFaul founded a Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford University He is still among the Center s faculty today, which is why it was especially interesting for me to visit the Center in late November this year and discuss prospects for US Russia relations post 2012 with its leading analysts It should be noted that the political school of thought created by Michael McFaul looks very impressive, as it comprises foreign policy professionals and reputed experts on Russia and the post Soviet space McFaul s team of experts is proficient in using political technologies and PR strategies, and it shares a strong focus on promoting democracy ù in Russia These policy makers have developed their own vision of what democracy should be like in Russia, and are ready to offer their recipes to Russia s liberal opposition but in a soft and subtle way As soon as Russia was through with its parliamentary election this December, a number of American and British news outlets launched a media offensive against it As part of the smear campaign, FOX News ran footage of the Greek riots featuring arson and looting for several days, trying to pass it off as Moscow s post election protests One should expect that McFaul s arrival in Moscow is bound to increase the media pressure on Russia s leaders, since the American and British political elites are keen on preventing Vladimir Putin from assuming office for another term It is only the tactics that are likely to change with McFaul as ambassador McFaul is aware of the Russian extra systemic ù opposition s major advantages and downsides He earlier contributed to the creation of a network of Western funded NGOs in Russia This makes him a highly efficient advisor when it comes to promoting democracy ù in Russia In the meantime, there are plenty of human rights activists in Russia who are ready and waiting to upload sensational ù footage of alleged electoral fraud on the Internet in order to discredit Russia s upcoming presidential election New political technologies have been successfully tested during the recent unrest in the Middle East What Professor McFaul is going to do now is fine tune them to the Russian situation and to the presidential election campaign in particular We can expect Michael McFaul to make his big move as early as late January 2012 Is the Russian government ready for this?

"20 Jan, 2011",US snubbed Russian opposition pleas for help,"Russian opposition leaders and human rights activists pleaded with top US officials to support their plans for political and social change, but the request was apparently given short shrift by Washington Russia s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, which obtained fresh files from WikiLeaks, reports that the group was consistently critical of the Kremlin and wanted American help for reform The members of the opposition accused the US leadership of turning a blind eye to observance of human rights in Russia while at the same time seeking financial aid from America and even demanding US ideological involvement in their activities Those demands were voiced on a visit to Moscow by Michael McFaul, Special Assistant to The President for National Security Affairs and senior director of Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the United States National Security Council He met with opposition leaders at the residence of the American envoy to Russia in Moscow Read Gleb Pavlovsky on the issue here The opposition asked the US to be more critical of civil rights violations taking place in Russia, but not Bush like critical ù Those who were present at such meetings at the US embassy in Moscow also showed some evolution of their opinions over the years Previously, during George W Bush s presidency, they asked the US for softer criticism towards Russia, but these days it is a different story They seem to believe that there is a lack of harsh critics of Russian policies on America s part They even proposed discussing Russia s internal affairs in the format of representatives from the Russian and American governments and Russian NGOs, but Michael McFaul rejected the idea According to the reports, the opposition said: Washington should pay more attention to significant incidents related to freedom of assembly in Russia To solve problems in Russia s civic society, parties should sit down at the negotiation table † both Russian and US governments, and representatives from NGOs ùThe US response was, It is up to Russian activists to build up their relations with their administration, without relying on America ùLeaders of the Russian opposition also believe that the recent reset of Russia US relations has had a negative influence on human rights in Russia Activists, especially in the North Caucasus, have been saying that after the murder of Natalya Estemirova in 2009 the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, was given a carte blanche for other murders ù and should be recognized as a persona non grata by the US Michael McFaul answered that he does not see that happening and said the US would never turn a blind eye on human rights violations in domestic issues in Russia and would express its concerns out loud The report prepared by John Beyrle, the American ambassador to Russia, concluded that the opposition in Russia is unsustainable and immature He also reported that some members of the opposition asked for American help in registering new political parties The ambassador also reported that the opposition sees the possibility of Vladimir Putin once again running for presidency as the biggest threat to Russia US relations and that America should be involved to prevent that from happening Michael McFaul rejected the idea of American involvement in such activities altogether Oppostion: To further improve relations between Russia and the US, the Obama administration has ostensibly refrained from vocal support for democratic reform ùUS: civilsociety activists in Russia are unaware of the contours of the US approach to human rights and its record of public statements and speeches Russia s democrats remain in near terminal disarray † constant personality disputes, disagreements with the Kremlin, differences over the viability of political activity ùIn his report to Washington, ambassador John Beyrle proposed that the US should make its position on human rights issues and democracy in Russia more clear to the members of the Russian opposition and explain to what extent the US is willing to be involved in Russia s domestic issues Michel Chossudovsky from the Center for Research on Globalization said it is no surprise that Russian opposition parties come knocking on the door of the US embassy The involvement of US officials with opposition parties against the Russian government should come as no surprise The Russian government is a government which states its point of view If the United States doesn t like this point of view, it will attempt to weaken or destabilize the existing government or [push for] regime change as it has in countries around the world And how does it undertake regime change?They establish links with opposition political parties, and of course these opposition groups are often financed directly by US foundations, including the National Endowment for Democracy and Freedom House The National Endowment for Democracy is really an outgrowth of the CIA ù John Laughland, director of studies at the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation, believes that the parliamentary opposition in Russia does not have enough support in the country and that is why they are seeking help elsewhere [WikiLeaks] documents show frustration on the part of these groups with the new Obama foreign policy † the reset, ù he said These opposition leaders and NGO leaders are going to the Americans and saying that they don t feel the denunciation is active enough They are the ones asking for more and the Americans, in these documents at least, are being slightly reserved and saying that in fact they are already doing as much as they can ù Investigative journalist Webster Tarpley believes that the Russian opposition needs to retool, to get some actual positive ideas, and not simply be the long arm ù of a foreign power You look at that opposition and you seem to think, what do they stand for? They seem to be a group of people who are only united by their hatred of Prime Minister Putin De Putinization is the only thing they have to offer They seem to wait around for murders to occur and then blame it on Putin a kind of knee jerk reaction, ù he said I don t see an economic program, I don t see anything constructive, I don t see anything that could help the future of a great nation So therefore I don t see why people would be interested ",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-rights-human/
"28 Jan, 2010","ROAR: Russia, US open ‚Äúa channel for exchange of democratic values‚Äù","The civilsociety working group within the Russian US joint presidential commission has gathered for the first time in Washington to discuss corruption, crimes against children and negative stereotypes The participants of the group, which was established during US President Barack Obama s visit to Moscow in July last year, are entitled to discuss more topics in the future On the whole, the presidential commission comprises 13 working groups covering different areas of cooperation In one of its first moves during the meeting on January 27, the group concludedan agreement with Transparency Internationalabout cooperation for monitoring corruption level in Russia and the US The participants of the meeting also discussed the protection of children s rights, issues of adoption and fighting child pornography The commission has achieved significant progress, Russian Presidential Ombudsman for Children Pavel Astakhov believes Unfortunately, neither Russia nor America can boast of high standards in protecting children s rights, ù Astakhov was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying The level of crime against children is high in both countries, he said Moscow is interested in using the US experience in controlling people who have committed crimes against children, the ombudsman said And Russia may share its experience with the Americans in the issue of adopting children, he added Non commercial organizations may help in tracking the fate of adopted children, because very often obligatory annual reports on a child s life are not submitted to the country from which he or she was adopted, ù Astakhov said The commission also discussed stereotypes about both Russia and the US These stereotypes have existed for a long time, Russian human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin said They affect in a negative way the relations between our citizens, and, mainly, the relations between the states, ù he stressed A special report on this issue had been prepared in Russia, in which the dynamics of such stereotypes is being tracked, ù Lukin said According to him, the report demonstrates that on the whole Russians have positive attitudes towards ordinary Americans and view the activities of the US state rather negatively At the same time, Russian Deputy Presidential Chief of Staff Vladislav Surkov, a co chairman of the commission, said prior to the meeting in Washington that the countries were not going to lecture each other ù Some Russian human rights activists have criticized Surkov appointment, and 71 US congressmen, mainly Republicans, asked Obama to boycott the civilsociety working group until Moscow replaced the Russia s co chair In an interview, Surkov responded by saying that everyone is entitled to their own opinion ù He described the criticism as a small part of a larger mass of misconceptions ù It was not surprising that the first official meeting of the civilsociety working group has drawn disproportionately great interest from mass media, ù said Maksim Minaev of the Center for Political Conjuncture For the first time in modern history of the bilateral relations the presidents of the US and Russia have decided to start a direct intergovernmental dialogue on the issues of social and political cooperation, ù he noted The vector of developing this dialogue will be determined by representatives of state organs without essential non governmental mediation, which is often counterproductive in such cases, ù the analyst stressed The working group is able to become a channel for exchange of democratic values, ù Minaev said, adding that the US co chair of the group, presidential aide Michael McFaul, has sounded a new understanding by Washington of the principles of the international order ù Its cornerstone is the state sovereignty † indefeasible right of every country to defend its borders, as well as pursuing independent internal and foreign policies, ù Minaev said Surkov floated the idea of sovereign democracy ù in 2006 When Surkov and McFaul met, they exchanged jokes, a source in the commission told Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily McFaul said there had been an ambiguous reaction in the US to Surkov s appointment as a co chair The Russian deputy presidential chief of staff allegedly replied that McFaul s appointment had gone unnoticed at all in Russia because nobody knows him there, ù the daily said However, at thelast session of the presidential Council for civilsociety Institutions and Human Rightson November 23 activists assessed positively the activities of the working group on developing legislation on non commercial organizations, which is headed by Surkov, ù the paper said Human rights activists have recognized that the law has become much more loyal to such organizations, ù the daily said Many observers concentrate their attention on Surkov s figure rather than on the working group s agenda, believes political analyst Tatyana Stanovaya Against a background of the reset, in the framework of which the US officially refuse to criticize Russia in the sphere of democracy and human rights, the creation [of the group] had to become a less painful means of cooperation for Russia, ù she wrote on Politcom ru website The US administration had received the opportunity to keep the issue of human rights on the agenda of the bilateral relations (to be able to respond to criticism inside the US), and Russia had agreed to conduct manageable and bilateral discussion of these topics, ù Stanovaya said Moscow and Washington also agreed that officials will be the permanent participants of the working group This is quite understandable, the analyst said, otherwise, the American side would deal with loyal human rights activists, which makes the initial idea senseless ù Many liberals and human rights activists in Russia also criticized the US for agreeing to have Surkov as co chair of the group, the analyst said But if the decision has been taken [by the US] not to criticize but to discuss, then it would be wiser to deal with someone who is really responsible for this sphere, ù she added The compromise version of the working group generates understandable risks ùbecause it will solve simultaneously both diplomatic and human rights tasks, ù Stanovaya said It is not quite clear yet if the group has been created for channeling discussions of unpleasant issues for the Kremlin to further the reset, or for direct promoting human rights topics, ù she said The balance between these tasks is expected to be flexible and will depend on the overall character of the bilateral relations, ù Stanovaya believes In case of problems with the reset, increasing criticism of the Obama administration inside the US and the absence of progress during the talks on strategic offensive arms, the working group may still turn into a platform for lecturing Russia, ù she said And this, in turn, may question the future existence of the group, ù the analyst said, adding, however, that this is the worst possible scenario ù In the conditions of keeping relatively favorable character of the bilateral relations, ù the work of the group will be stable enough, she said Sergey Borisov",https://www.rt.com/russia/roar-russia-us-open/

Malashenko from the Carnegie Moscow Center Barack Obama is enthusiastic about changing the world, ùhe wrote in Kommersant daily Clinton is absolutely different ùfrom Obama because she is by origin from the Soviet American epoch, ùMalashenko said However, Clinton understands post Soviet politicians well and may deal with them openly enough, ùthe analyst added She may be closer psychologically to [Prime Minister] Vladimir Putin and [Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov than to her immediate chief whose competitor she was at the election, ùMalashenko went on to say The talks between Clinton and the Russian leadership will show to what extent Obama s populism is in harmony with pragmatism and conservatism of Washington s veterans, ùhe said Argumenty i Facty weekly, in turn, asks if Clinton is trying to achieve the same influence in the US as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice did It was not difficult to shine against the background of George Bush, but Obama s star, crowned by the Nobel Committee, is so bright now that all successes in foreign policy are attributed to him, not to the Secretary of State, ùthe weekly said The visit to Moscow is the first serious test ùfor Clinton and her chance to confirm by real actions her ambitions, the paper said But with all their smiles, Clinton and her spouse Bill have not had special sympathies to Russia, the weekly added In this regard, Barack Obama seems the more perspective partner in talks, more so because he easily finds an understanding with Dmitry Medvedev, ùArgumenty i Facty said Russian diplomacy is likely to address Obama after finding Hillary s incompliance, ùthe paper added Maksim Minaev, analyst at the Center for Political Conjuncture, called Clinton s visit a tactical move ùin the development of the process of resetting relations between Russia and US The issues that Clinton will discuss in Moscow have already been raised in the dialogue between the two countries leaders in July during Obama s visit, he added Now, the Secretary of State and her department do not play a strategic role in determining Washington s policies toward Russia, ùthe analyst stressed This role belongs to the White House s staff and National Security council, he added However, many Russian observers really expect Clinton to make breakthroughs ùin Moscow One of the main issues that are being discussed is a new document that should replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 1) Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has expressed hope that the new treaty will be developed by December, when the old one expires Also, on the eve of the secretary s visit, Russian US consultations started in Moscow on a range of issues, including missile defense The talks should confirm that resetting relations started by the presidents of the two countries is continuing successfully, ùKommersant daily said The US administration floated new ideas ùduring these discussions, the paper said, calling them the results of recent talks between Russian and US presidents in New York ùAmerican experts showed concrete details of the approach of Barack Obama s administration to missile defense, the paper said Clinton is also expected to propose to Russia the building of a joint missile defense system Kommersant quoted Michael McFaul, the US president s Special Assistant for National Security and Russian and Eurasian affairs, as saying that the main result of meetings between the Russian and US presidents was that the missile defense system should be created together with Russia ù Citing the US president s assistant, the paper also wrote that Washington was not going to include Ukraine in its plans on the new missile defense system Vedomosti daily wrote that Russia s priority at the talks was the preparation of the new treaty on strategic arms reduction In July, the presidents of Russia and the US agreed to limit the number of warheads in the range of 500 1100, ùthe paper said Moscow is insisting on the lower level, and Washington the higher, ùthe paper added During Clinton s visit the two sides may come to an agreement about a compromise variant, the paper said, adding that analysts assume that the level will be limited to 800 warheads ù At the same time, observers say that Moscow will continue to link the talks on strategic arms reduction to US plans on missile defense Vedomosti quoted an anonymous source in the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying that offensive arms and missile defense are the two sides of one medal ù For the US the main topic of the talks in Moscow will be Iran, Vedomosti said Clinton s task is to enlist Russia s support in the issue of sanctions against Iran in case the negotiations on Tehran s nuclear program are not successful, ùthe paper said Clinton is also scheduled to meet with Russian students and representatives of civilsociety and to visit the city of Kazan The US Secretary of State will also discuss in Moscow the work of the bilateral presidential commission This work is not very active on topics that are not of paramount importance, Pavel Zolotarev, deputy director of the USA and Canada Institute noted One should understand that there is no basis for a many sided development of Russian US relations, even economic ties are weak, ùZolotarev told Gazeta ru website One of the key groups of the commission is one on the development of civilsociety This issue was also discussed during the talks that started on the eve of Clinton s visit to Russia Washington is likely to stop criticizing Russia s sovereign democracy, ù Kommersant said To confirm this, the paper quoted McFaul as saying that the reset of relations includes the problems of human rights Mr MacFaul made it clear that the US no longer intends to teach Russia about democracy, provoking Moscow s irritation, and instead wants to concentrate on practical work with non governmental organizations, ùthe paper said This actually means abandoning the policies of previous US administrations that always publicly criticized the situation with human rights in Russia, ùthe paper said However, Clinton will meet with representatives of civilsociety and human rights activists Some observers think that the US is ready to support the Russian leadership to gain geopolitical concessions, first of all in the Iran issue In any event, the only important disagreement ùbetween Moscow and Washington is Georgia s boundaries ùafter the 2008 war over South Ossetia, Kommersant wrote According to the paper, McFaul said that the US would not emphasize this
