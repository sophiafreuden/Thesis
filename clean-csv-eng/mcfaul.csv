"31 Dec, 2019",Joe Biden's man shows the world why US policy towards Russia has completely failed,"It s entirely possible that Joe Biden could be the next US President If so, buckle your seatbelts because the advice he s getting on Russia is, almost certainly, dangerously wrong Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Regular readers will know of my deep scorn for Russia Watchers ù † Westerners who, as a rule, purport to have an understanding of the country beyond their actual competence Sadly, they are an unavoidable hazard on this beat, much as snow is to Siberia, or blazing summer sun to Krasnodar For the most part they are more of an amusement than a menace, self important but not remotely influential such as Molly McKew, Mark Galeotti and Malcolm Nance Safely ensconced on the punditry circuit, or Think Tank racket, where they can, thankfully, do little real harm However, problems start when they gain the ear of policymakers Probably the best example being Michael McFaul, who even managed to land the US ambassador s gig in Moscow, under Barack Obama Once landed in the Russian capital, he then proceeded to scorch all around him: like a toddler let loose with a box of matches at a fireworks shop It s notable that since his disastrous term and bear in mind some elements in Russia clearly worked to undermine his endeavours † Washington has appointed experienced, and competent, diplomats Michael Carpenter is another illustration of what happens when an inept gibberish babbler is let loose in the corridors of power A small potato who has somehow risen, without a trace, to be regarded as a Russia expert in Washington And the fact he s acquired this status serves to expose the corrosion of American foreign policy expertise It also shines some light upon why US officials continue to get Russia wrong, by underestimating its abilities, misunderstanding its concerns and confusing its intentions Remember Barack Obama s line about Russia being no more than a regional power † and John McCain s insistence that it was a gas station masquerading as a country? Both delivered before Moscow helped to upend US plans for Syria Fast forward to today and Western media isworriedabout growing Russian influence inAfrica Carpenter is a policy advisor at the Penn Biden Centre, ù the Think Tank of the former US Vice President Although he tends to come across more as a propagandist Which is presumably why he s also employed as a lobbyist/fellow at NATO s Atlantic Council adjunct According to his ownbiography, which I am copy/pasting verbatim: Carpenter previously served in the Pentagon as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense with responsibility for Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia, the Balkans, and Conventional Arms Control He also served in the White House as a foreign policy advisor to Vice President Joe Biden as well as on the National Security Council as Director for Russia † Previously, Dr Carpenter was a career Foreign Service Officer with the State Department ù So, in other words, this man had a lot of influence And he s presumably being kept in a sort of cold storage until the Democrats reassume control of the White House (perhaps under Biden himself), and he can spend another few years misinforming power brokers Just before New Year 2018, he posted a Twitter Thread, which began I ve been asked what I expect from Russia in 2019 Here s my top 10 list of events to watch out for (not in any particular order of probability) ù Carpenter kept it pinned to his profile throughout the year Only removing it a few days ago Given how it turned out, I initially thought it was remarkable chutzpah But, upon reflection, it s clear Carpenter meant it as a f*ck you ù to real experts, because, as a system insider, he knows Washington is no longer interested in substance when it comes to Russia Today, we are a long way from George Kennan Here is what Biden s man predicted #1 A military incursion into Ukraine The most likely target is the canal that feeds fresh water from the Dnieper river to Crimea Without this water, Crimea s agricultural sector goes under Also look for Russia to seek complete dominance over the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait 1) A military incursion into Ukraine The most likely target is the canal that feeds freshwater from the Dnieper river to Crimea Without this water, Crimea s agricultural sector goes under Also, look for Russia to seek complete dominance over the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait ù None of this happened Instead, Moscow Kiev relations thawed slightly under new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 2) A military flare up in Nagorno Karabakh if Prime Minister Pashinyan does not cater to corrupt Russian interests in Armenia ù This region was quiet in 2019 And Russia maintains good relations with both Azerbaijan and Armenia 3) Pressure on President Lukashenka (sic) to allow Russia to build a military base in Belarus, especially if the US green lights the construction of Fort Trump in Poland If Minsk resists, the Kremlin will be prepared to execute an Anschluss operation ù Russia did not invade Belarus and made no attempt to build an armed forces base in the country Minsk previously, in 2018, rejected the notion of a joint air facility on its territory, described as an unpleasant episode, ù by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Not quite the language of war 4) Russia and Iran take control of eastern Syria as the US withdraws and Turkey engages in cross border attacks on Kurdish fighters Over time this guarantees that disenfranchised Sunni Arabs radicalize into ISIS 2 0 I m no Middle East expert, and unlike Carpenter I don t pretend to be, but I know the Americans haven t withdrawn and ISIS 2 0 hasn t shown up 5) A growing Russian military presence in Libya helps General Haftar consolidate control of the country, which becomes a Russian protectorate Again I don t know much about Libya, but I think I d have heard if it became a Russian protectorate ù 6) Moscow arms the Taliban with more sophisticated weapons as the US draws down its forces and the NATO ISAF mission is stretched to the breaking point Moscow displaces the US as the chief power broker in Afghanistan and the Taliban comes back to power None of this came to pass 7) Moscow supports Bosnian President Milorad Dodik s efforts to separate Republika Srpska from the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, risking a renewed ethnic conflict in the Balkans There have been no credible reports suggesting this happened And Bosnia formed a government, onlylast week, after a 14 month impasse No easy task given agreement is required between Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Muslim Bosniaks 8) The Russian Saudi relationship blossoms as Moscow sends more weapons to Saudi Arabia and coordinates further oil supply cuts This is the only prediction you could say Carpenter got half right Oil supply coordination did continue (but that was pretty obviously going to happen) Nevertheless, there were no new weapons deals hatched 9) EU sanctions on Russia fall apart as one of the EU member states breaks consensus in return for an undisclosed energy deal with Russia The most likely candidates: Hungary, Italy, Austria Not a single EU member state broke ranks on sanctions 10) The Kremlin s active measures campaign in the US goes into overdrive as Russia seeks to shape the 2020 presidential field Dark money becomes the main tool of Kremlin influence as Russia concludes that financing organic disinformation is more effective than offshore ops There is no evidence to support this theory In fact, experts in Moscow suggest the Kremlin will do everything possible to avoid anything which may be perceived as interference in the 2020 US election This is because a) Russian leaders don t want to make life even more difficult for President Trump, and b) hope to avoid a repeat of the hysteria of the past few years If Carpenter had made errors in a few of his forecasts, you could cut him a bit of slack But the fact he was so spectacularly inaccurate, yet doesn t seem remotely embarrassed about it, is incredibly depressing It also serves to prove a point I have made for years now: it seems nobody in America, or the UK, has ever suffered career damage as a result of being wrong about Russia Instead, they appear to fail up ù The pundits and pontificators know this And it encourages them to become more shrill in their disinformation and agitprop Update: Mr Carpenter replies that he managed the Open Skies program at the Pentagon & gets it far better than I do He also says I am a dumbass ps reason for blank tweet is I reposted, owing to a typo in original https://t co/EYTmFM0FWa Back in August, I called out Carpenter on Twitter after he pushed falsehoods about the Open Skies ù observation program From which the US is reportedly considering withdrawing The former government official launched an extraordinary personal attack, labeling me a dumbass, ù before resorting to the last refuge of the scoundrel by blocking my account I m too polite to respond in kind, but it s quite something to have your intelligence questioned by someone who is clearly out to lunch when it comes to his own purported area of expertise Think your friends would be interested?

US media (and corespondents in Moscow) presume his innocence, but presume guilt of Russians arrested under similar suspicions in US Right on cue, some in the media rushed to capitalize on McFaul s dodgy guidance, with one article warning that Americans might not be safe ùin Russia despite the State Department only ùissuing a Level 2 travel advisory for the country A Level 2 warning, by the way, already advises tourists to exercise increased caution ù There luckily was some more pushback against McFaul, with Syracuse University professor Brian Taylor putting things into perspective, noting that more than 150,000 Americans travel to Russia every year and they aren t all getting locked up for spying Over 150K Americans go to üá∑üá∫every year The risk of dying in a car crash, in üá∫üá∏or while in üá∑üá∫as a tourist, are much higher than the risk of being arrested as a spy I know that s no comfort to Whelan, but let s keep things in perspective Traveling to üá∑üá∫is still very safe pic twitter com/1OAL776MtY Unfortunately, however, this concept that Russia is unsafe for tourists isn t exactly new and was doing the rounds in Western media well before McFaul weighed in with his two cents In 2015, Russia was listed as the 11th most dangerous country in the world above places like Yemen and Libya in a bizarre Western ranking, which Ideconstructedat the time I have personally traveled to about 13 different Russian cities from St Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok in the Far East î and some very remote places in between î so I have a fairly solid grasp of how tourists (hailing from anywhere) fare in the country In fact, it s probably a better grasp than McFaul has, since his experience as a US government official is hardly indicative of how most visitors experience the country His view might also be colored by the fact that he was placed on a retaliatory sanctions list and banned from entering the country in 2016 Of course, there are always going to be moments when you feel apprehensive in a foreign country Immediately after the Paris attacks in 2015, I remember feeling a general sense of apprehension in big public spaces like metro stations and shopping centers in Moscow, but this is nothing unique to Russia I can honestly say there was never a time when I felt that I was in a scary or especially dangerous place In fact, I felt safer walking on Moscow streets after dark than I did in Washington D C or Budapest î two other places I lived for a while Now, I m not an American, so I can t say with absolute certainty that I would not have been hauled off to some secret Siberian gulag for unsuspecting American tourists if I was, but I m going to go out on a limb here and say I would have been fine î just like all the Americans I regularly saw enjoying themselves without being handcuffed and accused of espionage Just imagine it If Russia, for example, was experiencing mass shootings on the scale that the US does, the State Department would likely issue a stark travel warning about the level of societal violence in big, bad, scary Russia If we re being totally honest, you d probably be more justified in advising black people not to travel to the US due to a clear police bias against African Americans in the country than you would be telling Americans to skip Russia because one guy was arrested for alleged spying About two years ago, in a restaurant in St Petersburg (which ranks as the world sbest cultural destination, by the way), a Russian waitresstold methat she would love to travel to the US, but she hadn t bothered even applying for a visa because she was afraid Americans would automatically be suspicious ùof her as a Russian If the constant stream of negativity toward Russia (and Russians in general) in American mainstream media is anything to go by, she is also more justified in that assumption than McFaul is in advising Americans that Russia is not safe Two weeks ago, a British woman posted a Twitter thread about her Christmas trip across Russia on the Trans Mongolian railway from Moscow to Beijing It involved stunning scenery, friendly locals, good food, extremely cold weather î and believe it or not, a wonderful time was had and nobody seems to have gotten arrested Last night we caught the Trans Mongolian railway from Moscow to Beijingpic twitter com/jIZ1dmXRBC The thread is a must read for anyone wanting to know what travel in Russia is really like, minus the sensationalized Western media portrayals It s a real shame that some Americans who otherwise might have made the journey, will miss out thanks to such unwarranted fear Here s the beautiful cups we got to make our tea and chocolate on the train ù§Ô∏èpic twitter com/dUu9Cz0ehq ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/448028-mcfaul-russia-tourists-safe/
"5 Dec, 2018",New Cold War is more dangerous than the one the world survived ‚Äì Stephen Cohen," War With Russia? , like the biography of a living person, is a book without an end The title is a warning akin to what the late Gore Vidal termed a journalistic alert system ù not a prediction Hence the question mark I cannot foresee the future The book s overarching theme is informed by past and current facts, not by any political agenda, ideological commitment, or magical prescience The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk Hegel To restate that theme: The new US Russian Cold War is more dangerous than was its 40 year predecessor that the world survived The chances are even greater that this one could result, inadvertently or intentionally, in actual war between the two nuclear superpowers Herein lies another ominous indication During the preceding Cold War, the possibility of nuclear catastrophe was in the forefront of American mainstream political and media discussion, and of policy making During the new one, it rarely seems to be even a concern In the latter months of 2018, the facts and the mounting crises they document grow worse, especially in the US political media establishment, where, as I have argued, the new Cold War originated and has been repeatedly escalated Consider a few examples, some of them not unlike political and media developments during the run up to the US war in Iraq or, historians have told us, how the great powers sleepwalked ù into World War I: Russiagate s core allegations îUS Russian collusion, treason îall remain unproven Yet they have become a central part of the new Cold War If nothing else, they severely constrain President Donald Trump s capacity to conduct crisis negotiations with Moscow while they further vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin for having, it is widely asserted, personally ordered an attack on America ù during the 2016 presidential campaign Some Hollywood liberals had earlier omitted the question mark, declaring, We are at war ù In October 2018, the would be titular head of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, added her voice to this reckless allegation,flatly statingthat the United States was attacked by a foreign power ù and equating it with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks ù Clinton may have been prompted by another outburst of malpractice byThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post On September 20 and 23, respectively, those exceptionally influential papers devoted thousands of words, illustrated with sinister prosecutorial graphics, to special retellings of the Russiagate narrative they had assiduously promoted for nearly two years, along with the narrative s serial fallacies, selective and questionable history, and factual errors Again, for example, the now infamous Paul Manafort, who was Trump s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, was said to have been pro Kremlin ù during his time as a lobbyist for Ukraine under then President Viktor Yanukovych, when in fact he was pro European Union Again, Trump s disgraced national security adviser, Gen Michael Flynn, was accused of troubling ùcontacts when he did nothing wrong or unprecedented in having conversations with a Kremlin representative on behalf of President elect Trump Again, the two papers criminalized the idea, as the Times put it, that the UnitedStates and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest, ù once the premise of d√©tente And again, the Times, while assuring readers that its Special Report ù is what we now know with certainty, ù buried a related acknowledgment deep in its some 10,000 words: No public evidence has emerged showing that [Trump s] campaign conspired with Russia ù (The white collar criminal indictments and guilty pleas cited were so unrelated that they added up to Russiagate without Russia ) Astonishingly, neither paper gave any credence to anemphatic statementby the Post s own Bob Woodward înormally considered the most authoritative chronicler of Washington s political secrets îthat, after two years of research, he had found no evidence of collusion betweenTrump and Russia Nor were the Times, the Post, and other print media alone in these practices, which continued to slur dissenting opinions CNN s leading purveyor of Russiagate allegationstweetedthat an American third party presidential candidate had been repeating Russian talking points on its interference in the 2016 election and on US foreign policy ù Another prominent CNN figure was, so to speak, more geopolitical,warning, Only a fool takes Vladimir Putin at his word in Syria, ù thereby ruling out US Russian cooperation in that war torn country Much the same continued almost nightly on MSNBC For most mainstream media outlets, Russiagate had become, it seemed, a kind of cult journalism that no counterevidence or analysis could dent and thus itself increasingly a major contributing factor to the new Cold War Still more, what began two years earlier as complaints about Russian meddling ù in the US presidential election became by October 2018, forThe New Yorkerand other publications, an accusation that the Kremlin had actually put Donald Trump in the White House For this seditious charge, there was also no convincing evidence înor any precedent in American history At a higher level, by fall 2018, current and former US officials were making nearly unprecedented threats against Moscow The ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison,threatenedto take out ù any Russian missiles she thought violated a 1987 treaty, a step that would certainly risk nuclear war The secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke,threateneda naval blockade ù of Russia In yet another Russophobic outburst, the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley,declaredthat lying, cheating and rogue behavior ù are a norm of Russianculture ù These may have been outlandish statements by untutored political appointees, but they again inescapably raised the question: Who was making Russia policy in Washington † President Trump, with his avowed policy of cooperation, ù or someone else? But how to explain, other than as unbridled extremism, thecommentsby Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, himself a longtime professor of Russian politics and favored mainstream commentator? According to McFaul, Russia had become a rogue state, ù its policies criminal actions ù and the world s greatest threat ù It had to be countered by preemptive sanctions that would go into effect automatically ù î every day, ù if deemed necessary Considering the possibility of crushing ù sanctions proposedrecentlyby a bipartisan group of US senators, this would be nothing less than a declaration of permanent war against Russia: economic war, but war nonetheless Meanwhile, other new Cold War fronts were becoming more fraught with hot war, none more so than Syria On September 17, Syrian missiles accidentally shot down an allied Russian surveillance aircraft, killing all 15 crew members The cause was combat subterfuge by Israeli warplanes in the area The reaction in Moscow was indicative and potentially ominous At first, Putin, who had developed good relations with Israel s political leadership, said the incident was an accident caused by the fog of war His own Defense Ministry, however, loudly protested that Israel was responsible Putin quickly retreated to a more hard line position, and in the end vowed to send to Syria Russia s highly effective S 300 surface to air defense system, a prize long sought by both Syria and Iran Clearly, Putin was not the ever aggressive Kremlin autocrat ù unrelentingly portrayed by US mainstream media A moderate in the Russian context, he again made a major decision by balancing conflicting groups and interests In this instance, he accommodated long standing hard liners in his own security establishment The result is yet another Cold War trip wire With the S 300s installed in Syria, Putin could in effect impose a no fly zone ù over large areas of the country, which has been ravaged by war due, in no small part, to the presence of several foreign powers (Russia and Iran are there legally; the United States and Israel are not ) If so, this means a new red line ù that Washington and its ally Israel will have to decide whether or not to cross Considering the mania in Washington and in the mainstream media, it is hard to be confident that restraint will prevail In keeping with his Russia policy, President Trump may reasonably be inclined to join Moscow s peace process, though it is unlikely the mostly Democrat inspired Russiagate party would permit him to do so Now another Cold War front has also become morefraught, the US Russian proxy war in Ukraine having acquired a new dimension In addition to the civil war in Donbass, Moscow and Kiev have been challenging each other s ships in the Sea of Azov, near the newly built bridge connecting Russia with Crimea On November 25, this erupted into a small but potentially explosive military conflict at sea Trump is being pressured to help Kiev escalate the maritime war yet another potential trip wire Here, too, the president should instead put his administration s weight behind the long stalled Minsk peace accords But that approach also seems to be ruled out by Russiagate, which by October 6 included yet another Times columnist, Frank Bruni,brandingall such initiatives by Trump as pimping for Putin ù After five years of extremism, as demonstrated by these recent examples of risking war with Russia, there remained, for the first time in decades of Cold War history, no countervailing forces in Washington † no pro d√©tente wing of the Democratic or Republican Party, no influential anti Cold War opposition anywhere, no real public debate There was only Trump, with all the loathing he inspired, and even he had not reminded the nation or his own party that the presidents who initiated major episodes of d√©tente in the 20th century were also Republicans † Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan This too seemed to be an inadmissible alternative fact ù And so the eternal question, not only for Russians: What is to be done? There is a ray of light, though scarcely more In August 2018,Gallupasked Americans what kind of policy toward Russia they favored Even amid the torrent of vilifying Russiagate allegations and Russophobia, 58 percent wanted to improve relations with Russia, ù as opposed to 36 percent who preferred strong diplomatic and economic steps against Russia ù This reminds us that the new Cold War, from NATO s eastward expansion and the 2014 Ukrainian crisis to Russiagate, has been an elite project Why US elites, after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, ultimately chose Cold War rather than partnership with Russia is a question beyond my purpose here As for the special role of US intelligence elites † what I have termed Intelgate ù efforts are still underway to disclose it fully, and are still being thwarted A full explanation of the post Soviet Cold War choice would include the US political media establishment s needs † ideological, foreign policy, and budgetary, among others † for an enemy ù Or, with the Cold War having prevailed for more than half of US Russian relations during the century since 1917, maybe it was habitual Substantial meddling ù in the 2016 US election by Ukraine and Israel, to illustrate the point, did not become a political scandal In any event, once this approach to post Soviet Russia began, promoting it was not hard The legendary humorist Will Rogers quipped in the 1930s, Russia is a country that no matter what you say about it, it s true ù Back then, before the 40 year Cold War and nuclear weapons, the quip was funny, but no longer Whatever the full explanation, many of the consequences I have analyzed in War With Russia? continue to unfold, not a few unintended and unfavorable to America s real national interests Russia s turn away from the West, its pivot to China, ù is now widely acknowledged and embraced by leading Moscow policy thinkers Even European allies occasionally stand with Moscow against Washington The US backed Kiev government still covers up who was really behind the 2014 Maidan snipers massacre ù that brought it to power Mindless US sanctions have helped Putin to repatriate oligarchic assets abroad, at least $90 billion already in 2018 The mainstream media persist in distorting Putin s foreign policies into something that even the Soviet Unionnever dared to try ù And when an anonymous White House insiderexposedin theTimesthe amorality ù of President Trump, the only actual policy he or she singled out was on Russia I have focused enough on the demonizing of Putin † the Post even managed to characterize popular support for his substantial contribution to improving life in Moscow as a deal with the devil ù † but it is important to note that this derangement is far from worldwide Even aPostcorrespondentconcededthat the Putin brand has captivated anti establishment and anti American politicians all over the world ù A British journalistconfirmedthat, as a result, many countries in the world now look for a reinsurance policy with Russia ùAnd an American journalist living in Moscowreportedthat the ceaseless demonization of Putin personally has in fact sanctified him, turned him into the Patron Saint of Russia ù Again, in light of all this, what can be done? Sentimentally, and with some historical precedents, we of democratic beliefs traditionally look to the people, ù to voters, to bring about change But foreign policy has long been the special prerogative of elites In order to change Cold War policy fundamentally, leaders are needed When the times beckon, they may emerge out of established, even deeply conservative, elites, as did unexpectedly the now pro d√©tente Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid 1980s But given the looming danger of war with Russia, is there time? Is any leader visible on the American political landscape who will say to his or her elites and party, as Gorbachev did, If not now, when? If not us, who? ù We also know that such leaders, though embedded in and insulated by their elites, hear and read other, nonconformist voices, other thinking The once venerated American journalist Walter Lippmann observed, Where all think alike, no one thinks very much ù This book is my modest attempt to inspire more thinking Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor of †The Nation This article was originally published †byThe Nationand is adapted from the concluding section of Stephen F Cohen sWar With Russia?

Why is this still consistently happening? Google is allowing its algorithm to be manipulated We need algorithmic transparency Now pic twitter com/YmblijUHSd How does Google even allow this to happen, Polyakova wonders on Twitter? There can be only one answer: it s the wily Russian propagandists, manipulating search algorithms to worm their way into the enemy s search returns and eat away at their Putin hating resolve (By the way, the Ukrainian UNIAN is also there, daring to get ahead of US media on a Ukrainian story!) Similarly worried is Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, self proclaimed victimized personal foe of Putin, and peddler of his own book on Russia s evil ways It seems all the stories we ve run on McFaul snumerous gaffesare finally paying off! For every individual on Google, this search yields different results (I don t get UNIAN in my search) But even in cognito ù search produces Sputnik, RT, Sputnik! Not good https:// t co /KcnFwzDDtB Even YouTube has betrayed the former envoy, allowing videos by RT (one of the most viewed news channels) to creep up and appear frequently in his search results not at the top spot, though (no New Year bonus for you, Ivan!)

Send me evidence In court filings, the FBIsaidthat Azov Battalion is a paramilitary unit of the Ukrainian National Guard which is known for its association with neo Nazi ideology and use of Nazi symbolism, and which is believed to have participated in training and radicalizing United States based white supremacy organizations If a group is part of the regular law enforcement force and a top officialpraisesits members as national heroes, it seems like convincing evidence of government support In 2014, President Petro Poroshenko evenpresentedAzov s leader, Andriy Biletsky, with the Order For Courage At the time, Biletsky was also the head of the Social National Assembly, an organization committed to punishing severely sexual perversions and any interracial contacts that lead to the extinction of the white man The BBCcalledthe notion a typical neo Nazi narrative, in a July report And the list goes on and on McFaul s argument that a government headed by a Jewish person cannot possibly support neo Nazis doesn t seem to hold water In May 2017, Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymir Groysman personally travelled to Israel to secure the purchase of weapons for Azov Battalion, which has since published videos of its members training with Israeli assault rifles As Haaretzreportedat the time: Israel is exporting weapons to Ukraine, knowing that they reach right wing militias, some members of which are avowed neo Nazis who enjoy the support of the authorities It seems like somebody is living in denial",https://www.rt.com/news/445039-mcfaul-ukraine-nazis-denial/

Cohen,"For nearly 100 years, Russia has been under US sanctions, often to the detriment of American national security Cohen begins by putting the current bipartisan Senate campaign to impose new, crushing sanctions on Russia in historical context Broadly understood, sanctions have been part of US policy toward Russia for much of the past 100 years During the Russian civil war of 1918 20, President Woodrow Wilson sent American troops to fight against the emerging Soviet government Though the Reds ù were clearly the established government of Soviet Russia by 1921, Washington continued to deny the USSR diplomatic recognition until President Franklin D Roosevelt established formal relations in 1933 During much of the 40 year Cold War, the United States imposed various sanctions on its superpower rival, mainly related to technological and military exports, along with periodic expulsions of diplomats and spies on both sides Congress major political contribution was the 1975 Jackson Vanik Amendment, which denied Moscow privileged trading status with the United States, primarily because of Kremlin restrictions on Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union Indicative of how mindlessly habitual US sanctions had become, Jackson Vanik was nullified only in late 2012, long after the end of the Soviet Union and after any restrictions on Jews leaving (or returning to) Russia Even more indicative, it was immediately replaced, in December 2012, by the Magnitsky Act, which purported to sanction individual Russian officials and oligarchs for human rights abuses The Magnitsky Act remains law, supplemented by additional sanctions leveled against Russia as a result of the 2014 Ukrainian crisis and particularly Moscow s annexation of Crimea Looking back over this long history, there is no evidence that any US sanctions ever significantly altered Moscow s behavior in ways that were intended Or that they adversely affected Russia s ruling political or financial elites Any pain inflicted fell on ordinary citizens, who nonetheless rallied patriotically around the Kremlin leadership, most recently around Russian President Vladimir Putin Historically, such sanctions were not problem solving measures advancing American national security but more akin to temper tantrums or road rage, making things even worse, than to real policymaking Why, then, Washington s new bout of sanction mania against Moscow, especially considering the harsh official Russian reaction expressed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who called the Senate s proposed measures a declaration of economic war and promised that the Kremlin would retaliate? One explanation is an underlying, astonishing assumption †recentlystated by Michael McFaul, the media ubiquitous former US ambassador to Moscow and a longtime Russia scholar: To advance almost all of our core national security and economic interests, the US does not need Russia Such a statement by a former or current policymaker and intellectual is perhaps unprecedented in modern times and manifestly wrong US core interests need Russia s cooperation in many vital ways They include avoiding nuclear war; preventing a new and more dangerous arms race; guarding against the proliferation of weapons and materials of mass destruction; coping with international terrorists (who are in pursuit of such materials); achieving lasting peace in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East; fostering prosperity and stability in Europe, of which Russia is a part; promoting better relations with the Islamic world, of which Russia is also a part; and avoiding a generation long confrontation with a formidable new alliance that already includes Russia, China, Iran, and other non NATO countries If McFaul s assumption is widespread in Washington, as it seems to be, we are living in truly unwise and perilous times A second assumption is no less myopic and dangerous: that the Kremlin is weak and lacks countermeasures to adopt against the new sanctions being advocated in Washington Consider, however, the following real possibilities Moscow could sell off its billions of dollars of US Treasury securities and begin trading with friendly nations in non dollar currencies, both of which it has already begun to do It could restrict, otherwise undermine, or even shut down many large US corporations long doing profitable business in Russia, among them Citibank, Cisco Systems, Apple, Microsoft, PepsiCo, McDonald s, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co , and even Boeing It could end titanium exports to the United States, which are vital to American civilian and military aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing And terminate the sale of rocket engines essential for NASA and US satellite operations The world s largest territorial country, Russia could charge US airlines higher tariffs for their regular use of its air space or ban them altogether, making them uncompetitive against other national carriers Politically, the Kremlin could end its own sanctions on Iran and North Korea, alleviating Washington s pressure on those governments And it could end the Russian supply transit to US troops fighting in Afghanistan used since the early 1990s None of this seems to have been considered by Washington s sanction zealots Nor have four other circumstances Sanctions against Russia s oligarchs actually help Putin, whom the US political media establishment so despises and constantly indicts For years, he has been trying to persuade many of the richest oligarchs to repatriate their offshore wealth to Russia Few did so Now, fearful of having their assets abroad frozen or seized by US measures, more and more are complying Second, new sanctions limiting Moscow s ability to borrow and finance investment at home will retard the country s still meager growth rate But the Kremlin coped after the 2014 sanctions and will do so again by turning away even more from the West and toward China and other non Western partners, and by developing its own capacity to produce sanctioned imports (Russian agricultural production, for example, has surged in recent years, now becoming a major export industry ) Third, already unhappy with existing economic sanctions against Russia, European multinational corporations † and thus Europe itself † may tilt even farther away from their capricious transatlantic partner in Washington, who is diminishing their vast market in the East And fourth, waging economic war is one impulsive step from breaking off all diplomatic relations with Russia, this too actually being discussed by Washington zealots Such a rupture would turn the clock back many decades, but in an era when there is no globalization, or international security, without Russia Finally, what reason do Washington extreme Cold Warriors themselves give for imposing new sanctions on Russia? Most of them are in the US Senate, historically a body with at least several independent minded distinguished statesmen, but no longer, with the apparently solitary exception of Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has demonstrated considerable wisdom in regard to US Russian relations Their professed reasons are various and nonsensical Some say Russia must be sanctioned for Ukraine, but those events happened four years ago and have already been punished Others say for Russia s aggression in Syria, but it was Putin s military intervention that destroyed the Islamic State s terrorist occupation of much of the country and ended its threat to take Damascus, to the benefit of America and its allies, including Europe and Israel Still others insist the Kremlin must be sanctioned for its nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK several months ago But the British government s case against the Kremlin has virtually fallen apart, as any attentive reader of articles inDavid Johnson s Russia Listwill understand Ultimately, though, the new bout of sanction mania is in response to Russia s alleged attack on American democracy during the 2016 presidential election In reality, there was no attack † no Pearl Harbor, no 9/11, no Russian parachuters descending on Washington † only the kind of meddling and interference in the other s domestic politics that both countries have practiced, almost ritualistically, for nearly a hundred years Indeed, whatever meddling Russian actors did in 2016 may well have been jaywalking compared to the Clinton administration s massive, highly intrusive political and financial intervention on behalf of the failing Russian President Boris Yeltsin s reelection campaign in 1996 We are left, then, with the real reason behind the new anti Russian sanctions effort: to thwart and even punish President Donald Trump for his policy of cooperation with Russia And Putin too for having met and cooperated with Trump at their Helsinki summit in July This bizarre, also unprecedented, reality is more than a whisper According to aNew York Times † news analysis, as well as other published reports, a bipartisan group of senators, dismayed that Mr Trump had not publicly confronted Mr Putin over Russia s election meddling, released draft legislation of new sanctions against Moscow Passage of such a bill would impose some of the most damaging sanctions yet Leave aside for now that it is not Russian meddling that is delegitimizing our elections but instead these fact free allegations themselves that are doing so (How many losing candidates in 2018 will claim their victory was snatched away by Putin?) Consider instead that for doing what every American president since Eisenhower has done meet with the sitting Kremlin leader in order to avoid stumbling into a war between the nuclear superpowers in effect both Trump and Putin are being condemned by the Washington establishment, including by members of Trump s own intelligence agencies If so, who will avert the prospect of war with Russia, a new Cuban missile like crisis, conceivably in the Baltic region, Ukraine, or Syria? Certainly not any leading representative of the Democratic Party Certainly not the current Russophobic bipartisan Senate Certainly not the most influential media outlets, which amplify the warmongering folly almost daily In this most existential regard, there is for now only, like it or not, President Donald Trump Stephen F Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US Russian Cold War Previous installments, now in their fifth year, are atTheNation com Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor of †The Nation This article was originallypublishedby The Nation",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/436148-cohen-sanctions-russia-us/

"7 Aug, 2018","Michael McFaul, what have YOU done to help improve US-Russia relations?","The former US ambassador to Russia has proven to be quite adept at chastising Russia at every turn, even in retirement But what exactly has McFaul done to create an atmosphere of lasting peace between Moscow and Washington? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge It was the summer of 2013 when I had my first and only encounter with Michael McFaul, then US Ambassador to Russia It was a Saturday afternoon, and a black sedan pulled into the parking lot of the prestigious Anglo American School, a private learning facility located in the outskirts of Moscow where foreign diplomats and corporate executives enroll their kids A burly driver opened the door and into the scorching sun appeared, in all his excellency, Michael McFaul After exchanging brief pleasantries, the ambassador strolled to the bleachers on the opposite side of the field to await the beginning of a children s baseball game; a bit of an anticlimactic turn compared to the grand entry I remember thinking to myself at the time, as he took a seat by himself across the pitch, There goes the loneliest man in the world Sooner than I would have imagined, my impression of the ambassador and his unenviable situation in Russia was confirmed Several months later, McFaul abruptly resigned from his government post after just two years on the job, returning to the dusty halls of academia from where he had first emerged to work in the Obama administration Despite his retirement, and being banned from Russia, McFaul continues to elicit inflammatory opinions on Putin s Russia on a regular basis Few of these verbal fusillades prove helpful at injecting some semblance of sanity back into the US Russia relationship This week, for example, McFaul went head to head against Steven Seagal, the Hollywood actor and martial arts expert who was just appointed as Russia s special representative on humanitarian relations with the US Seagal s workincludes, among other duties, promoting bilateral ties in a wide range of fields including culture, art, science, education, sports, public and youth exchanges ù Considering the basement level status of the US Russia relationship, it would seem that any attempt to forge bonds between the two nuclear powers deserves some applause, even if it s just a polite golf clap That logic doesn t apply re Michael McFaul Following the appointment, McFaul promptly fired up his Twitter account to pedantically slam Seagal for using British spelling as opposed to American while announcing his new post Our esteemed academic, however, broke the first rule of social media sparring by failing to ensure that his own tweet was grammatically sound are working to improve with the US, why do you use the British spelling of honor ?! First rule of diplomacy respect the culture and traditions of your your host country, aka as the place where you were born https:// t co /59lKEj69wm In any event, McFaul went on topredictthat Seagal would ultimately fail to achieve any success in improving Russian American relations, ù not only because the Hollywood actor has almost no influence ù in the United States, but because wait for it he has no experience in diplomacy ù As the attentive reader will recall, the lack of diplomatic credentials was precisely the main argument against McFaul s two year stint as US ambassador Not only was the Stanford professor the first non career diplomat toserveas US ambassador to Russia, he arrived in Moscow with a rather odd CV, which included a doctorate dissertationdevotedto the theory of revolution in an international context ù To complicate his stay in Russia even more, one of McFaul s very first orders of business in Moscow was to meet with members of the Russian opposition and at the very same time street protests and color revolutions were becoming all the rage How s that for diplomacy? The story gets better Judging by a recent request put forward by Russia s general prosecutor s office, in which it specifically named Michael McFaul as a person of interest in thecriminal caseagainst Bill Browder, the British financier who is wanted in Russia for illegally moving $1 5 billion out of the country, it would suggest that the ambassador was not limited to just meeting with political agitators McFaul, however, has denied any wrongdoing Hey WH press Corps, can you confirm tomorrow with@PressSecthat Putin discussed me personally in his one on one with Trump? Did he suggest that I was part of some alleged money laundering scheme? And did Trump push back on this completely invented , whacko idea? This was just the later innings, as it were, of what appears to have been a doubleheader the professor was playing Before being nominated to the position of US ambassador, Michael McFaul was a senior adviser of the Obama administration, where he went on to become the architect of the much maligned US Russia Reset You know a program isdoomedfrom the start when not even the US State Department is able to correctly translate the idea into Russian For a man who is so concerned with proper spelling, you d think he would have gotten that one right READ MORE:Nervous, are we? Ex ambassador McFaul on defensive over Russia s wish to question him Yet it was much more than just poor translating skills that ensured the demise of the Reset; the failure was a result of Washington s absolute refusal to cooperate with Russia on the US missile defense shield in Eastern Europe Any serious discussion on the US Russia bilateral relationship is incomplete without mentioning this part of the story Initiallypledgingto shelve ù the brainchild weapon system of the Bush administration (just months after McFaul s Reset is announced in March 2009), the Obama administration shifted gears, telling the world it would opt for a scaled down version of the system instead, all the while holding out the carrot of cooperation to Moscow However, unless the Obama administration committed itself to a real partnership with Russia, McFaul s Reset would have to be interpreted for what it arguably was: an elaborate smokescreen to soften up Moscow into believing the White House had honorable intentions As events strongly indicate, it did not Fortunately for Russia, it did not fall for the ruse It got to work developing ways to balance the military scales that were beginning to dangerously tip due to a US made weapon system on its very doorstep That much was underscored by Vladimir Putin s recent state of the nation address in which herevealedthe introduction of advanced weapon systems that make obsolete ù any missile defense shield in the world Had the Obama administration not taken a cynical and deceptive approach to its diplomatic relations with Russia, as demonstrated by McFaul s fake Reset, the world would not be perched on the precipice of disaster as it is today These days, the former US ambassador continues to muddy the bilateral waters, dispatching tirades against Russia via Twitter to his 339,000 followers, many of whom share the same jaded views, which has a tendency to occur whenever ideas are cultivated in an echo chamber Igor is wrong The United States does not NEED Russia for anything I hope our president understands that https:// t co /zJpcyTnRWh It may go down as the tragedy of our days that the Obama administration, believing Russia was down for the proverbial count, dispatched to Moscow a non diplomat at the precise moment when diplomacy between the two nuclear powers was more important than ever In hindsight, it was a dangerous move on the global chessboard that will have ramifications on international politics for many decades to come Nevertheless, Russia not only survived the challenge, but it looks quite capable of defending its long term interests It is a regrettable conclusion, but I would argue that Michael McFaul and his colleagues in the Obama administration view Russia s stunning revival, as witnessed on both the military and economic fronts, as a genuine failure of diplomacy on their part Faced with that sort of cynical, duplicitous approach to Russia, the bilateral relationship needs many more sincere ambassadors of peace, like Steven Seagal, working tirelessly on behalf of friendship between the two countries",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/435369-mcfaul-michael-russia-relations/

He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Considering the unmistakable Liberal bent of the US mainstream media complex, which churns out anti Trump, anti Russia stories with more predictable homogeneity than a Pringles potato chip factory, the chances of the Putin Trump summit winning any positive reviews back home was about slim to none And, as if to worsen those dismal odds even more, US Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, with timing so uncanny it could only have been premeditated,announcedindictments against 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their alleged involvement in hacking the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) That bombshell, coming just days before the opening of the summit, appears to have knocked President Donald Trump off his horse in Helsinki, forcing him into a defensive posture The reason is obvious: any talk of Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election works to delegitimize his presidency In other words, according to the Russiagaters, it was not due to the democratic will of the American people that Trump secured a historic victory, but rather some Russian Facebook and Twitter ads Putin, however, whose political fortunes are not swinging in the breeze of an intensely partisan witch hunt on the domestic front, offered to meet US officials halfway ùin an effort to close the Russiagate case once and for all Pointing to the 1999agreementbetween the US and Russia, entitled, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Putin reminded US officials that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is entitled to send a formal request to have those Russian citizens facing charges in the United States undergo questioning by the Russian authorities He even offered to allow American officials to be present in Russia during the interrogation ùprocess We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr Mueller, we can lead them into the country and they will be present at this questioning, ùthe Russian leader said The second part of Putin s offer came with a quid pro quo Putin proposed that US authorities reciprocate and interrogate particular American citizens whom the Kremlin suspects of having engaged in illegal activities in Russia And, as with the indicted Russians, the questioning of the Americans would take place in the presence of Russian officials Trump hailed Putin s idea as an incredible offer, ùwhile at least one of his perennial critics back homeslammedthe President s comments as treasonous Putin went on to specifically mention a criminal case involving Bill Browder, a British investor who wassentencedin absentia to nine years in prison on fraud and tax evasion charges by a Russian court in 2017 Putin confirmed Browder earned over $1 5 billion in Russia ù tax free They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor the United States, and yet the money escaped the country, ùthe Russian leader noted They were transferred to the United States ù Putin then made an explosive revelation, alleging that, of the money funneled out of Russia, a huge sum was donated by Browder s associates as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton ùWhile admitting that the contribution in the exorbitant US political system might have been legal, ùthe Russian leader emphasized that the way the money was earned was illegal ù Browder, who is currently living in England, branded the accusations ludicrous ù In reaction to Putin s proposal, the howls of protest came fast and furious One of the most vocal opponents was Michael McFaul, who served as US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 under the Obama administration McFaul, the first non career diplomat to serve in such a capacity, is not entirely detached from the US born British businessman In May 2018, for example, when Browder was arrested in Madrid on a Russian arrest warrant, he called for Russia to be expelled from Interpol ù Russian needs to be excluded from Interpol https:// t co /xKFZdF6HzS The career academic, clearlyunnervedby the prospect of being interrogated in the presence of Russian officials, requested information from the White House press pool in one of many Twitter posts devoted to the subject Hey WH press Corps, can you confirm tomorrow with@PressSecthat Putin discussed me personally in his one on one with Trump? Did he suggest that I was part of some alleged money laundering scheme? And did Trump push back on this completely invented , whacko idea? But is it really so whacko ùabout having some high ranking government officials, even former diplomats who worked under the aegis of immunity, answer questions about an ongoing investigation? Indeed, Mueller should view Putin s offer as a golden opportunity to sit down with the indicted Russians and present the case against them, complete with all of the necessary evidence At the same time, it would allow the accused Russians to have an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges, since the possibility of doing so in the United States, given the current political climate, would be impossible All things considered, Putin s proposal provided all the necessary elements for a fair and unbiased case against the accused However, the fact that Trump won t be able to implement such a plan due to the extreme acrimony back home much of it pure hyperbole seems to indicate that Putin called Mueller s bluff After all, if there was any ironclad proof of Russian involvement in the hacking of the DNC servers, there would be no hesitation on the part of US officials to travel to Russia and present it Interesting how the spirit of transparency and openness seems attractive only when it works on behalf of a particular political agenda In any case, Putin may get a second chance to float his idea of a joint investigation with US leaders soon enough Even before Washington has had a chance to digest the Helsinki summit, Trump has alreadyinvitedPutin to the White House for more discussions in the fall Load up on the popcorn, the show has only just begun @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/433793-putin-helsinki-interrogations-russiagate/

"19 Jul, 2018",US diplomats act like imperial governors riding roughshod over sovereignty of national governments,"On the world s Grand Chessboard, the US is fighting for control and influence And there are countries where its ambassadors are perceived more as imperial governors than simple channels of communication At the height of the Maidan protests in Kiev in early 2014, a conversation was leaked between the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, and the then Assistant Secretary of State in the Obama administration, Victoria Nuland The conversation gained notoriety because Nuland said to Pyatt, F**k the EU and the recording was almost instantly available onYoutube More shocking than Nuland s bad language, however, was what the conversation was about The US government officials were discussing how to put their men into power in Ukraine which of the three then opposition factions would dominate, who would take the lead (Arseniy Yatsenyuk) and who would be excluded (Vladimir Klitschko) † At the time of this conversation, early February 2014, their enemy Viktor Yanukovych was still president The leaked recording proved that the US and its Kiev embassy were actively involved in a regime change operation The composition of the post Maidan government corresponded exactly with US plans What few people knew at the time was that such levels of control over the composition of foreign governments had become standard practice for US embassies all over the world As I could see on my very numerous travels around the Balkans in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the US ambassador was treated by the political class and the media in those countries not as the officially accredited representative of a foreign government but instead as an imperial governor whose pronunciamentos were more important than those of the national government This has been going on for decades, although the levels of control exercised by the United States increased as it rushed to fill the political vacuum created by the collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe after 1989 In earlier times, such control, especially regime change operations, had to be conducted either covertly, as with the overthrow of Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, in 1953, or by financing and arming an anti government militia, such as in Nicaragua and elsewhere in central and South America, or by encouraging the army itself, most famously in Chile in 1973 There is a huge body of literature on this vast subject (for the coup against Mosaddegh, see especially All the Shah s Men by Stephen Kinzer, 2003) and there is no possibility of denying that such operations took place Indeed, former CIA director, James Woolsey, recentlyadmittedthat they continue to this day Many of the ambassadors who engineered or attempted regime change operations in Eastern Europe and the former USSR had cut their teeth in Latin America in 1980s and 1990s One of them, Michael Kozak, former US ambassador to Belarus, even boasted in a letter to The Guardian in 2001 that he was doing the same thing in Minsk as he had done in Managua He wrote: As regards parallels between Nicaragua in 1989 90 and Belarus today, I plead guilty Our objective and to some degree methodology are the same Kozak did not mention that he also played a key role in the overthrow of General Noriega in Panama in 1989 but he is far from alone The experience accumulated by the Americans during the Cold War, including in major European countries like Italy where US interference was key to preventing Communist victories in elections, spawned a whole generation of Kermit Roosevelts (the architect of the coup against Mosaddegh) who have made their careers over decades in the State Department Some names, such as that of Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia who made no secret of his opposition to the president of the state to which he was accredited, will be familiar to RT readers Two years after the violent overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, which he helped coordinate, Geoffrey Pyatt was appointed US ambassador to Greece He remains in that post to this day which is why some are asking whether his hand might be behind last week s expulsion of Russian diplomats from Athens Greece and Russia have customarily had good relations but they differ on the Macedonian issue Now, the Greek government headed by the pseudo Euroskeptic Alexis Tsipras, claims that four Russian diplomats were engaged in covert operations in Greece to lobby against forcing Macedonia to change its official name READ MORE: Macedonian MPs ratify Greece name deal again Like almost every other political issue these days, this relatively arcane one is regarded through the distorting prism of alleged Russian interference : any decision which does not consolidate the power of American dominated supranational structures like the US or the EU is now routinely attributed to all pervasive Russian influence, as if all dissidents were foreign agents Western discussion of this subject now resembles the paranoia of the old Soviet regime, and of its satellites in Eastern Europe, which similarly attacked anti Communists for being fifth columnists the very phrase used by a prominent European politician last month to lambast all his enemies as Russian stooges Europe has a fifth column in its ranks: Putin s cheerleaders who want to destroy Europe & liberal democracy from within: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage, Orb√†n, Kaczynski, Salvini use Kremlin money & intel Like Farage s friend Arron Banks, who colluded w/ Russians to deliver#Brexit US influence is suspected in this case between Greece and Macedonia because the Americans are pushing to bring the whole of the Balkan peninsula under Western control † This has been policy for nearly thirty years at least since the Yugoslav wars led to a US brokered peace deal in Bosnia in 1995 In recent years the tempo has quickened, with the accession of Montenegro to NATO last year leaving only Macedonia and Serbia as missing pieces of the puzzle The Greek victory over the name of Macedonia removes the last obstacle to that country s accession to NATO and other

The darkest hour! Appeasement! The unspoken truth is that it s far more lucrative and, dare I say it, fun for so called experts to simply dump on Trump, than to try and come up with a more considered take on what happened Social media hot takes are another way of describing an ill thought out opinion, usually one that has been conceived before an event has taken place In the bad old days, it would take at the very least a few hours of contemplation to decide that a news conference involving a football being thrown at the first lady, but in which no one actually died, was the worst moment in US history Nowadays though, history is written by twitchy trigger fingers with 280 characters to play with in a matter of seconds In the era of the hot take, there were some absolute classics of the genre One of the best came from chess master and one of the West s Putin critics of choice Garry Kasparov He tweeted: I m ready to call this the darkest hour in the history of the American presidency Let me know can think of any competition ù Hmmm, what do you think Richard Nixon? †Got any ideas George Dubya?

"30 May, 2018",Who is responsible for the new US-Russian Cold War? - by Stephen Cohen,"Prof Stephen F Cohen argues that unwise US policies since the 1990s have been responsible for the new Cold War Former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul argues that Russia s leader since 2000, Putin, is to blame A discussion of the Stephen F Cohen Michael McFaul debate Stephen F Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US Russian Cold War (You can find †previous †installments †of these conversations, now in their fifth year, atTheNation com ) On May 9, at a public event jointly sponsored by Columbia University s Harriman Institute and NYU s Jordan Center for Advanced Russian Studies, Cohen and McFaul îa Stanford University professor and previously President Obama s top Russia adviser in the White House and then his ambassador to Moscow îdebated a crucial historical but also urgent contemporary subject: The New US Russian †Cold †War îWho Is to Blame? ùCohen argues that unwise American policies since the 1990s have been largely responsible McFaul, drawing on themes in his new book, From †Cold †War †to Hot Peace, argues that Russia s leader since 2000, Vladimir Putin, is to blame (A video of the full debate can be seenhere ) Batchelor plays several statements by Cohen and McFaul at the event, which he and Cohen discuss Among the main points made by Cohen are the following: î The new †Cold †War †has unfolded for more than twenty years without any substantive mainstream debate înot in elections, Congress, the media, think tanks, or universities In a democracy, such debates are the only way to challenge and change official policy As a result, Washington s unwise policies toward Moscow have been guided by the same underlying assumptions and principles since the 1990s This situation is dramatically unlike the †preceding †40 year †Cold War, when US policy was regularly debated both at high and grassroots levels from the 1960s through the 1980s And this lack of public debate is one reason why the new †Cold †War †is more dangerous than was its predecessor Therefore, Cohen emphasizes, if this event sets a precedent, inspires more such debates between representatives of fundamentally opposing American views, as he and McFaul are, there will be no loser only winners in the making of subsequent US policy toward Russia î Cohen locates the origins of the new †Cold †War †at the time when the †preceding †one was said to have ended The three leaders who declared that the †Cold War †had ended in 1989 ≠ ≠ ≠ 1990 îPresidents Gorbachev, Reagan, and George H W Bush îpublicly agreed it had been terminated through negotiations and without any losers ù But in 1992, Bush changed both the timing and terms of that epochal event, dating it from the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991, †two years later, and declaring: America won the †Cold †War ù Thus arose the US triumphalism and sense of entitlement that has informed Washington s policies toward post Soviet Russia ever since î At the same time, in 1990, another major agreement was successfully negotiated and then violated by Washington In return for Gorbachev s agreement that a reunited Germany (the political epicenter of that †Cold †War) would be a NATO member, the Western powers, led by President Bush, pledged that NATO would not expand one inch eastward ù † †Violating that pledge a few years later led to two primary causes of the new †Cold †War: today, NATO, the world s most powerful military alliance, is encamped on Russia s borders; and the Russian policy elite s abiding belief, expressed not only by Putin, that Washington has repeatedly broken its promises to, even deceived, ù Moscow î In the 1990s, the Clinton Administration s professed strategic partnership and friendship ù with Russia was in fact driven by rampant triumphalism With Russia gravely weakened and in profound crisis following the end of the Soviet Union, Clinton pursued what Cohen terms a winner take all ù approach to Moscow and, behind the scenes, toward Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself While the physically ailing and psychologically needy Yeltsin was being cajoled by Clinton on matters of Russia s domestic and foreign policies, legions of American advisers ù encamped across the country to similarly meddle ù in that nation s politics îdrafting laws and textbooks, abetting politicians and parties favored by Washington, and directly participating in the rigging of Yeltsin s 1996 reelection Many Americans applauded as progress the oligarchic plundering of Russia s richest assets, and some even enabled the transfer and laundering of that ill gained wealth in the West Then followed the onset of NATO expansion eastward and, in 1999, the US led bombing of Russia s traditional ally, Serbia, and NATO s annexation of its Kosovo province, which the Putin leadership would later cite as precedent for its action in Crimea All along, as Russia was afflicted by the worst ever peacetime economic depression, with some 75 percent of its people sinking into poverty and attendant social misery, Washington cheered the process as a transition to democracy and capitalism ù It ended in 1999, with Russia in financial collapse and with Yeltsin s resignation The resulting backlash could have been, Cohen points out, very much worse for the United States than Vladimir Putin has been î Despite the disastrous US policies of the 1990s, the winner take all approach continued under President George W Bush Thus, following the 9/11 attack on America in 2001, the new and not yet unchallengeable Russian President Putin gave more support to the US †war †against the Taliban in Afghanistan than did any other country, including NATO members Putin sought the real strategic partnership with Washington that Yeltsin had failed to achieve Instead, he got in return from Bush further NATO expansion, now headed to Russia s Baltic borders; expanded democracy promotion ù î meddling, ù to use Russiagate ù jargon îin Russia s internal affairs; and, most detrimental to Russian (and international) security, unilateral US withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty, which now has resulted in missile defense installments on land and sea very close to Russia and, predictably, a new nuclear arms race î In 2008, following an official NATO statement that one day the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine would certainly become members of the alliance, †a brief †war †between Russia and Georgia erupted An official European investigation concluded that Georgia s president had initiated the †war What is not known is whether he was advised to do so by his American patrons in the Bush Administration Whatever the case, Georgia was the first US Russian proxy †war †of the new †Cold †War Others, in effect, soon followed îin Ukraine, then in Syria More, or even worse, may be in the making î McFaul argues that Cohen s thesis of an unending triumphalist, winner take all ù approach to post Soviet Russia is wrong, as evidenced by President Obama s re set ù with Moscow under then President Dmitry Medvedev It was, according to McFaul (himself a major participant), a win win ù policy Cohen disagrees, pointing out in detail that Moscow was offered, and received, very little, while the Obama Administration got what it most wanted: Russian sanctions on Iran and an expanded Russian supply route to US and NATO forces in Afghanistan Moreover, it ended with another American broken promise In return for its partner ù Medvedev not vetoing at the UN Security Council the US led attack on Libya in 2011, Obama and his representatives, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,promisednot to seek the removal of Libya s leader, Muammar Gaddafi In the event, he was tracked down and killed Putin, then prime minister, remarked on yet another American deception ù And any chance Medvedev had for a second term as president, as the Obama administration hoped and even lobbied for, was crushed by his own re set ù partner in Washington î That is, McFaul and many others continue to insist that the new †Cold †War †and its causes began with Putin s return to the Russian presidency in 2012 But as Cohen s historical presentation shows, this is not a viable empirical or analytical understanding of past or current developments î Has the outcome really been a new †Cold †War? When Cohen first warned of this danger in the early 2000s, adumbrating his concern even during the Clinton Yelstin 1990s, it was widely said that a recapitulation of †Cold †War †was impossible for several reasons, primarily because there was no longer any fundamental ideological conflict between the United States and Russia, as there had been between democratic capitalism and Soviet Communism If nothing else, Cohen and McFaul agree there is now indeed an ideological clash between, it is said, the US led West s liberal democratic values and Putin s conservative, even reactionary, ones Cohen questions this †simplistic characterization of Putin s values, or ideology, but the issue was not directly joined and remains to be debated î A range of other disputed issues are discussed before the debate, and the Cohen Batchelor discussion, ends with the issue of Russiagate ù allegations regarding collusion ù between President Trump and Putin McFaul apparently regards the allegations as proven or nearly so Cohen does not, and he worries that if Trump is faced with an existential nuclear confrontation with Russia, as President John F Kennedy was during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, these allegations will prevent Trump from avoiding nuclear †war †through negotiations with the Kremlin, as Kennedy did McFaul did not comment on this, perhaps because the debate format did not provide him an opportunity to do so What he thinks about it is unclear But all of us, Cohen ends, should certainly, and urgently, think very carefully about this not improbable possibility Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor ofThe Nation",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428255-cold-war-cohen-mcfaul/
"23 May, 2018",Michael McFaul's memoir: Yesterday's man rages against the dying of the light," From Cold War to Hot Peace: 483 pages of a controversial former US ambassador to Moscow venting his agitation over unfulfilled potential Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv SAINT PETERSBURG As Theresa May might say, it s highly likely ù that Michael McFaul, given he s a professional scholar, is familiar with the work of George Berkeley For the uninitiated, or those who couldn t care less, he was a philosopher from Kilkenny, Ireland, famous for advancing a theory now known as subjective idealism ù Whether he knows it or not, McFaul has spent decades channeling Berkeley, except he s substituted the Irishman s mystic optimism for a messianic devotion to his own higher calling: ù that of democracy promotion ù Yet, in reality, the former US ambassador to Russia has mostly indulged in pretty selective idealism McFaul isn t interested in just any form of democracy: he only considers those which mimic the American liberal system legitimate Thus, just as the late bishop of Cloyne couldn t imagine a world without the presence of God, our hero can t envisage a planet where the United States is not calling the shots everywhere However, McFaul is offering readers a romanticized version of the American order, a system which often sees its custodians behave in the manner of a compromised preacher exulting his flock to do as he suggests rather than what his church does in practice And that s where Berkeley s most famous observation, esse est percipi (to be is to perceived), comes into play Because, make no mistake, either the ex ambassador genuinely lacks the self awareness to understand why he is so poorly regarded in Moscow, or he s playing what the English would call silly buggers ù Meaning the question is which Peter Sellers character McFaul most resembles: Chauncey Gardner (Being There) or Inspector Clouseau (The Pink Panther) And it s clearly the latter because this author is far more inept and incompetent than naive or stupid McFaul s academic speciality encompasses transitions from authoritarianism to democracy An early supporter of pro Western post Soviet Russia, he s angry with Vladimir Putin for ending the country s transformation towards an orientation subservient to Washington One assumes this is why he wrote a 52 pagepaper, in 2005, entitled American Efforts at Promoting Regime Change in the Soviet Union and then Russia: Lessons Learned Something which he omits from his book Now, arriving in Moscow with this sort of legacy pretty much amounts to turning up in Pamplona and waving red rags at the local bull population READ MORE:America s elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world This is especially so given McFaul arrived in the capital in January 2012, in the midst of large liberal opposition protests and just about two months after his old boss, HillaryClinton, had appeared to encourage the demonstrators, drawing a furious response from Putin Of course, McFaul could have tried to distance himself from what was happening but, instead, he devoted hisfirst meetingas ambassador to Putin s opponents which surely didn t impress the Kremlin Here, he indicates how he actually wasn t in favor of the event, claiming it was US Assistant Secretary William Burn s idea And this may be true, but surely McFaul could have feigned a flu to avoid it, if he really wanted, knowing the potential optics? Soon after this faux pas, Mikhail Leontiev, a Russian TV host, ran a flagrant attack on McFaul, which certainly smeared him and was absolutely factually challenged The author chastises Leontiev for building up anti American hysteria, but his argument is diluted now he s happy to appear, as a fixture, on Rachel Maddow s MSNBC show, which does the same thing in reverse whipping up anti Russian sentiment, using dodgy facts Furthermore, despite his protestations, McFaul betrays his interests when, later in his book, he considers taking a democracy promotion ù gig focused on the Middle East It suggests he s an ideologue who chose Russia as his chariot due to the circumstances of his time, rather than being a hardcore Russophile This theory is bolstered after he admits that the type of Russians who interest him come from a small circle (referring to Moscow in 1985): I met refuseniks, black marketeers, the spoiled children of Communist Party leaders ù There s nothing about heading into the regions and engaging with middle Russia, ù which tends to be conservative and sceptical of change but also elects the country s leaders Indeed, early on, he uses variations of the word democratic ù 13 times in one single paragraph which is notable for its disregard for the conventions of word repetition but also speaks volumes about the priorities at play especially given it s paired with the phrase righteous struggle ù For this reason I was expecting at least a chapter on the events of 1993 when Boris Yeltsin destroyed Russia s nascent democracy and created the hyper presidential ù system which has made Putin so powerful Back then, Yeltsinshelledhis own parliament with tanks, in defiance of democratic norms, and 158 people died (130 of them civilians) Instead of scrutinizing the effects of those actions, McFaul devotes a few paragraphs, concluding how everyone made mistakes and everyone lost ù Presumably, he felt he couldn t delve into it because Bill Clinton explained to the American people ù that Yeltsin was on the right side of history ù More delusive meandering comes when McFaul admits how, in 1994, after Yeltsin unilaterally invaded though the idea of invading part of your own country seems a bit bizarre Chechnya, he himself lectured Russians on national TV about how decisions to go to war are made in the US the President (must) consult with Congress before taking military action ù This is surely news to Donald Trump, who has twice attacked Syria (illegally) without consulting either chamber of Washington s bicameral legislature Then there s the 1996 Russian election, when American advisors meddled to assist Yeltsin s victory: something later celebrated in aHollywood movieand an iconic Time magazinecover But McFaul doesn t feel it merits comment, despite his almost daily protestations on US network TV about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential contest That said, there is some valuable information in From Cold War to Hot Peace such as the author s insider accounts of Putin Obama meetings His revelation that Putin insisted Dmitry (Medvedev) ù was in charge of foreign policy, during his presidency, is interesting in the context of the latter s later acquiescence to the West s 2011 Libyan intervention seen as a colossal mistake inside Russia Indeed, McFaul does acknowledge how American manipulation of Medvedev over Libya ended all hopes of him challenging for a second term in the Kremlin Another stand out observation is the description of Putin s 2007 Munich speech, where he lashed out at Washington s attempts to create a unipolar world, as shocking ù and infamous ù However, the most interesting revelation is that the Americans offered Putin a White House visit in May 2012, before the G8 summit, which took place in Maryland But he refused, and also avoided the main event: for reasons McFaul deems spurious This is noteworthy because it suggests Putin had already given up on Russia s integration with the West about two years before it was commonly realized And it also means Russia s 2014 suspension ù from the G8 wasn t much of a punishment at all Something Foreign Minister SergeyLavrovhas already intimated I was very cautious about reviewing this book because oddly for a man with Celtic blood McFaul is a sensitive soul So, in the interests of disclosure, I need to explain how he has blocked me on Twitter, apparently, because Idescribedhim as arguably, the least successful US ambassador to Russia in history ù in an exchange with a Russian journalist, something I d hardly consider a controversial statement As a result, I had decided not to review the book until McFaul popped up with a Marchtweetto RT †saying he couldn t wait for your reviews ù Well, now he need linger no more From Cold War To Hot Peace is widely available, both online and in bookstores",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/427565-michael-mcfaul-book-russia/

even the US State Department seems to be having second thoughts about supporting the group, reportedly placing a freeze on its funding The State Department s support for the White Helmets is under active review, ùaccordingto a CBS News report The group reportedly hasn t received funding in weeks, but neither has it received formal confirmation that Washington s financial assistance has come to a complete halt This would mean a significant blow for the group, as the money accounts for about one third of the White Helmets overall funding An internal State Department document cited by CBS said that its Near East Bureau needed confirmation from President Donald Trump s administration by April 15 in order to approve funding for the White Helmets If that wasn t received, the department would initiate shut down procedures on a rolling basis ù Online reaction to the report has been mixed, with some continuing to hail the work of the White Helmets Among them was Samantha Power, the former US ambassador to the UN This is beyond belief and must be fixed immediately The White Helmets (@SyriaCivilDef) are volunteers who have heroically and selflessly saved tens of thousands of liveshttps:// t

co /lj8zlOjYsa The report comes amid major controversy surrounding the White Helmets, after residents of Douma, Syria, testified in The Hague at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) The hearing centered on the alleged chemical attack that was used as a justification for the April 14 strikes by the US, Britain, and France In a press conference following the hearing, hospital staff and 11 year old Hassan Diab who is seen in troubling White Helmets footage following the alleged attack said there was no sign of a chemical incident at the time and that the White Helmets video with children was apparently staged The footage, which showed Diab and other children being hosed down with water, was the only publicly available evidence ùthat the attack ever took place Still, Trump and his British and French counterparts deemed it sufficient proof to launch over 100 missiles on Syria on April 14, accusing the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad of being behind the alleged attack The three allies were so keen to bomb Syria that they refused to wait for the results of an OPCW investigation before doing so If the report from CBS News is true, it could represent a significant U turn for Washington Just last month, US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert called the group an incredible group of individuals ùAt that time, she also stated that as far as she was aware, the White Helmets were still being paid by Washington, despite a $200 million freeze in US funding for recovery efforts in Syria in late March Although the White Helmets says it acts solely as a makeshift emergency response team in a time of crisis, claiming to have heroically saved more than 70,000 lives in war torn Syria, others disagree with its motives Footage

celebrity status in the West, with a documentary praising it even winning an Oscar However, some artists have refused to give in to peer pressure and publicly spoke out against endorsing the shady

McFaul had a ready answer albeit, shall we say, a peculiar one Apparently, bombings and military invasions don t count as meddling and are thus irrelevant to the debate Correct The US invaded Iraq, bombed Libya, intervened militarily & gave military assistance to Syrians Meddling is not the right word Ukraine a very different story of US assistance to NGOs https:// t co /SmltrobAiM That last bit about Ukraine and NGOs was a bit of an approximation, too, considering how quick American officials were to get in touch with the Ukrainian opposition as the Euromaidan uprising that unseated pro Russian president Yanukovich unfolded in Kiev Accompanied by US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland rushed to Maidan Square to hand out sandwiches and talk to the protest leaders A few weeks later, Nuland was all smiles with the now splintered group that would soon come to power on the back of the Euromaidan rallies The man on the left in that last picture is Oleg Tyagnibok, the leader of Svoboda, a party with a militant nationalistic streak Like the rest of this argument, it s probably a matter of semantics, whether the words orchestrate ù and coup ù are too strong here No, the US did not orchestrate a coup in Ukraine That is simply not true https:// t co /jgiOlsDACh McFaul himself, together with an assistant state secretary, met with the Russian opposition at the beginning of his tenure in Moscow The meeting came at the height of a protest movement, soon after the large scale rallies in Moscow s Bolotnaya Square and Sakharov Avenue, which have since become iconic with the opposition Had this been modern times, would the word collusion ù have been appropriate? ù ",https://www.rt.com/usa/419361-mcfaul-meddling-us-russia/
"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// t co /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director Michael Morrell Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who recently announced he was partially abandoning his Russian scholarship and has lost interest in maintaining my (sic) ability to speak/write Russian ù is

course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don t agree with their government s policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad s government as well as Iranian and Russian influence pic

a Syria expert in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain O

"15 Dec, 2017",NATO's broken promises: Time to admit West bears serious responsibility for tension in E. Europe,"The question whether Western leaders promised the Soviet Union that NATO would not expand east has been debated for years Newly declassified papers prove what many Western officials and scholars have denied: A promise was broken is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Researchers from the George Washington University based National Security Archive have compiled 30 documents which prove Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev wasgiven a cascade of assurances ù that NATO would not march east High profile officials and scholars at think tanks have repeatedly denied those assurances were ever made They have implied Russian leaders have been living in a fantasy land and that their anger at continued NATO expansion has been unjustified As recently as last year, the former American ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaulcalledit a complete myth ù that any such promises were made It is not just the newly declassified information that lends credence to Russia s version of events Much of the information confirming Russia s stance has been public for years It just has not been made widely known There have, however, been those who looked at the evidence with an impartial eye Western leaders misled Gorbachev with promises that NATO wouldn t expand released archiveshttps:// t co /OnVd67GJ2vpic twitter com/KIzv2RS2eq German magazine Der Spiegelconcludedas far back as 2009, based on its own examination of the documents and conversations with those involved, that: there was no doubt the West did everything it could to give the Soviets the impression that NATO membership was out of the question for countries like Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia ù To understand why this matters so much to Moscow and how it has contributed to recent tensions in Europe, it s important to understand the historical context As the Cold War came to a close, the question of whether a reunited Germany would align with the West or East rose to the fore As the self appointed winners of the Cold War, American policymakers decided that Germany should be aligned with the United States In presenting this idea to the Soviets, US ambassador James Baker said he could make iron clad guarantees ù that NATO would not expand one inch eastward ù It was based on those assurances that negotiations continued: In exchange for Germany s Western alignment, NATO would not be expanded Defenders of subsequent NATO enlargement have claimed that discussions of eastward expansion during German reunification negotiations in 1990 were limited only to the status of East Germany But the GWU researchers have concluded that the talks were not at all narrowly limited to the status of East German territory ù Whether the American negotiators ever intended to stick to their word we can t know What we do know, is that the temptation to pull the entire Eastern bloc into the US own orbit very quickly proved too great In the same year that Baker had promised not one inch eastward ù American policymakers were already quietly considering how they could bring Eastern Europe into NATO At the same time, they were making plans to assure Moscow its security concerns would be taken into account and that any new European security structure would be inclusive of Russia But a common security structure which would include Russia was never truly on the cards One can make their own assumptions as to why Washington has preferred to keep Russia on the sidelines One reason, as I havewrittenbefore, is that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO found itself with its thumbs twiddling Its raison d etre was no more The alliance could have disbanded then and there and begun negotiations with the Russian Federation for a new, inclusive security structure which would aim to prevent future tensions within Europe by paying attention to Russia s security concerns Instead, NATO opted to expand further and further î right to Russia s own backyard A US led military alliance at Russia s doorstep was a far cry from the not one inch further ù that Baker had promised The goal, of course, was to bring as many Eastern European nations as possible under a pro Washington umbrella î from where they would never be able to question US foreign policy, allowing Washington to control the region with ease This is key to understanding Vladimir Putin s worldview Indeed, this history forms much of the basis of his general mistrust of the West today As such, without understanding the historical context within which NATO was expanded, it is impossible to understand the recent conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine î two deeply divided countries which have been on NATO s future membership to do list Washington is a fan of drawing red lines ù around the world which others may not be permitted to cross It defends its own interests vociferously For Putin, NATO membership for Ukraine or Georgia has been a red line Western leaders and officials, for the most part, have refused to take any responsibility for leaving Europe in security limbo after the Cold War ended Instead, they have tried to place the blame entirely with Moscow, aggressively promoting the idea that modern Russia is on a mission to regain lost glory by gobbling up Eastern Europe î and that valiant NATO is the only thing in Putin s way But the latest research by GWU should make it clear: The West, through its broken promises and untrustworthiness at a crucial moment in history, bears significant responsibility for current European tensions and the conflicts that have arisen from them There were, of course, those who warned against NATO expansion î and indeed the alliance s existence at all Only a matter of months after NATO s formation in 1949, US Senator Robert A Taft î the son of President William Howard Taft î made a speech in which he predicted that the NATO alliance would eventually be more likely to produce war than peace ù in Europe But perhaps the most poignant and forceful warning against NATO expansion came in 1998 from the legendary diplomat George F Kennan Kennan, then aged 94, told the New York Times Thomas Friedman that NATO expansion was a tragic mistake ù There was no reason for this whatsoever No one was threatening anybody else This expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves, ù he said Kennan warned that the US was turning its back on Russia and the people who had mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime ù He continued with prophetic words: It shows so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet history Of course, there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are but this is just wrong NATO expansion, of course, continued well beyond 1999, beyond Kennan s death in 2005 î and is still continuing today, with Montenegro the latest to join the military bloc The GWU report makes for interesting reading There can no longer be any denying that many Western leaders and officials gave assurances to the Soviets that NATO would not be expanded; that there would be no threat to its security It was in this context that Gorbachev agreed to German alignment with the West In his apparent naivety, Gorbachev believed that the Soviet Union s own future and integration with the West and Western institutions depended on it He still believed in the dream of the common European home ù and felt there was no reason for the end of the Cold War not to be mutually beneficial But Western leaders had other ideas Russia would never be permitted into the

"14 Dec, 2017",Gorbachev WAS promised NATO would not expand east ‚Äì declassified docs,"In 1990, Western politicians repeatedly assured Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO wouldn t expand east of Germany s borders, but broke that promise less than a decade later, say insider archives from both sides of negotiations following the dismantling of the Berlin Wall Researchers from the respected George Washington University based National Security Archive, which specializes in obtaining key declassified information from the government, have put together30 crucial documentsthat clearly show several top Western officials vowing to Gorbachev in unison that NATO would not expand eastward Some of these have been publicly available for several years, others have been revealed as a result of Freedom of Information requests for the study Through 1990 as the two Germanies, and the leaders of four World War II victors, the USSR, the US, the UK and France, negotiated a reunification treaty, signed by the six parties in Moscow in September, the capitalist states tried to defuse Moscow s fears that a reunified state in the heart of Europe would present a threat to the Soviet Union In February, George H W Bush s secretary of state, James Baker, assured his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, that in a post Cold War Europe NATO would no longer be belligerent less of a military organization, much more of a political one, would have no need for independent capability ù Nonetheless, Baker promised Shevardnadze iron clad guarantees that NATO s jurisdiction or forces would not move eastward ùOn the same day in Moscow, he famously told the Soviet General Secretary that the alliance would not move one inch to the east ù The following day, February 10, 1990, Helmut Kohl, the future chancellor of a united Germany, repeated the same thought to Gorbachev, even as they disagreed on other issues We believe that NATO should not expand the sphere of its activity We have to find a reasonable resolution I correctly understand the security interests of the Soviet Union, and I realize that you, Mr General Secretary, and the Soviet leadership will have to clearly explain what is happening to the Soviet people, ùKohl said Later that month, talking with Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, President George H W Bush himself said that we will not conduct ourselves in the wrong way by saying, We win, you lose ù Tell Gorbachev that I asked you to tell Gorbachev that we will not conduct ourselves regarding Czechoslovakia or any other country in a way that would complicate the problems he has so frankly discussed with me, ùthe US president said, talking to the Czech reformer and former dissident The French president, Socialist Francois Mitterand, went further and said that he was not in favor of even a unified Germany joining NATO, something he openly shared with the Soviet leader In the end, the Soviets moved their forces out of Germany, and later other eastern European states, without a single hostile incident Among those going home was KGB officer Vladimir Putin, who was stationed in Dresden between 1985 and 1990 The promise lasted only until 1997, however, when Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were invited into the alliance In total, 13 Eastern European states have become NATO members since then Gorbachev and subsequently Putin have frequently bemoaned the West s broken promise, with the latter insisting that it fundamentally undermined the fragile trust between an internationally retreating Russia and an ascendant US Meanwhile, in New Cold War news, declassified US documents prove that Russia WAS promised NATO wouldn t expand eastwards after 1991 Since then it has added 13 new members All former communist states But, you know, expansionist Russia, Putin etchttps:// t co /pm0yUqXlPjpic twitter com/gVFpFHALKh Nonetheless NATO and top Western officials have continued to claim that there was no promise None of the assurances of non expansion were included in any treaty documents, which means they were just that words NATO allies take decisions by consensus and these are recorded There is no record of any such decision having been taken by NATO Personal assurances, from NATO leaders, cannot replace alliance consensus and do not constitute a formal NATO agreement, ùthe alliance said in its officialexplaineron its website Robert Zoellick, a key negotiator during the reunification talks, has also spoken of the promise as a misperception, ùwhile former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul has labeled the idea of a reneged promise a myth ùin aninterviewgiven last year But the weight of evidence now uncovered suggests that these stances are disingenuous at best and duplicitous at worst ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/413029-nato-gorbachev-expansion-promises/
"5 Dec, 2017","After Tuesday‚Äôs rumble in Kiev, Western media‚Äôs lack of interest is ominous for Saakashvili","Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko s attempt to frame his political opponent Mikhail Saakashvili as a Kremlin agent is truly beyond parody However, the refusal of most prominent western media outlets to cover the breaking story from Kiev spells danger for Mischa As I write, on Tuesday afternoon, the dramatic events are completely absent from the front pages of America s CNN, New York Times, and Washington Post This stands in contrast to their often hysterical live coverage of far less dramatic protests by Russia s small liberal opposition There s not a single word about Ukraine s attempted arrest of opposition figure@SaakashviliMon the front pages of@CNN,@BBCNews@washingtonpostor@nytimes But when Alexei Navalny holds small rallies in Russia, it s usually their main headlinepic twitter com/E3lGoE5A0A When Aleksey Navalny stages, relatively poorly attended, rallies in Moscow, the breathless reportage gives consumers of western media the impression that the activist is far more significant than he really is in Russia Yet, as Mikhail Saakashvili (incidentally also polling at around 2 per cent support nationally in his adopted country) leads thousands of angry demonstrators around the streets of Kiev, the same outlets turn a blind eye By doing so, they expose how closely their world news coverage matches the foreign policy objectives of the US government Because while Vladimir Putin s administration is despised by the London and Washington establishments, Petro Poroshenko s Ukrainian regime is supported by Whitehall and the State Department Thus, the Kiev authorities are covered in an entirely different way to their Moscow counterparts And their full throttle clampdown on dissent (from banning the Communist Party to imprisoning journalists) is soft soaped Meanwhile, any missteps in Russia are greeted with hysteria Nevertheless, Tuesday s events place many mainstream media editors in a bit of a pickle Because readers with an interest in the former Soviet space, will recognise that Saakashvili has long been a western favourite, beloved of John McCain and other Cold Warriors ùSo, as a result, it will surely be confusing for many when the former Georgian president is no longer the golden boy To recap, Saakhashvili led the 2003 colour revolution in his homeland, which deposed the then president Eduard Shevardnadze But, following his victory in the 2004 Georgian election, he soon aped many of the negative traits of his predecessor, brutally clamping down on protestors and misusing state funds Four years later, Saakashvili led his country intoa disastrous invasionof South Ossetia, which drew Tbilisi into a brief conflict with Moscow That was the beginning of the end for † Mischa †in Tblisi, and today he s wanted on criminal charges in Georgia, accused of exceeding state powers ùduring a 2007 crackdown on the opposition and embezzling budget revenues Ukraine offered Saakashvili a way out of his legal problems back home and he re surfaced in Kiev, as a staunch supporter of the Euromaidan ù movements Some time after the western backed activists managed to overthrow the government in an illegal coup, he claimed Ukrainian citizenship and Poroshenko appointed his then ally, as governor of the strategically vital Odessa Oblast However, the relationship between the two men swiftly deteriorated Saakashvili, had apparently learned from his mistakes in Georgia and genuinely seemed to want to bring reforms to Ukraine But, in Poroshenko, he faced a cynical Oligarch with no intention of killing the Golden Goose, which enables himself and his allies to enrich themselves at their country s expense READ MORE: Cut off tentacles & go after the big head : Saakashvili calls for power grab in Kiev This culminated in Poroshenko stripping Saakashvili of his citizenship earlier this year, which rendered him stateless The Georgian returned to Kiev and today s stitch up was a disastrous attempt by the president to finally remove his opponent from the political fray Ukraine s general prosecutor claims that Saakashvili s activities in Ukraine are being funded by close associates of deposed leader Viktor Yanukovich, who is in exile in Russia An idea so laughable that even the likes of †Carl Bildt †and †Michael McFaul †dismissed it Tuesday afternoon Trying to arrest Saakhasvili on the pretext that he s some sort of Russian agent looks extremely amateurish Who will believe that story?pic twitter com/wJrHFko2Za Not me https:// t co /mLUS3diZAx Mikhail Saakashvili is a flawed politician who is a fugitive from his home country But his good standing in the west has saved him from justice in Tbilisi Yet, his moves in Ukraine represent a huge gamble Because the Poroshenko regime serves the west s interests and London, Washington and Brussels have so far ignored its excesses for this very reason The fact that most mainstream media has failed to prominently cover Tuesday s events suggests that Saakashvili may find himself thrown under a bus this time Bryan

this is yet another attempt to pass off American dissent as some Kremlin Psy op ù Which is beyond ridiculous Furthermore, the names behind AFSD betray the project s real purpose: to shift blame from internal American and European factors to the convenient Russian bogeyman Which, of course, suits its financialbackers, including the State Department, NATO, and the ubiquitous weapons maker Raytheon All of whom benefit commercially and politically from strained ties between Moscow and Washington To achieve these goals they ve hired the usual roll call of reliably anti Russia blowhards Including Estonian American politician Ilves Toomas and rent a quote talking head Michael McFaul, the Mother Theresa of the Russia beat Those two are joined by neoconservative windbag William Kristol and ex CIA chief Michael Morell The dashboard itself is helmed by a chap namedJ M Berger, who was apparently an expert on ISIS and the Middle East, before discovering the Russia bashing gravy train this summer This week, he s taken to the pages of Politico to explain his plaything What follows is best described as an inept and ignorant form of thrift store McCarthyism Berger tells us how his dashboard displays the near real time output of Russian Influence Operations on Twitter ù Something he calls RIOT, for short And he cites things like RT s coverage of Vladimir Putin s recent pike fishing trip, a jaunt also prominentlyfeaturedin The New York Times,The Daily Mailand The Sun, which incidentally described Putin as a beefcake ù Meaning, either Paul Dacre and Rupert Murdoch are Russian agents, or this contention is just farcical The lobbyist also frets over this network s widely shared report on Oliver Stone s Facebook post condemning US sanctions against Russia and claiming US intelligence agencies are engaged in a false flag war against Russia ù Which exposes a total lack of comprehension of how news works Because Stone is one of Hollywood s most famous figures and his name attached to a perspective like this was bound to attract plenty of attention, regardless of the messenger It s also worth pointing out (for the really obtuse) that RT obviously doesn t control Stone s Facebook and was merely bringing to a wider audience the American writer and director s personal beliefs The examples become ever stranger Berger bemoans conspiracy theories seeking to discredit Bana al Abed, a young girl in Syria who tweeted about the civil war ù But it doesn t seem unreasonable to suggest the then seven year old was manipulated to serve a propaganda effort Especially after a pressinterviewrevealed how the child couldn t understand even rudimentary English, despite issuing hundreds of perfectly crafted tweets in the language Our hero descends further into hogwash when observing how the most retweeted Russia Today stories recorded by the dashboard involved scaremongering videos appearing to show refugees swarming into Spain ù But, two weeks ago, a boatful ofmigrantsdid land on a Spanish tourist beach, near Cadiz, and quickly scattered to evade police detection And numerous outlets, including TheNew York Times,The Guardianand theBBCprominently reported the story But apparently, it s only an issue when RT gives it coverage But the garrulous quack isn t finished, asserting how RT treads relatively carefully in their flirtation with the far right, and they devote a significant amount of space to the far left as well ù Hardly news, given how the channel openly admits offering a platform for alternative voices, regardless of their political compass Incidentally, a mirror image of what America s state broadcaster s RFE/RL and VOA do in Russia where they laboriously detail the travails ofnationalistpoliticians like Alexei Navalny and their leftist counterparts, such as Sergei Udaltsov This is what alternative media does in every market, but it seems to be only unusual when the Russians ù are involved Berger does concede one salient point: it is important to note here again that we are not asserting Russia is responsible for creating or shaping this content, ù he writes Which suggests he fully understands how his project is geared to smear anybody who opposes US policy as working for Moscow s interests But, not content with mulching around the bottom of the barrel, he reaches into the depths when he states while the alt right has a very real base of support in the United States, it also enjoys deep and undisputed ties to Russia, many of which can be found offline in the real world Amazingly, the link he uses to justify his contention is a Daily Beastarticleon how American white supremacist Richard Spencer was married to an ethnic Russian The lady involved has no profile in Russia, doesn t live in the country and is a follower of a fringe philosopher called Alexander Dugin Who is so far outside the Russian mainstream that he can t even hold down a job in Moscow Dugin: so close to Putin he can t hold down a job in Moscow Thus, is now so broke, he needs ask for 200 for media interviews Go figurehttps:// t co /EWI7VV5aD1 The fact Berger has to descend to such irrelevant tittle tattle to score a few points tells us all we need to

Especially given he d be eventually found out, and it d cost him his job Furthermore, the same analyst expressed no difficulty with Obama relying on a Russian interpreter in the past As Bremmer continues: More to the point: Trump has put himself in a compromising position If he said something that he doesn t understand could be used against him or the United States, the Russians can leak it ùBut Obama might have been accused of the same in 2015 Which means it s clear what Bremmer s real issue is that he liked Obama and dislikes Trump so holds the pair to differing standards Incidentally, the op ed begins with the words as I first revealed this week, it turns out there were two meetings between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin ùBut Bremmer didn t reveal anything Indeed, if anyone deserves credit, it s the European journalist Nardelli However, the charade isn t about ethics or news values Rather it s a bounder sensing a chance to build his profile, and that of his consultancy service, by exploiting the Russia paranoia currently bedeviling American discourse Something backed up by the five Tweets the chancer posted pushing the Eurasia Group ùon the 18th and 19th of July, in between the retweets of the numerous TV appearances Viewed from this side of the planet, the hysteria looks increasingly ridiculous And it s now reached the stage where US opinion formers seem to believe the President needs a chaperone when he meets with other leaders Which is absurd Especially given Trump is no fool, and he s probably a lot smarter than the vast majority of these pundits Which explains why he s doing the job and they are talking about him doing it Bremmer s antics in recent days were beneath contempt and served to further damage US Russian relations But he s not alone in this pursuit There s no shortage of yacking mountebanks, shameless fibbers and bellicose carpetbaggers on this beat And right now it s all gravy for these quacks ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/397098-putin-trump-encounters-g20/

than any equivalent Trump Russia collusion Both pale in comparison to Washington s meddling in the former USSR But the US media focuses on the most illusory of the situations Bryan MacDonald is an

Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv It s pretty obvious Donald Trump Jr isn t the brightest light in the firmament The lethargic, spoiled and languid persona he projects doesn t help either Nevertheless, the current hysteria surrounding his meeting a small time Russian lawyer is beyond any bounds of reason Especially coming from journalists who have surely met a dodgy source or two in their time, in the hope of a scoop Natalia Veselnitskaya was almost certainly not representing the Kremlin when she courted baby Trump Rather she waslobbyingon behalf of a client, mixed up in the Sergei Magnitsky case To that end, the ex UK tabloid hack Robert Goldstoneexaggeratedher usefulness to attract Donald Jr s attention By Trump s own account, he quickly sussed this distorted pretext and pulled back Plus, it s worth mentioning how she s also engaged plenty ofDemocratsas part of her campaign Nevertheless, certain media elements have been guilty of greater inflation than Veselnitskaya Including theNew York Times, which laughably labeled her a fearsome Moscow insider, ùwithout explaining how it was Moscow Oblast, not Moscow city, where she enjoyed this clout Because despite the shared name, the region and the metropolis are two different entities, roughly analogous to the relationship between Virginia and Washington DC Thus, the Times misleading headline was much the same as a Russian outlet hailing a Richmond based attorney as some kind of White House specialist There is another thing which makes this endless Trump Russia delirium even more dubious And that s how the US establishment will leap on any connection, no matter how vague, concerning the President s team and Russians, but ignores dealings between the Democratic Party and Ukraine The elephant in the room which has been almost completely ignored, and was amazingly not even mentioned when Petro Poroshenko visited Washington last month Let s be clear, Ukraine feared a Trump presidency Because, on the campaign trail, the candidate had openly suggestedrecognizingRussia s reabsorption of Crimea and spoke of the Donbass crisis as a problem for Europe, not America As a result, Kiev bet the house on Hillary Clinton And lost As Politicoreportedin January: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election And they helped Clinton s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers ù Now, this is pretty explosive stuff A credible American news organization is reporting how a foreign government directly interfered in the US election But the popular press didn t pursue the story Presumably, because its runs counter to the established narrative A Ukrainian American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort, and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation, ùthe piece continued The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia ù And here was the zinger: Politico s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections ù Later, Politicofocusedon the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American activist, who admitted acting as a link between Ukraine s Washington Embassy and the Democratic National Committee And also how Sergei Leshchenko, elected in 2014 as an MP for Poroshenko s party, had offered ledgers purportedly showing connections between Trump and Manafort before urging Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort ùIncidentally, Manafort has always been especially appalled at attempts to link his work to Russia, saying all my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West ù Leschenko wasn t coy about his intentions He openly admitted trying toexposeTrump as a pro Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world, ùby preferring Moscow to Ukraine Furthermore, as The Atlantic noted: the investigation into the payments listed in the ledger îwhich in April were partially corroborated by theAPthrough wire transfers that Manafort claimed were legitimate îmysteriously faded after the U S election, raising questions about whether Ukrainian officials aired concerns about Manafort less to root out corruption than to undermine the Trump campaign ù Overall, Democrat Ukraine collusion seems far deeper than anything so far proven between the Trump campaign and Russia For instance, Donald Jr stands exposed as having been willing to meet someone described as affiliated with the Kremlin to get information on Hillary, which was pretty dumb The meeting itself appeared to be a bait and switch so the lawyer could lobby on other matters However, the Ukraine story involved a concerted and deliberate campaign, including cooperation between Kiev representatives and the Clinton camp to research Trump Kremlin connections Thus, If the issue is collusion, it s obvious there was much greater connivance concerning Ukraine and the Democrats than a single exchange involving Donald Jr and an insignificant lawyer One where no information was actually provided That said, American outrage over meddling from Kiev and Moscow is laughable in the context of Washington s long history of interference in both countries politics In 1996, the US openly intervened in Russia s election to help Boris Yeltsin defeat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov And in 2011, Washington officials, including Clinton, publicly supported a protest campaign over disputed parliamentary elections The following year,Michael McFaularrived as ambassador to Moscow and unabashedly courted fringe opposition leaders in his very first event in the role In Ukraine, the interruptions have had even more serious consequences By the admission of Victoria Nuland, a member of the Obama administration, Washington spent over$5 billionon influence projects in the country The first regime change ùoperation came in 2004 and was known as the Orange Revolution ùAnd in 2013, US politicians and officials, such as John McCain and Nuland herself, turned up in Kiev to encourage the Maidan movement, in which the USambassadorGeoffrey Pyatt was prominent That led to the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government, which divided the country and caused the separation of Crimea and a civil war in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions And it also contributed to an economic collapse which has seen the average Ukrainian salary fall to around $200 a month and led to unprecedented levels of emigration For sure, Ukrainians didn t hide their hostility toTrump Interior Minister Arsen Avakov deriding the eventual winner as a dangerous marginal ùanddescribinghim as a clown ùon Twitter Many Russians publicly slammed Clinton, which was hardly surprising after shecomparedVladimir Putin to Hitler The fact remains there is no evidence of a direct Kremlin campaign to undermine America s election The media has almost totally ignored Kiev s transparent meddling to chase Russian ghosts All the while downplaying US manipulation of the political process throughout the former Soviet

"5 Jul, 2017",Putin & Trump finally meet: Here's why Russia and America can't get along,"So, at last, it s happening On Friday, almost six months after assuming office, Donald Trump will have his first meeting with Vladimir Putin Instead of a summit, it s snatched minutes on the G20 sidelines Testament to the current anti Russia hysteria in America Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv In January, at his maiden news conference as president, Trump mentioned seven times how it would be positive, ù good ùand even great ùif America couldget alongwith Russia ùAt the time, there was much bewilderment concerning his stances toward China, the European Union and the Arab World But on Russia, he was notably consistent He accepted the United States was partly to blame for dismal bilateral relations and insisted Washington would need Moscow s help to wipe out ISIS Since then, China s Xi Jinping, Britain s Theresa May, Germany s Angela Merkel, Japan s Shinzo Abe, among others, have visited the Oval Office and Trump will be in Paris later this month to meet Emmanuel Macron In addition, the president has visited Saudi Arabia and Israel and met all the NATO heads of state in Brussels But the toxic atmosphere in the US has restricted interaction with Putin to a few phone calls Because, in a climate where some pundits even ludicrouslyclaimthe president is a Kremlin agent, Trump knows a visit to Moscow would lead to a media frenzy And a Putin trip to the White House is almost unfathomable Thus, a lot is riding on a short man to man encounter in Hamburg This week, assorted Russia experts, ùwith varying degrees of entitlement to the designation, have been giving Trump advice ùbefore his touch down in Germany They ve included the likes ofIan Bremmer, Steven Pifer andMichael McFaul And some have made excellent points However, there s an overriding weakness to all their arguments; and that s the inability to see things from the Russian perspective Sadly, this is the persistent failure of American analysis of Russia Because Westerners get Russia wrong when they project their own values and priorities onto this country Instead, what they need to do is think like Russians And it means taking their hopes, fears and perspectives seriously and giving them equal weight Or otherwise, the net result is an endless cycle of recrimination and vitriol, which will continue to destabilize the world order Recently, Bruce Allyn of Harvard University, wrote an excellentop ed, introducing an updated version of the partisan perception chart, ùsomething designed to advance dialogue in confrontational relationships Quoting Abraham Lincoln, he wrote: ùI don t like that man I must get to know him better ùAnd suggested such an approach would be useful in US/Russian relations to to get to know the other side better, to allow both sides to air their grievances, challenge the other side, correct inaccuracies and then move beyond their emotionally charged, opposing positions to begin to address critical underlying interests ù Allyn outlined some basic disagreements between Moscow and Washington Here, I want to go further and include a few more And illustrate where the two powers are divided before Friday s Putin Trump chinwag RUSSIA:You are a military threat right on our border As seen from inside Russia, NATO s eastward expansion is aggressive It was bad enough bringing the Baltic states in, but attempting to add Georgia and Ukraine was the final straw And adding the likes of Montenegro is needlessly provocative This upset is also fueled by the historic memory of two great invasions of Russia those of Napoleon and Hitler coming from the European frontier AMERICA:You are a military threat to our European Allies Whereas Putin sees NATO s European members as vassals of America, Washington publicly considers them allies, who have freely joined the club Which certainly stacks up when it comes to political elites, if not the general populace in many of these countries The US justifies NATO s mission as guaranteeing stability in Europe and sees Moscow as a danger in this regard However, Trump s personal commitment to NATO is less than clear He previously described it as obsolete, ùbefore appearing to backtrack, albeit halfheartedly RUSSIA:You are a strategic nuclear threat to us AMERICA:You are a strategic nuclear threat to us This is pretty self explanatory Both countries are capable of reducing the other to radioactive ash RUSSIA:You are backing the wrong side in Syria The Kremlin believes the only stable solution for Syria is an intact state, ruled from Damascus And helmed by Bashar Assad, at least in the short term It considers the jihadi groups the Pentagon has backed to be terrorists ùand believes if they take power it will lead to a Libya style situation with a collapsed state A perfect scenario for ISIS to thrive Moscow also has real domestic security concerns related to radical Islamist terrorism AMERICA:You are backing the wrong side in Syria Under Barack Obama, the White House maintained that Assad must go ùAnd the foreign policy establishment in Washington still pushes this agenda Nevertheless, Trump himself is a wild card He has openly prioritized the destruction of ISIS Yet, his administration has attacked the same Assad forces which are fighting the terrorist group RUSSIA:You have interfered in our elections and domestic politics American meddling in Russian governance is a matter of record In 1993, Washington supported Boris Yeltsin when he forced a rigged referendum on a super presidential ùconstitution And in 1996, America helped him to defeat opposition leader Gennady Zyuganov, even sending advisers Of course, a blind eye was shown to electoral violations, such as 110 percent turnouts in remote districts Since Putin won power, US officials have displayed a clear preference for the small liberal opposition And the KremlinbelievesHillary Clinton personally encouraged 2011 protests against the results of a parliamentary election AMERICA:You have interfered in our elections and domestic politics Despite a lack of tangible evidence, almost the entire US establishment believes Moscow played a part in directing the 2016 presidential election According to Wikipedia: a January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership preferred presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an influencecampaign to harm Clinton s electoral chances and undermine public faith in the US democratic process Nevertheless, the Kremlin denies these charges and points to the absence of any proof RUSSIA:You bombard the media space with anti Russian propaganda English speaking Russians frequently complain the country they see described in Western media bares little resemblance to the one they live in And it s fair to say there is a lack of balance in mainstream press reportage from Russia A hive mentality amongst Anglophone journalists in Moscow, further amplified by the rise of Twitter and Facebook, doesn t help either AMERICA:You bombard the media space with anti Western propaganda A few years ago, the US think tank racket began to promote the notion of Russian news outlets (basically RT and Sputnik) undermining the West That said, given RT and Sputnik are literally just two organizations, with comparatively tiny budgets, up against thousands promoting a pro American outlook, this does seem preposterous Of course, other issues are dividing the two countries For instance, Moscow s warm embrace of China, happening at the same time the European Union and America are becoming more vexatious, alarms many in Washington There are also mutual concerns about energy production and distribution, sanctions (which the Kremlin believes are being used to gain competitive advantages) and North Korea Putin and Trump will have to find some compromises to offer any hope of improving relations However, the McCarthy esque madness currently enveloping Washington and the US

As we have just seen in America, they don t seem to need to provide evidence for their findings to become accepted gospel truth these days In fact, this entire article is precisely based on the assumption of how the DNC hacks, many analysts believe, were just a skirmish in a larger war against Western institutions and alliances ù(to quote the intro) As we all know, there is no actual proof of Kremlin involvement in the DNC hacks Indeed, WikiLeaks itself hassaidthe Russian government was not its source And its envoyclaimedthat a disgusted ùwhistleblower was responsible NEW YORKER:In early January, two weeks before the Inauguration, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, released a declassified report concluding that Putin had ordered an influence campaign to harm Clinton s election prospects, fortify Donald Trump s, and undermine public faith in the US democratic process ù The declassified report provides more assertion than evidence Intelligence officers say that this was necessary to protect their information gathering methods Critics of the report had repeatedly noted that intelligence agencies, in the months before the Iraq War, endorsed faulty assessments concerning weapons of mass destruction But the intelligence community was deeply divided over the actual extent of Iraq s weapons development; the question of Russia s responsibility for cyberattacks in the 2016 election has produced no such tumult Seventeen federal intelligence agencies have agreed that Russia was responsible for the hacking REALITY:This is not entirely true As many others have pointed out, the NSA (i e , the agency most likely to know, because it can monitor communications) hasofferedonly moderate support NEW YORKER:Another Administration official said that, during the transfer of power, classified intelligence had shown multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russian representatives, but nothing that rose to the level of aiding or coordinating the interference with the election REALITY:Obama s team had much the same level of contacts In fact, his chief Russia hand, ùMcFaul, even visited Moscow during the 2008 transition to speak to Russian officials Was in October 2008, but yes, I did meet with Russian officials then (as I always had when visiting Moscow for previous 25 years)https:// t co /M4W1xUowvv And there was nothing wrong in what McFaul did For example, Bill Clinton spoint manon Russia and Eastern Europe was considered a source of intelligence information and classified as""a special unofficial contact""by SVR The man concerned, Strobe Talbot, correctlypointedout how it was an exaggeration of chats he had with the Russian ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov Additionally, Henry Kissinger has maintained intensive contacts with Moscow for decades Yet every recent American president has sought his advice And George W Bush s Russia expert, Elizabeth Jones, actuallygrew upin Moscow and attended local Russian schools NEW YORKER:Russian security concerns were hardly the only issue at stake with respect to the expansion of NATO; Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries in the region were now sovereign and wanted protection ¶ Putin, in his first few years in office, was relatively solicitous of the West He was the first foreign leader to call George W Bush after the destruction of the World Trade Center towers When he spoke at the Bundestag, later that month, he addressed its members in German, the language that he had spoken as a KGB agent in Dresden He even entertained the notion of Russian membership in NATO America s invasion of Iraq, which Putin opposed, marked a change in his thinking REALITY:Protection from what exactly? In the 1990 s, nobody was threatening anyone and Russia was both on its knees and desperately trying to join the Western fold, under the famously pro American Boris Yeltsin Indeed, as acknowledged by the magazine, during his early years in office, Putin continued the same posture, before becoming embittered by NATO expansion and the illegal Iraq War There have been countless academic articles, from genuine experts, backing up this view And even George Kennan, the most celebrated American Russia analyst of the twentieth century,agreed Thus, NATO s overreach eastwards has caused the exact problem that NATO purportedly exists to circumvent: insecurity in Europe In this sense, it was like employing a team of golden retrievers to clean up shredded canine hair Also, is it such a big surprise that the illegal invasion of a sovereign country, based on obviously false evidence, without a UN mandate, would affect the thinking of a government which regards its UN veto as an important defense tool? NEW YORKER:He (Putin) was alarmed by the Obama Administration s embrace of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt And he was infuriated by the US led assault on Muammar Qaddafi s regime REALITY:This is presented as something irrational, and comes without proper context However, given that Russia is home to around 20 million Muslims, and has a history of problems with Islamist terrorism, what s unusual about Putin being concerned about secular, stable (if obnoxious) regimes in the Middle East being replaced by (obviously even more obnoxious) radical Islamists? Also, he was infuriated about Qaddafi, because as mentioned earlier, the mandate the UN agreed to was for a no fly zone not a fully fledged NATO campaign of airstrikes, coordinated with the opposition POLL: Trump Administration More Trustworthy Than Media In fairness, not very hard to beat https:// t co /jmuciYXOPspic twitter com/vysRtei4xi NEW YORKER:Russian television, of course, covered the siege of Aleppo as an enlightened act of liberation, free of any brutality or abuses REALITY:Which is more or less exactly how American and British TV covered the liberation ù of Baghdad in 2003 Check out this extraordinaryreportfrom BBC s Andrew Marr Who later became the channel s political editor NEW YORKER:And yet Russian military planners and officials in the Kremlin regarded Georgia as a failure in the realm of international propaganda REALITY:It s not hard to see why Even to this day, US news outlets (and the aforementioned McFaul who definitely knows better) continue to insist that Russia attacked Georgia But in actual fact, the EU s independent investigation into the conflictruledthat Georgia started the war NEW YORKER:The United States, meanwhile, had its own notable cyberwar success In 2008, in tandem with Israeli intelligence, the US launched the first digital attack on another country s critical infrastructure, deploying a worm, ù known as Stuxnet, that was designed to cause centrifuges in Iran to spin out of control and thereby delay its nuclear development REALITY:This admitted act of aggression is given a sentence, but an incident in Estonia in 2007 (never proved to have been Russian state ordered) is highlighted over many paragraphs complete with quotes from the country s former President Toomas Ilves NEW YORKER:Obama s adviser Benjamin Rhodes said that Russia s aggressiveness had accelerated since the first demonstrations on Maidan Square, in Kiev When the history books are written, it will be said that a couple of weeks on the Maidan is where this went from being a Cold War style competition to a much bigger deal, ù he said Putin s unwillingness to abide by any norms began at that point It went from provocative to disrespectful of any international boundary ù REALITY:Even though they have 13,000 words to play with, our heroes never consider other aspects of Maidan Such as, was it normal for serving US and EU officials to turn up at the rallies and more or lessencourageprotestors to overthrow their democratically elected government? Indeed, it looked like the rock star style adulation went to their heads Furthermore, what authority did US official s Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt have tochoosethe subsequent regime in Kiev? NEW YORKER:Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany s foreign intelligence agency, has expressed concern that Russian hackers are also trying to disrupt the German political scene, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is standing for reelection as a stalwart supporter of NATO and the EU REALITY:German intelligence recently admitted that it foundno evidenceof Russian election hacking after insinuations of such activity was breathlessly carried by popular media last year Notably, the all clear ùgiven to Moscow was ignored by the same outlets Also, this whole premise is a bit illogical, seeing as the only realistic alternative to Merkel the SPD led by Martin Schultz is even more pro EU than her CDU party And Schultz himself has spent most of his adult life working in Brussels, home to both the EU and NATO NEW YORKER:While officials in the Obama Administration struggled with how to respond to the cyberattacks, it began to dawn on them that a torrent of fake news ù reports about Hillary Clinton was being generated in Russia and through social media REALITY:It s been proven the fake news ù was primarilygeneratedin America itself and inMacedonia Not Russia NEW YORKER:Russia s political hierarchy and official press greeted Trump s Inauguration with unreserved glee REALITY:Given Clinton s aggressive anti Russiarhetoric, during which she compared Putin to Adolf Hitler, why is this a surprise? Especially when Trump had spoken of trying to mend fences with Moscow?

"17 Jan, 2017",Lost legacy: How Barack Obama deliberately destroyed the US-Russia relationship,"Since becoming the US Commander in Chief in 2008, Barack Obama charted a thinly veiled anti Russia course that many failed to anticipate or appreciate due to the media generated hype of hope and change ù that accompanied his rise to power Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Few modern leaders have entered the world stage with more fanfare than Barack Hussein Obama After George W Bush s eight year War on Terror tour, many were ready to believe America s first black president would throw the US juggernaut into reverse Indeed, so mesmerized was the global village with Obama, who never brokered so much as a used car deal, itnominatedhim for a Nobel Peace Prize after less than two weeks in office To understand the source of our enchantment, we have to rewind to January 2007, shortly before Obama s meteoric rise: The relationship between the US and Russia had just entered severe turbulence as the Bush administration, top heavy with vicious neocons, announced it would drop a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe, with missile silos in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic The system, Washington explained, was to guard Europe from a rogue missile strike, ostensibly from Iran, despite the fact that such a reckless move on the part of Tehran would have meant quick US assisted suicide Moscow was not fooled This was made clear on February 12, 2007 when Vladimir Putin delivered his now famousspeechat the Munich Security Conference The Russian leader warned the stony faced delegates assembled there: Plans to expand certain elements of the anti missile defense system to Europe cannot help but disturb us Who needs the next step of what would be, in this case, an inevitable arms race? I deeply doubt that Europeans themselves do ù Putin went on to slam the American hyperpower ùand its well trained NATO attack dog for pursuing a world of one master, one sovereign ùthat will spark an inevitable arms race ù Putin s reality check came about three decades too late to break Europe s heavy American chains, thereby proving the Stockholm syndrome the curious psychological condition when hostages develop a helpless attachment to their captors can affect entire nations and even continents as well Suffice it to recall, later in Obama s presidency, Europe s muted reaction when an idealistic young American, Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor turned whistleblower, handed over thousands of classified documents detailing a USsurveillance programthat spanned the entire planet Even Angela Merkel s private cell phone was considered fair game Yet the astonishing revelations did little to dampen Europe s commitment to the Obama administration s policies But all that was in the future In the meantime, the world held its breath at the abyss, placing its faith in the hope and change ùsnake oil an Illinois Senator named Barack Obama was peddling via teleprompter to a war weary world that was increasingly willing to believe just about anything When Barack Obama emerged victorious in America s 2008 game of thrones, there was a promising break in the storm clouds Experts consulted their battered almanacs and predicted brighter days ahead in the US Russia relationship Unfortunately, the geopolitical weathermen got it wrong Tragically wrong And it all began with an innocuous sounding plan the US Russia reset ù rolled out by the seemingly well intentioned Obama administration In March 2009, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met in Geneva, where Clinton presented her counterpart with a cute reset ù button to signal in the much anticipated dawn in bilateral relations Although the largely symbolic gesture made for a great photo op, the reset moment was beset with glitches from the very start Much to the apparent embarrassment of the attendees, the US State Department had misspelled the word reset on the thingamajig in the Russian version; instead of reset ùit spelled ominously and even prophetically overload ù Lavrov and Clinton laughed off the technicality, cracked a few jokes, and pressed the plunger, thereby committing both sides to a tragic farce Lavrov could not have predicted such a backfire, however, since it was difficult to expect nothing less than miracles from the affable black guy from Hawaii who spoke so eloquently about ridding the planet of nuclear weapons, heralding in an age of world peace, and all that In any case, Moscow had no other choice but to believe him A few months later, when Obamaannouncedhe was going to shelve ùthe missile defense plans of his hawkish predecessor, it appeared the US leader was truly the real deal The belligerent Bush years, it now appeared, was nothing but an historic anomaly, a forlorn figure in the rear view mirror; America had conquered its aggressive neocon alter ego after all Those happy sentiments lasted for about as long as it took to read that line Yes, Obama would shelve ùBush s ambitious missile defense plans, but, with a sleight of hand and a lot of flip flop, the deceptive Democrat unveiled his own jazzy surround system the sea based Aegis SM 3 interceptors and forward based radar, which turned out to be surprise, surprise every bit as lethal as the Bush variant The Obama administration, however, apparently forgot that while the rest of the world played checkers, the Russians preferred chess Robert Gates, then defense minister, acknowledged as much when he noted, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles, ùthe Washington Postreported This admission blew the cover off of Obama s greatest deception, the US Russia reset hoax So now the question was no longer: Would the United States shelve the missile defense system? But rather: Would it cooperate with Russia on the system, thus sparing Eastern Europe another arms race? The answer to that question should have been obvious After months ofwild goose chasesaround negotiating tables, Moscow understood that the Obama administration was simply bluffing in order to buy time In November 2011, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced the formal end of missile defense talks (and the implicit beginning of an arms race) In fact, the Obama administration the very same nice people who introduced the reset idea refused to even provide written assurances that the system would not pose a threat to Russia s ballistic missile force, thereby upsetting the regional strategic apple cart via GIPHY Medvedev said Russia would, among other immediate errands,deployIskander missiles in Kaliningrad, equip Russia s strategic ballistic missiles with advanced warheads that are impervious to the missile defense system, and deploy offensive weapon systems able to take out any part of the US missile defense system in Europe ù If any of these moves on the part of Russia could be considered aggressive, ùWashington had nobody but itself to blame Yet, the US has talked up the mythical threat of Russian aggression ùamong its NATO client states to such a feverish pitch that these governments could not refute the groundless charges without appearing to be disloyal to Washington In other words, NATO members are not allies of the United States by mutual consent, but rather allies by arm twisting compulsion This brings us to the most dangerous part of the Obama administration s double dealing: Moscow itself is beginning to feel threatened by what it views and rightly, I believe to be American aggression on anabolic steroids Here is what Putin had to say about the US missile defense system, which has just gone live in Romania: They say [the missile systems] are part of their defense capability, and are not offensive, that these systems are aimed at protecting them from aggression It s not true, ùthe Russian leadersaid The great danger ùis that the launchers can be used to fire US Tomahawk missiles in a matter of hours, ùPutin said Meanwhile, technological advances will only make the system increasingly more versatile and powerful And exactly where the magic tipping point is, when the defense system shifts the global strategic balance, nobody can say with certainty Putin acknowledged this, saying technologies are developing, and we know around what year the Americans will get a new missile, which will have a range not of 500 kilometers, but 1,000, and then even more and from that moment they will start threatening our nuclear capability ù This deadly threat to Russia s national security a threat the United States would never accept if the situation were reversed naturally places those nations hosting the US missile defense system square in Russia s cross hairs It also makes it highly unlikely that Moscow will concede to further nuclear missile cuts Only a fool would take a dagger over a sword while his opponent reaches for a bigger shield Indeed, not only did the double dealing on the missile defense system trigger another arms race, it has threatened the New START Treaty a nuclear arms reduction agreement signed into force by Medvedev and Obama on April 8, 2010 in Prague Here is where the deceitful nature of Obama s reset is clearly revealed: At the very same time the United States was building for itself a mighty shield in Eastern Europe, capable of neutralizing Russian ballistic missiles, it was also working to have Russia dramatically reduce its nuclear sword through New START Obviously, the United States can t have it both ways, but that doesn t mean it won t stop trying It is interesting to note that US President elect Donald Trump has just suggested that he would consider the possibility of ending the sanctions regime against Russia in return for dramatically reducing ùnuclear weapons They have sanctions on Russia î let s see if we can make some good deals with Russia For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, ùTrumptoldThe Independent Trump may be many things, but a fool he is not So he must certainly understand that those weapons are Russia s only viable protection against the US missile defense, which, as we ve said, could turn offensive in a matter of minutes Moscow, it would appear, is hardly in a position to negotiate on these weapons The full implications of Barack Obama s pure deception over the missile defense system proved that the so called reset ù or overload ù had been nothing but a ploy, a smoke and mirrors diversionary tactic, in the hope of lulling Russia into believing that Washington was sincere about turning a new page in US Russia relations It was not A heavy footnote that needs mentioning is that the key architect of the US Russia reset was Michael McFaul, whose research, according to his ownwebpage, focused on Russian electoral trends, post communist regime change, and American foreign policy ù Little surprise, then, that Moscow expressed serious reservations when Obama broke with diplomatic protocol and named the non career academic the esteemed doctor of regime change, thank you very much as US Ambassador to Russia in January 2012 Now, Moscow is alleging US diplomats have engaged in espionage in Russia and actively participated in the rallies staged by Russian opposition forces, as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovrevealedthis week In addition to spying, US Embassy diplomats have repeatedly been seen taking part in the rallies of opposition, anti government forces, unauthorized rallies, including times when they wore disguise Do the math yourselves, ùLavrov stated #Lavrov: US has increased efforts to recruit Russian diplomats in recent years LIVE NOWhttps://t co/cOq6cPjwfBhttps://t co/SPlTpHqxKYpic twitter com/nJoM5XGpep Clearly, the reset was doomed to failure from the start, not because of any lack of will, but rather because the Obama administration was committed to it never succeeding in the first place Fast forward to 2016, and it is no coincidence that we see more than just the US missile defense system on Russia s border The New Year is barely underway and already we have dozens of US tanks, equipment and thousands of US soldiers fanning out across Poland and the Baltic States for what promises to be a continuous rotation of American military force exactly the sort of provocation US planners need to keep the entire region believing in the myth of Russian aggression ùand NATO members cracking open their wallets to buy up more US made military hardware So where is that promise of cooperation Barack Obama made to Russia when he first entered office? It s in that same state of limbo where other famous Obama promises like shuttering Guantanamo Bay detention facility and working to bring about global peace are located: neither here nor there A big part of the explanation is that the neocons are still calling the shots in Washington Meanwhile, the US mainstream media continues to serve up heavy helpings of fake news with regards to Russia, like thisopening linefrom The Spectator, which says it all: Is the Russian president really crazy enough to launch a new wave of invasions, or is it all a clever bluff? ù The intelligent, well informed reader would immediately ask: What Russian invasions? ùAfter all, the only time Russia initiated a military operation against a sovereign state was in August 2008 after Georgian forces invaded Tskhinval, the capital of South Ossetia, killing 12 Russian peacekeepers that had been stationed there Although the Western mediaabsolvedthen Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili of any wrongdoing at the time, an independent European investigation quietlyconcludeda year later that Georgia was indeed responsible for the instigating the five day conflict Who could have predicted eight years ago that Barack Obama, the peace president, would turn out to be many times more belligerent than the war president George W Bush? As Obama s final year winds down, some incredible statistics are beginning to emerge that show how militaristic the United States has become under Obama From Albania to Uruguay, Algeria to Uzbekistan, America s most elite forces Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets among them were deployed to 138 countries in 2016, ùaccordingto figures supplied to TomDispatch by US Special Operations Command That figure is a surge of 130 percent since the gung ho days of the Bush administration In the very same year, the Obama administrationdroppedan estimated 26,171 bombs, with most of them falling on the people of Syria and Iraq US bombs also hit targets in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan That s seven Muslim countries by the way Reset or not, there is no way Russia would have just sat back and watched as the Obama administration storm trooped its way through the Middle East and beyond Considering these truly disturbing figures, it is clear that the US military and its commander in chief was out of control, drunk on absolute power, and wreaking mayhem around a punch drunk planet for the past eight years The data also goes far at explaining Washington s marked hostility to Russian efforts to lend its military assistance in Syria against the terrorists of Islamic State Although it was largely due to Russia s air campaign that places like Aleppo and Palmyra were eventually liberated, today the Obama administration pretends Russia did nothing of significance in Syria On the weekend, Ash soon to be relieved of his imperial command Carter, US Defense Secretary, actually had the gall to say that Russia forces have achieved virtually nothing ùin Syria Nothing that could have been considered treacherous, he could have added The irony of the comment is so heavy it practically drips off the page: When Russia remained on the sidelines of the Ukrainian civil war, refusing to get involved in the affairs of its neighbor, it was falsely accused in Western media of actually invading that country On the other hand, when Russia was invited to enter the territory of Syria by its president to fight against Islamic State, which it did with stunning results, it was said by Washington to have contributed nothing ùto the Syrian efforts All things considered, the reasons are obvious why the US Russia reset never worked from the beginning It was predetermined to fail from the outset because America due to its supreme arrogance and exceptionalism believes it has no need of allies or partnerships That conceit is the fatal flaw of every dying empire",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/373950-obamas-legacy-reset-putin-russia/

dismissing the country as a regional power ù Now, you might think Ronald Reagan was pretty rude when he called the USSR an evil empire ù And it s doubtlessly true that many Russians and Ukrainians, Latvians and Georgians etc at the time were upset by the evil ù segment, but at least he balanced his insult by referring to Moscow s realm as an empire ù You see empires, no matter how nefarious, are strong, but regional powers ù are weak Thus, Obama using these two words was a colossal error of judgment Especially when you consider how he was taunting the only country on earth which is capable of inflicting real military damage on America For the record, headdedhow he perceived Russia to be acting not out of strength, but out of weakness ù Presumably, just to double down on the affront In the same way most Brits are proud of their Royal Family, the French are haughty about their food and Japanese puffed up by industrial might, Russians are appreciative of their country s power If Obama had received proper advice on how to handle Moscow he d never have made such a calamitous boo boo Especially when his statement was completely untrue, as subsequent Middle East events have demonstrated That said, however, the haplessperformanceof his former Ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, suggests he hired badly on the Russian front Now, with only a few months left in his Presidency, it appears Obama has finally given up on Moscow which seems to be an acceptance of how his Russia policy has gone up in smoke As a result, the outgoing President will almost certainly be handing his successor two completely unresolved conflicts as the aperitif for their time in office Those in Syria and Ukraine If Obama wanted to avoid this situation, and thereby achieve a more credible legacy, there are myriad things he could still do For instance, he might request a summit with Vladimir Putin to finally reach agreement on both matters And this, of course, is what previous occupants of the White House did when relations went sour Or he could even go further by calling full scale conferences on both, inviting all the stakeholders (although you d need an aircraft carrier to host all the contributors to the Syrian strife) But it appears Obama is too jaded to attempt to leave behind a clean record He d rather play golf and let poor John Kerry do all the donkey work Right now, relations between Moscow and Washington are at their lowest ebb since Konstantin Chernenko and Reagan occupied the two hot seats And it s worth noting how the former died in 1985 So, now that I ve highlighted the extent of the malaise, it s time to explain how bilateral engagement became so atrocious Obama evidently has an enormous ego And his arrogance toward Russia proves it He s assailed its economy, mocked Putin and completely refused to recognize Russian concerns in Eastern Europe Furthermore, he s even using Putin as a truncheon to batter Republican candidate DonaldTrumpin the current domestic election campaign This is bad diplomacy, at the very least Here s a sample Obamaquote: Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters ù This was in January 2015 and it s a new variant of a theme that s been doing the rounds since 1999 Back then Anders Aslund now a lobbyist at NATO s Atlantic Council adjunct predicted the country s imminent collapse in a Foreign Policy article which has become seminal As an example of how to be spectacularly wrong on Russia, that is Aslund, who gets away with his shtick to this day, is a prime example of somebody completely clueless on Russia who, bizarrely, is able to influence US policy makers And I reckon it s this sort of below par advice which explains why the Obama administration and the Bush government before it has been consistently wrong footed on the Russian question ù In Moscow, there are a number of theories doing the rounds to explain why Obama has apparently thrown in the towel Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov seems to believe the US President isnot fully in controlof his military and other elements in his government Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry s spokesperson, Maria Zakharovahas saidWashington † simply has no unified stance The reasons for this are maybe less complicated than they seem If it can be put remotely simply, both Washington and Moscow oppose ISIS However, America s allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ISIS s main supporters, which make things complicated The US views Islamist rebels (referred to as moderates in the Western media) as the country s future while Russia regards them as terrorists For its part, the White House believes the real aggressor is the Syrian government Which Russia contends is the only entity capable of keeping the state intact and defeating ISIS There are also myriad other vested interests to take into account, including Turkey, Iran, Israel, the Kurds and various others But let s not go there We also can t forget Ukraine, where things are a bit simpler Post Brexit and the Dutch referendum, there is no hope of Ukraine ever joining the EU Thus, aside from wanting the conflict contained, Germany, France and the UK have stepped back Even Sweden and Poland, who under previous regimes pushed for EU expansion eastwards, have disengaged As a result, it s now a straight conversation between Washington and Moscow The US desires a foothold in Kiev and Russia wants them out Obama s replacement will have to decide whether to up the ante or concede the issue It s also possible that internal Ukrainian concerns could intervene to change the dynamics After the State Department announced this week that it was suspending talks with Russia on Syria, the Kremlin saw the move and raised the stakes President Putin introduced a bill to the State Duma which proposes suspending a plutonium disposal agreement with the US, citing unfriendly actions ù by Washington In order to renew the deal, Moscow is seeking the cancellation of sanctions and the

"5 Jul, 2016",From Russia with Peace: Debunking the myth of ‚ÄòRussian aggression‚Äô,"Western pundits are busy peddling a new phenomenon they call Russian aggression , which they say represents a global threat of the first order Have the Russians become an aggressive race, or is this just a smokescreen to conceal the West s own behavior? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Having lived in Russia for nearly 20 years, I like to think I ve acquired some insight into the Russian mentality and how the Russian people generally react under different circumstances I can state with certainty that aggression is not an overriding feature of the Russian character In fact, quite the opposite is true Thus, it is with alarm that I read hysterical Western reports of Russian aggression claims that curl up and blow away under the slightest scrutiny Former US Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, for example, recentlypennedan opinion piece in the Washington Post [ How Brexit is a win for Putin ] where he discussed what the Brexit vote means for the EU Setting aside British opinion in the matter, he drags the phantom of Russian aggression into the discussion: Most importantly, one of the European Union s most principled critics of Russian aggression in Europe[that is, the United Kingdom]will no longer have a vote in Brussels The job of EU diplomats fighting to resist Russian aggression, especially those from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, just got harder ù Shorter Applebaum: it s always the Russianspic twitter com/XfqQ1L99Hj As par for course when it comes to reporting on Russia, concrete examples are rarely needed to support allegations and irrespective as to how outrageous those allegations may be Thus, McFaul never informs the reader as to how Russia has been behaving aggressively towards the Baltic States Apparently it is supposed to be accepted as an article of faith And for good reason To be forced to prove such a statement would be quite embarrassing since no such aggression exists Disagreementsyes, as is normal between neighbors that share a fence, but nothing that could be misconstrued as full blown, in your face military aggression Buried deep in the penultimate paragraph, McFaul distorts the historical record to conform with the narrative of Russia aggression a dark force that is personified by, wait for it: Putin is consolidating strength mobilizing popular support through foreign war He stopped NATO s expansion by invading Georgia in 2008 and slowed EU expansion by invading Ukraine in 2014 As a result of his military intervention in Syria, Putin is expanding Russia s presence in the Middle East, as Europe and the United States pull back ù Apparently the reader is expected to ignore, or fail to recall, that Darth Putin was not president at the time of the 2008 Georgian conflict And yes, Russia briefly invaded Georgia, ùbut only after Mikhail Saakashvili ordered a full scale, crack of dawn military attack against the breakaway region of South Ossetia, killing a dozen Russian peacekeepers in the process Oops It would have been more honest for McFaul to have mentioned Georgian aggression , at least in passing, since even the EUadmittedtiny Tbilisi was to blame for sparking the conflict Regarding the absurd and oft repeated claim that Russia invaded Ukraine, that bit of sensationalism can be duly refuted by a simple freedom of information request: Please provide one (1) satellite image that shows a single Russian vehicle/soldier/projectile crossing the Ukrainian Russian border at any time or place during said conflict The reason why it can t be produced is because Russia never invaded Ukraine And this is precisely how propaganda works: If a monstrous falsehood in this case Russian aggression is circulated enough times in the rusty public pipeline it magically takes on a life of its own, becoming an unchallenged, uncritical fact that only conspiracy theorists would be foolish enough to doubt A bit like the legendary alligator that lives deep underground in New York City s sewer system No wonder even the propagators of these Orwellian untruths eventually come to believe in the reality of their fantasy world At this point, so called Russian experts can toss around with gleeful abandon the warped idea of Russian aggression with little fear of being called out (except in the reader comments section, which many Western publications have tellingly axed altogether, thank you very much) It should be mentioned that passing off such easily debunked misinformation requires no small amount of contempt for the intelligence of your audience Claims of Russian aggression now represent a significant part of the Western media s information war against Russia It has become nearly impossible to peruse an article on Russia these days without being confronted with some variation of the theme This is a dramatic departure from the recent past, when US officials in an apparent effort to make Moscow acquiesce to Obama s missile defense plans for Eastern Europe unveiled in 2009 the laughable reset , complete with a red reset button that Sergey Lavrov and Hillary Clinton symbolicallypressedtogether in Geneva (US officials mistranslated the word reset as overloaded peregruzka which somehow sounds more accurate all things considered) When it became clear that the reset held as much power as a cereal box decoder ring, and the US had absolutely no intention of cooperating with Russia on missile defense, which they said was designed to protect Europe against rogue states , the US was forced to cover its tracks with a Russia bashing campaign that has now reached a crescendo As a result, aggressive Russia has shed whatever illusions it may have had about a US partnership, something which it truly desired Today, much of the delirious hyperbole against Russia is due to Moscow s ability to anticipate Washington s aggressive geopolitical designs, which ever since 2003 have been focused on regime change operations against unwilling patients across the Middle East, North Africa and in Ukraine For example, instead of Russia entering what would have been a disastrous military conflict in Ukraine, Moscow displayed commendable restraint, opting for nothing more than accepting Crimea into the fold after an overwhelming majority of the peninsula s population voted to leave Ukraine and join the Russian Federation Russia s next geopolitical move, which should have gained Washington s trust and friendship, was to conduct a full scale aerial campaign in Syria against Islamic State, which was somehow running an oil export operation in addition to its global terrorist campaign Yet the US inexplicably decried Russia s surprise move, refusing to share information with Moscow over ISIS locations †Go figure (Note: There is still hope for America, not to mention US Russia relations: Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, for example, proved his foreign policy savvy by applauding Putin s willingness to confront the new global baddies on the block) In my two decades of living and working in Russia, I have witnessed just a handful of physical altercations A pair of Russians at odds with each other will be content to spend their time hurling insults and arguments at each other long before the standoff disintegrates into a street brawl The only way I can explain this tendency to resolve issues without violence is that the Russians are extremely adept at their language a language that has produced some of the world s finest poetry and literature and relish an opportunity to demonstrate their proficiency at it Of course fights happen, but the threshold for spontaneous violence is much higher, I believe, than in the United States, for example, where a single insult can trigger a five alarm riot Can this national characteristic partially explain America s predilection for jumping headlong into military conflict? Instead of spending extra time in diplomatic negotiations that may defuse a dangerous standoff, the United States impetuously resorts to military action, which of course only exasperates the problem Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign adventure, the Russians hate and fear war, ùwrote agroup of Russian analystsliving in the United States Their conclusion should come as no surprise considering the massive toll Russia suffered from World War II It is no accident, I believe, that the Russian Federation is popularly portrayed by the bear, a large yet shy animal that goes out of its way to avoid contact and conflict, but one that will become extremely dangerous if unduly provoked And woe to the hapless hiker who happens to catch a female bear unawares while in the company of her cubs At that point, running, climbing a tree or both will do little to reduce the complexity of your situation Better to take your chances with fate and just play dead Similar to the aggressive bear who must suddenly contend with a group of hunters lurking in an adjacent tract of land, claims of Russian aggression are increasing in direct proportion to how close US led NATO forces approach Russia s western border In other words, Russia assuming a defensive posture as NATO carries out massive war games next door in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe is now arrogantly explained as aggressive behavior By way of comparison, please consider what Washington s reaction would be if Russia were to hold war games with South American countries in the Gulf of Mexico I think it would be a safe bet to say that US fighter jets, at the very least, would be buzzing those Russian ships Before the West s rhetoric concerning Russian aggression morphs into something altogether undesirable, the West should come to the realization that Russia more so than many other countries on the global stage possesses a natural ability to negotiate at length in order to defuse any global tensions Part of this willingness, I believe, derives from its historical appreciation of the spoken and written word, part comes from what amounts to pure intelligence, and part comes from the Russian peoples loathing of war, most notably due to World War II, which left an indelible impression on the Russian mentality Russia is only as aggressive as the Western imagination needs it to be",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/349569-russia-myth-peace-debunking-aggression/

proper diplomat He s careful with his words and favors quiet negotiation Kerry has also scored notable successes in Iran and with his assured handling of the Ebola scare In fact, the more we see of Kerry, the more we can lament his defeat to Bush in the 2004 US Election A campaign that failed, largely, because his foreign policy platform was too moderate for a country in the grip of tremendous martial zeal Indeed, pro military messaging here in Russia these days is relatively tame compared to the bombardment Americans endured in the mid 00 s A time when even popular rock bandswere booedat their own concerts for criticizingBush s aggression Obama s mistake with Russian policy was his naivety and lack of interest in a topic he probably considered irrelevant At least at first Like most his peers, Obama would have viewed tensions with Moscow as a relic of the Cold War When he appointed the hapless Michael McFaul as ambassador, he quite likely did so in good faith This guy speaks Russian and he s been interested in the region for a long time, ùwas probably the thinking While McFaul is probably not an ideological neocon, he had a history ofsupporting regime change ùmovements in the former Soviet space He d also been strong proponent of NATO expansion to Ukraine and Georgia As the Nation s Bob Dreyfusswarnedback in 2008: McFaul doesn t care about stability, since his main goal vis a vis Russia is to call attention to the autocratic nature of Putin s rule ù Obama s other mistake was to allow Hillary, as Secretary of State, to retain neocon holdovers from the Bush administration on her Eastern Europe team Even more incredibly, Kerry then inherited them for the second term Obama allowed US officials on the ground (in Ukraine and elsewhere) to pursue a grossly irresponsible and provocative anti Russian policy, ùAnatol Lieven recently told theValdai Club What on earth, one may ask, was Victoria Nuland, a neo conservative State Department official married to the arch neocon Robert Kagan, doing in the Obama administration at all, given that her attitudes run clearly counter to his? ù Lieven also pointed out that figures like Nuland are still favored by Hillary Clinton (Kagan is now moving into her political camp) and much of the US foreign and security establishment; and that with regard to Russia, that establishment is still conditioned to pursue what are in effect Cold War attitudes ù Right now, Hillary is the overwhelming favorite to become America snext President Bookmakers currently price her at 1/3, which implies a 75 percent chance that she ll be sitting in the Oval Office this time next year This is despite the fact that 55 percent of Americans hold a negative opinion of her,according to polls A Hillary Clinton presidency has the potential to bring East West dissonance to its lowest ebb since the Cuban Missile Crisis And that is not an exaggeration In 2014, she compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler Anyone with a smidgen of

expand operations against the terrorist group Syrian President Bashar Assad said the victory proves the success of the army s strategy in combating terrorism The liberation of the historic city of Palmyra today is an important achievement and another indication of the success of the strategy pursued by the Syrian army and its allies in the war against terrorism, he told a French delegation on Sunday, according to Syrian TV Our troops have established full control of the town and †are chasing the remainder of the retreating gangs of Islamic †State terrorists, the Syrian army s command said in a statement, as quoted by TASS A Syrian army officer told RT that preparation for the operation took a little over a month, and involved planned cooperation with the Russian military The primary goal was to carry out attacks to retake the heights and regions near Palmyra Yesterday (Saturday) we managed to seize the ancient Palmyra fortress Then the preparations to retake Palmyra city itself were carried out Daesh (IS) terrorists blew up the bridge leading to the fortress That s the reason why ground troops under the cover of artillery and tank fire entered the city from the north and freed these districts, ùthe officer said A commander of the Desert Falcons unit of the Syrian army †told RT that the military operation to †retake Palmyra lasted three days, adding that the main difficulty was that there were a lot of mines along the roads Today the Syrian Arab Army is clearing the mines, he said The army general command stated that Palmyra would now become a launchpad to expand military operations ùagainst the group in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, Reuters reported IS fighters have †reportedly retreated from Palmyra † located 215 kilometers (133 5 miles) from the Syrian capital Damascus †to the towns of Sukhnah, Raqqa, and Deir Ezzor In a statement read on Syrian television, the military command said the recapture of Palmyra marks the beginning of the collapse of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) It said the success proves that the Syrian government and its allies are the only forces capable of defeating terrorism in †the country The command went on to say that the army and its allies †will continue their campaign against IS, Al Nusra Front, and other terrorist groups ù On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Assad on retaking Palmyra from IS The two held a telephone conversation during which Putin stressed the importance of preserving the UNESCO World Heritage Site Putin added that Russia s forces will continue to help the Syrian authorities in their anti terrorist efforts, ùKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that over †80 militants were killed in Russian airstrikes which hit 117 terrorist military facilities in the Palmyra area Russian Air Forces carried out 40 sorties to Palmyra s area within 24 hours, ùthe Russian Center for Reconciliation in Syria said It added that eight command center buildings, 12 bases, two tanks, three artillery units, eight vehicles, and six ammunition warehouses were destroyed in the strikes It was previously reported that Syrian Army forces had advanced into the city on Saturday, with support from Russian airstrikes Television footage showed explosions taking place inside Palmyra, with smoke rising from buildings Tanks and armored vehicles fired from the outskirts of the city The recapture of Palmyra marks the biggest reversal for IS †since Russia s intervention into Syria The Desert Falcons commander thanked Russia †for the victory, noting that Moscow helped our country and our army against †Daesh (ISIS) and its supporters Noting the significance †of Palmyra, journalist Neil Clark told RT that having control of the city is incredibly important It s on the main highway, sort of equidistant between Damascus and Deir Ezzor the Syrian army has [now] †got a major boost in clearing IS out of a whole path of Syria, where [IS militants still are], he said That thought was echoed by political analyst †Talib Ibrahim, who told RT that the †location of Palmyra is key to other [areas] and that the †Syrian army can [now] go

 7, 2013 The typical US Ambassador doesn t get to be a hero like Pyatt 
 Instead, they essentially buy their sinecures Generally, the
 positions are a reward for fundraising or, very occasionally, are
 granted to a high profile individual with connections to the
 country An example here is when JFK s sister Jean Kennedy Smith
 enjoyed five years in Dublin, further strengthening the
 love love relationship between the Kennedy family and their
 ancestral homeland These days, the fastest way to become Your Excellency is by
 operating as a bundler A bundler is neither a type of
 wrapping, nor is it botany related; it s American terminology for
 an activist who pushes legal fundraising limits to their limits 
 Given the ridiculous expense of American democracy where
 Obama spent $1 1 billion on his 2008campaign these guys are invaluable Whereas
 a private citizen can only give $2,500 to a politician, a bundler
 collects contributions from dozens of different individuals and
 presents the sum in one payment Naturally then, in the spirit of Kris Kristofferson s famous
 observation that Nothin ain t worth nothin when it s
 free, they have to be rewarded once the candidate they
 backed secures the White House The easiest way is a comfortable
 ambassadorship, where the US taxpayer can keep them in style for
 a few years The most successful bundlers (bringing in $500,000+)
 even get to choose their location Sometimes these bundler nominees are hopelessly out of their
 depth TakeGeorge Tsunis, who was slated for the Norway
 job and immediately hoped to meet the President ù He was
 apparently unaware that the country is a Monarchy Then there sColleen Bell, a soap opera writer/producer,
 who couldn t answer John McCain s questions about America s strategic interests in Hungary ùTo be out maneuvered
 by the hapless Arizona Senator suggests a deep level of
 incompetence Also, don t forgetMax Baucuswho was appointed to Beijing after
 telling the Foreign Relations Committee: I m no real expert
 on China ùAt least he was honest This brings me to Andrew Schapiro The Ambassador to Prague was a
 year ahead of President Obama at Harvard Law School That said,
 Schapiro is somewhat different to most of Obama s motley crew He
 has family connections to the Czech Republic where his
 Prague born mother, Raya, was a Holocaust refugee His
 Grandmother and Uncle both stayed behind and died, both in
 Poland, one at Auschwitz and the other at Treblinka It s beyond any doubt that Schapiro would be fully aware that
 Russian led Soviet forces liberated those German death camps 
 Even if Treblinka had already been demolished by the Nazi s in a
 futile cover up attempt Ironically, the first Soviet officer to
 enter Auschwitz wasAnatoly Shapiro, a namesake The Ambassador s history makes his attempt to bully President
 Milos Zeman look even more ridiculous However, one thing
 Americans don t like is for their edicts to be ignored When you
 believe your nation to be indispensable ù how dare anybody
 question its orders? What s clear is that once Barack Obama announced that he would
 not be attending the 70th anniversary of Victory Day in Moscow,
 the State Department expected all allied countries to fall in
 line Other than Greece (which is in dispute with the EU) and
 Cyprus, everyone else has played ball except the Czechs Completely unqualified for his role, Schapiro weighed in and
 directly criticized Milos Zeman s choice to visit Moscow on May
 9 I can t even imagine the American reaction if the Czech
 ambassador took Obama to task for choosing to recognize Cuba or
 supporting an illegal coup in nearby Ukraine, to give two
 examples Once most Americans had figured out where the Czech
 Republic actually is, the Ambassador would be vilified I m in the U S for the holiday weekend I wake up, turn on

 5, 2015 Zeman claims that he s visiting Moscow to give thanks ùfor the fact that Czechs are not speaking German nowadays 
 Another unmentioned historical fact is that Czechoslovakia (as it
 was then) was effectively handed to Hitler by the free world in
 1938 Conversely, Soviet tanks rolled into Prague 30 years later
 to viciously quell an uprising Hence, Czechs have very
 ambivalent attitudes to both Russia and the Western powers Given
 their historical experiences, Czechs generally believe that they
 can trust neither side Their President has virulently opposed the veneration of Stepan
 Bandera by the post coup regime in Ukraine In January, he noted
 that Bandera had intended to establish a Nazi puppet state if
 Germany had succeeded in permanently removing Ukraine from the
 USSR Like his predecessor, Vaclav Klaus, Zeman has also beencriticalof American led sanctions against Russia Last week, Zeman attacked historical revisionists, pointing out
 that the USSR didn t annex Czechoslovakia after the war Soviet soldiers came in 1945 as liberators and by the autumn
 of that year had left our country, ùhe said In 1946,
 free elections took place which, unfortunately, were won by the
 Communist Party Schapiro claimed that Zeman s Moscow plans were short sighted as it would be awkward if the
 Czech President was the only statesman from an EU country on Red
 Square The bundler turned bungler is obviously unaware of the
 scheduled Greek and Cypriot attendance German chancellor Angela
 Merkel is expected to travel to Moscow the next day, May 10th Now that Zeman has barred Schapiro from Prague Castle, the
 residence of the Czech President, the next installment of this
 t√™te √† t√™te will be fascinating The President is certain to come
 under massive pressure from certain elements in his own
 government to backtrack However, with three years remaining of
 his five year term, he s unlikely to easily surrender For the US, we might have reached a fork in the road of its
 treatment of Eastern Europe I detect a feeling that support for
 American policy against Russia was taken for granted by
 Washington However, the Ukraine crisis has changed all that 
 While the Baltic nations will back US policy to the bitter end,
 for what they consider to be existential reasons, many Balkan and
 former Warsaw pact members are taking a different view With moribund economies or in Greece s case barely any economy at
 all; many are wondering if the zero sum game espoused by
 Washington and Brussels is really beneficial While most
 post communist EU states made rapid progress following their
 initial accession, improvements have almost completely stalled
 since 2008 Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have all
 expressed varying degrees of discomfort at the EU s Russia
 policy As have Greece and Cyprus which didn t endure communism 
 Additionally, Serbia and Turkey both EU candidates have both
 strongly opposed anti Russia sanctions Washington now has a clear choice Continue to bully Eastern
 Europe and risk watching support for the US crumble, or listen to
 the concerns of the region The problem is that this would
 involve admitting that American Ukraine policy has been
 boneheaded and that Russia has a key role to play in Eastern
 Europe They could start by appointing some real diplomats to the
 likes of Prague and Budapest, not Obama bagmen and women with a

 Council stresses the need to challenge Russia s ongoing
 disinformation campaigns and invites the High Representative to
 prepare by the June European Council an action plan on strategic
 communication in support of media freedom and EU values, the document said Lithuania is one of the champions of saving European souls from
 the increasingly popular Moscow viewpoint on the situation in the
 world But it seems like nobody in Europe is ready to pay for
 countering Russian media At least, Lithuanian Foreign Minister
 Linas Linkevicius has already declared that the United States and
 Europe must coordinate their actions in order to fight Russian
 propaganda efforts and provide alternative sources of information
 for Russian speakers Interestingly, but providing
 alternative sources of information for Russians in the
 Baltics, ùis what Moscow has been persuading them to do for
 the last 20 years Now, that Russia has successfully done it at
 its own expense time has come for Western bureaucrats to make
 some money by becoming part of the process What they are trying to prove to taxpayers is that if they do not
 coordinate the actions by strengthening alternatives to the
 Russian media, they will not win the fight What kind of fight
 are we talking about? Probably, the fight for government funding?
 The US Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has announced its
 2016 budget request The agency, responsible for American
 overseas news and information programs (including on Voice of
 America and Radio Free Europe), is seeking $751 5 million to
 increase global engagement, move more aggressively into
 television and digital media, andsupporthigh priority audiences ù A statement by the BBG Chairman reads: Our goal is to help
 US international media nimbly respond at a time of pressing
 national security challenges as well as dramatic shifts in the
 way people around the world engage with media As authoritarian
 governments tighten their grip on media and extremist groups
 exploit it to sow hatred and fear, our role is to engage
 audiences and bring a trusted voice to those who need it
 most ù Did it ever occur to BBG and their sponsors in Washington DC,
 that the only reason an increasing number of people in Europe and
 the US are tuning in to sources like RT and Sputnik is because
 they want to see the other side of the story, to hear other
 people, than the usual network flock of experts , continuously
 proposing their audience a choice of 50 shades of gray? The reason for the increasing success of RT is that we are not
 fighting a war, not even competing with media monsters like CNN,
 BBC, BBG, but simply satisfying the need of their own audiences
 for an alternative view of world events As simple as that Both
 in Europe and in the USA there are people who rightly feel that
 their voice is not heard We listen to them; we discuss their
 views and let them share it with others And this straightforward
 approach is the competitive advantage of Russian media over the
 Western mainstream compare it to Soviet era propaganda, the difference is
 that modern Russian channels resonate with people s feelings and
 emotions, which makes Moscow s messages today more successful I
 doubt that can be countered by mere funding With declining value
 of the ruble, RT s 2015 budget is rapidly shrinking towards a
 $200mn mark, compared to BBG s $700mn plus, the BBC World
 Service s 245 million ($362 million) and Al Jazerra s reported
 $1 2 billion So, if it s really going to be a war, which I hope
 we still can avoid, it will not be a war of money Not even a war
 of words, but a war of ideas This is a battle the United States
 won in 1776, Israel back in 1948, and which Russia is winning
 today For this sole reason President Obama hasnamedRussia one of the main threats to US
 domination, along with ISIS and Ebola And this is probably what
 made BBG s Andrew Lack compare RT to a terrorist organization: he
 hopes that will win him the money Such shameful statements from
 a person in his position may still make his sponsors disregard
 the fact that Mr Lack is planning to spend $12 5 million
 proposed in FY 2016 to support open and free Internet Last time
 I came across free Internet was in Starbucks, but I m not sure
 Mr Lack is going to share any of his $12 5 million with the
 Seattleites Likewise, I doubt that American money will open the
 Web for the Chinese population Lack of common sense is the only
 condition under which Mr Lack may get to spend a dozen million
 on his internet anti censorship programs But not if his enemy is a Russian terrorist organization, like
 RT! It may sound absolutely absurd but it is quite understandable
 look at the other instances where people and organizations
 that are committed to investigative journalism have been treated 
 For example WikiLeaks, a publishing organization, has been called
 a terrorist organization by US officials, and let s not forget
 that many US journalists have been under threat of being taken to
 court with references to similar legal mechanisms So we are
 seeing a danger in the Western world, where those in power are
 ready to use terrorism laws to silence journalists and media
 organizations According to Dr Oleg Matveyev, former analyst with Vladimir
 Putin s presidential administration, to stage reforms in US
 government media, is mere boondoggle because lately their level
 has seriously degraded These information resources worked pretty
 well earlier, in Soviet times, when they were presenting more
 alternative points of view Today they are nothing more than a
 red rag to a bull, and not even that, since the Kremlin no longer
 considers them to be enemy voices Despite active
 jamming, an estimated 42 million Soviet people regularly listened
 to the Voice of America and the BBC because of the
 small credibility of Soviet propaganda Today their audience
 narrowed greatly due to the variety of opinionated Russian press American radio stations may be more popular in some post Soviet
 countries, where the problem with freedom of press is more acute
 than in Russia There they can pose a serious alternative to
 local sources of information And I should admit that Michael
 McFaul s Twitter was one of the most popular internet resources
 in the Russian segment of the worldwide web when he was posted as
 the US ambassador to Moscow Please note, His Excellency didn t
 charge extra for this activity! He just had a message for the
 Russians, which Obama has not But the diplomat also had a message
 for the White House about how the American media dealing with
 Russia should be reformed But this Obama totally ignored,
 preferring to focus on a much easier task of staging a revolution
 in Kiev, which now became a never ending headache for himself,
 and his opposite numbers in Europe, let alone the Ukrainians
 themselves, who are killing each other by the thousands ever
 since the cash flow from the United States started A Gallup poll last month said Americans don t look for an
 alternative to the US mass media preferred slants on Russia This
 result is greatly influenced by many Americans relying too much
 on US mass media, while not actively pursuing other news sources 
 People with a secondary interest on a given subject are more
 likely to rely on mass media, as opposed to doing further
 research A number of key American TV providers in major US
 markets don t carry RT, unlike other foreign news networks,
 including Al Jazeera, Arise, NHK, CCTV and the BBC How come this fact is used for justification of additional
 multi million dollar spending on another media standoff?

"3 Mar, 2015",US ignores Russia‚Äôs offers of talks ‚Äì Duma foreign relations chief,"There is no contact between the Russian and US parliaments as the Congress has repeatedly ignored all initiatives of negotiators aimed at settling various international crises, a senior Russian MP stated in an interview Currently there are no contacts whatsoever between the State
 Duma and the US Congress, but this is not our fault, ù head
 of the State Duma Committee for International Relations Aleksey
 Pushkov told Izvestia daily He noted that it all started in 2013 when leaders of the State
 Duma proposed that a delegation of MPs to Congress in order to
 discuss the crisis in Syria and possible ways to overcome it At
 first, the US lawmakers agreed to this, but then replied with a
 refusal, Pushkov said Pushkov added that he personally had sent a message to his US
 colleagues via former US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul,
 asking for a meeting on neutral ground, such as Vienna or Geneva,
 but received no answer at all Any dialogue can be built on participation of two parties
 and we cannot impose it on the US if they think that it is not
 worth the effort Since then there have been no relations between
 us, ù he observed in the interview Pushkov noted that in his view over the past few years the United
 States were engulfed in anti Russian sentiments Political scientists who arrive from Washington observe that
 never before, not even in the height of the Cold War years, not
 even under President Reagan, have they witnessed such
 anti Russian hysteria and so much anti Russian propaganda, ù
 Pushkov stated He then suggested that this phenomenon is
 connected with the change in objectives pursued by the US
 authorities if during the Cold War they sought to defeat the
 USSR in foreign policy, now they want to overthrow Russia s
 domestic regime In such circumstances I see no positive signals for
 inter parliamentary dialogue with the United States, even though
 we do not dodge contacts with some of the congressmen, ù he
 said When reporters asked Pushkov if he thought the US had already
 prepared a scenario for a color revolution in Russia, the Duma
 official answered that this was possible, adding that there could
 be several such scenarios Earlier they had plans of the Russian Maidan set on the
 Bolotnaya Square, ù Pushkov noted [Bolotnaya Square is a
 large site near the Kremlin that witnessed violent clashes
 between protesters and police during a mass rally in 2012 which
 led to a high profile trial and about two dozen convictions] 
 The US authorities considered the participants of these
 events as a long term movement that required political and
 informational support Today they maintain close contacts with the radical
 pro American opposition represented by Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
 Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Kasyanov Of course, these people s
 political chances are miniscule, but this is the best the US
 could get ù The third scenario, according to Pushkov, is consistent economic
 pressure on Russia in hope that it would cause a fall in living
 standards and provoke mass protests that would question Putin s
 authority These scenarios exist, but the question remains if they are
 feasible, ù the MP concluded ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/237165-russia-america-talks-pushkov/

 deluded In a globalised world, what initially appears like a
 local problem can quickly become a much wider contagion Pre crisis, Russia s economy was somewhere around 4% of global
 GDP and whole sectors, particularly in Europe, are reliant on
 exports to it Furthermore, the fiscal health of central Asian
 states is worryingly beholden to their giant neighbor If Moscow
 is catching a cold, Yerevan and Astana are in danger of

 China won t be getting off scot free either As economist Dr Constantin Gurdgiev of Trinity College, Dublin
 puts it, Russian imports of goods and services are likely to
 contract by between 12 and 15 percent in 2015, with much of this
 effect being driven by a decline in capital goods and consumer
 goods imported traditionally from Europe In addition, financial
 exposures to Russia run high in Austria, Italy, France and the
 UK While the European banks have seen some strengthening of
 their balance sheets in recent months, another adverse shock to
 their assets is not something they would like to
 contemplate ù If Russia opts for capital controls and/or imposes a holiday

 facts statement by the US State Department press secretary that
 in contrast to the behavior of the Russians, the American side
 treats diplomats from Russia with the utmost respect, ùthe
 Russian Foreign Ministrystatementreads In a report Monday, ABC News accused Russia of Cold War style
 harassment of US embassy diplomats, which included slashing,
 hacking and breaking into diplomatic apartments Reporting on the issue at length, the ABC s Kirit Radia listed a
 number of cases when US officials none of whom were named 
 were targeted by Russia s aggressive, Soviet era
 counterintelligence tactics ùof intimidation and harassment that is believed to be led by Russia s Federal Security
 Services (FSB), a successor to the Soviet KGB ù The report specifically focused on Michael McFaul who served as
 the US ambassador until last February and who also was
 targeted by aggressive actions ù The Office of Inspector General described McFaul s treatment as a level of petty and more serious harassment far exceeding
 that experienced by his predecessors McFaul himself refused to speak to ABC We are not supporters of public discussions of professional
 sides of the diplomatic work and risks associated with it, which
 are especially high in the US given the scale and range of secret
 operations by American intelligence, closely watching over

 we have something to say, ùthe statement added According to the ministry, Russian diplomats in Washington have
 been purposefully ùspied on and attempts have been made
 to entrap them in conversation Employees of the Russian center for science and culture in
 Washington, DC, have also faced targeted persecution by the US
 side We can recall the incident that took place not so long ago
 when force was used not only against the staff of our embassy in
 the United States, but also their wives, who were subjected to
 detention and harsh interrogation in handcuffs, ùthe
 statement said The American side offered no apologies
 despite our requests ù Russian diplomats reported regular recruiting attempts, when rough provocative techniques ùwere used or personal
 data, including on health status of family members, illegally
 obtained Speaking of US diplomats working in Russia, the Ministry stressed
 that are they are not an example of law and compliance with
 the provisions of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
 relations ù According to the ministry, US envoys have been involved in about
 20 cases of traffic violations This also includes the accident
 when a US diplomat smashed into cars parked in the street on last

"15 Jun, 2014",Catch me a spy: Secret Snowden rendition plot revealed?,"A US government jet used in CIA rendition flights flew into Europe on the same day NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong, the UK Register reports The plane was one component in a concerted US effort to nab the rogue leaker Amateur plane watchers first caught a glimpse of an unmarked
 Gulfstream V business jet flying above Scotland at 45,000 feet on
 the morning of June 25, 2013 The tail number N977GA has been
 associated with previous CIA rendition flights While the
 aircraft was allegedly not reporting its progress to air traffic
 controllers and had not filed a flight plan, the enthusiasts were
 able to track the plane s radar transponder signal using a
 technique calledmultilateration The plane showed up on our system at 05:20 on 25 June, a member of an internet aircraft tracking network run by
 enthusiasts in the UK toldthe Register We knew the reputation of
 this aircraft and what it had done in the past According to online tracking information collected by the
 enthusiasts, the plane never made it to Moscow, but instead
 landed at Copenhagen Airport, where it stayed put Snowden, incidentally, arrived in Moscow on the evening of June
 24 from Hong Kong, where he had intended to catch a connecting
 flight to Cuba His passport was voided, leaving him effectively
 stranded in Moscow s Sheremetyevo Airport In August, Russia
 granted him asylum for one year The N977GA has a checkered past, with Dave Willis writing in 2008
 for Air Forces Monthly that the plane has been used in the CIA s program of extraordinary rendition against terrorist
 subjects ù On October 5, 2012, together with a privately owned Dassault
 Falcon 900 the two planes reportedly carried terror suspects Abu
 Hamza, Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al Fawwaz and Adel Abdul
 Bary to the United States to face trial after losing an
 extradition battle in the UK Meanwhile, the FBI, the CIA, the State Department and other
 government agencies were meeting on a near daily basis to
 determine a way to apprehend Snowden, according to a recent
 report in theWashington Post The meetings, convened by White House homeland security adviser
 Lisa Monaco, included among its participants the CIA s head of
 counterintelligence, FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce, and former
 US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who often took part by
 videoconference in meetings which often began well after midnight
 in Moscow But despite their best efforts, they often ran into a brick wall,
 namely Russia Snowden has not committed any crimes on Russian
 territory, an official told Interfax at the time In
 addition, Russian law enforcement agencies have received no
 instructions through Interpol to detain him So we have no
 grounds to detain this transit passenger That sentiment was later reflected by Russian President Vladimir
 Putin, who said Russia was not protecting Edward Snowden, ù but
 had no legal basis to extradite him We can t say for sure whether or not Mr Snowden committed a
 crime in the US, it s impossible for us to ascertain But as a
 sovereign country that has no extradition treaty with the US,
 Russia has no other choice but to permit him to live here, ùPutin said In lieu of a Russian handover, US officials hoped Snowden would
 attempt to flee to a third country, with the hopes of nabbing him
 in route The best play for us is him landing in a third
 country, ùMonaco said, according to an official who met with
 her at the White House We were hoping he was going to be
 stupid enough to get on some kind of airplane, and then have an
 ally say, You re in our airspace Land, ùthe official
 added It was this hope which led to a serious diplomatic breach of
 etiquette, when the presidential plane of Bolivian leader Evo
 Morales was forced to make a sudden stop in Vienna, after Spain,
 France, Portugal and Italy abruptly blocked their airspace to
 him Austrian authorities searched Morales plane, which had
 departed from Moscow, hoping to find Snowden on board Morales accused Washington at the time of masterminding the plot,
 saying the incident reflected a neo colonial ù attitude to his
 entire continent Just days after Snowden had arrived in Moscow and nearly a week
 before Morales plane was grounded, US President Barack Obama
 struck a dismissive attitude towards the whistleblower, saying he
 was not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29 year old
 hacker ù Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council,
 later clarified Obama s remarks to the Post, saying the US would
 not use military assets to capture Snowden, who has been charged

"26 Mar, 2014",‚Äã‚ÄòRussia is enemy of the Western global financial system‚Äô,"Barack Obama is effectively a tool of the collapsing Western financial system, that has declared war on Russia and its allies, Lawrence Freeman from Executive Intelligence Review Magazine told RT, adding that Ukraine crisis was arranged to weaken Russia RT:The US President said that we re not
 facing a new Cold War yet He has also called on Russia to be
 deeply isolated how do these points come together, how do they
 even work side by side? Lawrence Freeman:First of all you should not
 believe what President Obama says We are in a very dangerous
 situation that could escalate to a world war The decisions that
 President Obama s made are not his own He is a effectively a
 tool of Wall Street and the British financial system, and they
 have declared war on Russia and President Putin because of the
 leadership role that Russia plays in the whole Eurasian
 continent, which is moving in a different direction The financial system of the Western countries is in a full state
 of collapse and that is what is driving this President and the
 Europeans to this escalating war against Russia and also China 
 So I wouldn t believe President Obama because he actually is not
 that intelligent, and not his own person RT:When condemning Russia s reunification
 with Crimea, Obama said that all comparisons with Kosovo are
 irrelevant He said: We did not annex Iraq s territory We did
 not grab its resources for our own gain Instead we ended our war
 and left Iraq to its people in a fully sovereign Iraqi state that
 can make decisions about its own future ù It sounds like he is
 saying he knew his actions there were more understandable than
 Russia s actions in Crimea because Washington never annexed
 Iraq What do you make of those parallels? LF:Again, we know what the real truth of the
 matter is The US government, President Obama, using people from
 the Cheney administration of Cheney and Bush organized a coup
 in Kiev Victoria Nuland, who used to work for Cheney, has been
 organizing, she said, for several years to overthrow the
 government We worked with well known neo nazis and right wing
 fascists to illegally overthrow the government in late February 
 And this was done to try and provoke President Putin in Russia
 into a response And Russians responded by allowing the people of Crimea to rejoin
 Russia, which they have a great long heritage to So who is
 responsible for the situation in Ukraine? It s the deliberate
 policy of the US and the Western under this financial system to
 try to weaken Russia, as an effort to weaken Eurasian Russian
 policies for economic development RT:Obama stressed neither US nor Europe are
 interested in controlling Ukraine Do you find this
 believable? LF:Of course not We wanted to use Ukraine,
 which is a very large country with a long border with Russia We
 want to weaken Russia Because, look what Russia is doing
 with China, with India, with other countries they are moving
 forward in terms of economic development, space technology,
 energy development, infrastructure The West right now is going through the most severe financial
 economic collapse in its history In Europe and now in the United
 States, our food supply is dwindling, our energy supplies are not
 there, we have no forward progressive development And so the
 Western financial powers are using Obama and intended to use
 Ukraine to weaken Russia And that is why we went for this overthrow of government in Kiev 
 And this is blatantly clear And Victoria Nuland who is a
 leftover from the Cheney administration made it clear publicly 
 She picked a new government and said that we spent 20 years and
 $5 billion building up the so called pro democracy forces in
 Ukraine to overthrow the government And they hoped that they can
 go from there to actually overthrowing the Russian government,
 which the former US ambassador McFaul stated quite clearly, that
 that is the intention that he had when he was the ambassador, as
 part of this project democracy networks was to bring in a new
 government and a new regime into Russia So there is no truth to what Obama is saying and you do not
 forget you get into war, a world war usually by mistakes and
 miscalculations, not by what people say but what they intend to
 do And Russia and China are an enemy of the Western global
 financial system right now ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/russia-us-financial-system-473/

 the offense, which caused casualties and mass destruction in the
 Balkan republic Codenamed Operation Allied Force, it was the largest attack
 ever undertaken by the alliance It was also the first time that
 NATO used military force without the approval of the UN Security
 Council and against a sovereign nation that did not pose a real
 threat to any member of the alliance NATO demonstrated in 1999 that it can do whatever it wants under
 the guise of humanitarian intervention, ù war on
 terror, ù or preventive war ù something that
 everyone has witnessed in subsequent years in different parts of
 the globe Nineteen NATO member states participated to some degree in the
 military campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
 (Serbia and Montenegro), which lasted for 11 weeks until June 10,
 1999 In the course of the campaign, NATO launched 2,300 missiles at
 990 targets and dropped 14,000 bombs, including depleted uranium
 bombs and cluster munitions (unexploded cluster bombs continued
 to pose a threat to people long after the campaign was over )
 Over 2,000 civilians were killed, including 88 children, and
 thousands more were injured Over 200,000 ethnic Serbs were
 forced to leave their homeland in Kosovo In what the alliance described as collateral damage, ù its
 airstrikes destroyed more than 300 schools, libraries, and over
 20 hospitals At least 40,000 homes were either completely
 eliminated or damaged and about 90 historic and architectural
 monuments were ruined That is not to mention the long term harm
 caused to the region s ecology and, therefore, people s health,
 as well as the billion dollar economic damage News correspondents Anissa Naouai and Jelena Milincic, the

 hit and set on fire by NATO airstrikes on May 7, 1999 Three
 citizens of the country were killed The alliance called the
 attack a mistake ù China is a permanent member of the
 UN Security Council and, along with Russia, did not support a
 military solution for the Kosovo crisis Prior to the military assault, the Milosevic regime was accused
 of excessive and disproportionate use of force in
 Kosovo ù But was the force that NATO used when bombing the
 sovereign state s territory proportionate and restrained? Rights
 organization Amnesty International accused the allied forces of
 committing war crimes Indications are that NATO did not always meet its legal
 obligations in selecting targets and in choosing means and
 methods of attack, On the basis of available evidence, including
 NATO s own statements and accounts of specific incidents, Amnesty
 International believes that whatever their intentions NATO
 forces did commit serious violations of the laws of war leading
 in a number of cases to the unlawful killings of civilians, ù
 the rights watchdog said in areportpublished in June 2000 The alliance dismissed the accusations, saying that cases
 involving civilian deaths were due to technological failure or
 were simply accidents of conflict ù NATO failed to say that they
 were due to the alliance s own failure to take all necessary
 precautions We never said we would avoid casualties It would be
 foolhardy to say that, as no military operation in history has
 been perfect, ù said Jamie Shea, NATO s chief spokesman, the
 Guardian reported at the time Former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered military
 action against Yugoslavia following a failure in negotiations on
 the Kosovo crisis in France s Rambouillet and Paris in February

 international mediators known as the Contact Group the
 Yugoslav government, and the delegation of Kosovo Albanians ended
 in a deadlock Belgrade refused to allow foreign military
 presence on its territory while Albanians accepted the proposal Back then, Slobodan Milosevic s forces were engaged in armed
 conflict with an Albanian rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army
 (KLA), which sought the province s separation from Yugoslavia 
 Former US President Bill Clinton s special envoy to the Balkans,
 Robert Gelbard, had earlier described the KLA as without any
 questions, a terrorist group ù (The KLA was later repeatedly
 accused of being involved in the organ trafficking of Serbs in
 the late 1990s ) However, despite not announcing the link officially, NATO entered
 the conflict on the side of the KLA, accusing Serbian security
 forces of atrocities and ethnic cleansing ù against
 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo The main objective of the campaign
 was to make Milosevic s forces pull out of the province The fact
 that there was violence on both sides of the confrontation was
 ignored both by allied governments and Western media which
 stirred up public anger by focusing only on Serbs atrocities and
 being far less vocal regarding abuses by Albanians All efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to
 the Kosovo crisis having failed, no alternative is open but to
 take military action, ù Solana said on March 23, 1999 
 We must halt the violence and bring an end to the
 humanitarian catastrophe now unfolding in Kosovo ù An incident involving the mass killing ù of Albanians in
 central Kosovo s village of Racak a KLA stronghold became a
 major excuse and justification for NATO s decision to start its
 operation Serbs were blamed for the deaths of dozens of Albanian civilians ùon January 15, 1999 However, it was alleged
 that the accusations could have been false and the bodies
 actually belonged to KLA insurgents whose clothes had been
 changed A central role in labeling the events in Racak a
 massacre ù belonged to William Walker, who headed the OSCE
 Kosovo Verification Mission He visited the site shortly after
 the incident and made his judgment [Walker] arrived there having no powers to make conclusions
 regarding what had happened, ùRussian Foreign Minister
 Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazenta paper
 in November last year Yugoslav authorities accused Walker of going beyond his mission
 and proclaimed him persona non grata, while Western leaders were
 infuriated over the Racak incident And some time later the bombing started, ù Lavrov
 recalled, adding that the situation in Racak became the trigger point ùMoscow insisted that an investigation
 should be carried out The EU commissioned a group of Finnish
 forensic experts to prepare a report on the incident Later, the
 European Union handed it over to the International Criminal
 Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Lavrov said The full version
 of the document has never been made public, said the minister,
 who was Moscow s permanent representative to the UN between 1994
 and 2004 But parts of the report leaked and were quoted in the media
 saying that [the victims] were not civilians and that all the
 bodies found in Racak were in disguise and that bullet holes on
 clothes and bodies did not match There was also no one who was
 killed at short range, ù Lavrovsaid Even though I ve repeatedly raised this
 issue, the report itself still has not been shown ù NATO halted its air campaign with the signing of the Military
 Technical Agreement in Kumanovo on June 9, 1999, with the
 Yugoslav government agreeing to withdraw its forces from Kosovo 
 On June 10, 1999, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1244
 to establish the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
 (UNMIK) In August 2013, Amnesty Internationalaccusedthe UNMIK of failing to properly
 investigate the abductions and murders of Kosovo Serbs in the
 aftermath of the 1998 1999 war Years have passed and the fate of the majority of the

 the legitimacy of the new leadership in Kiev and also investigate
 its alleged crimes Do you think any of that will actually
 happen? Daniel McAdams:Well, I m pretty skeptical about
 these kinds of investigations, but the core disagreement between
 the US, the EU and Russia is really very simple was the
 government installed after the coup legal, or is it not? And is
 Yanukovich legally, according to Ukrainian constitution still the
 president? So everything else I think is sort of window dressing 
 The two sides fundamentally disagree on this I think there is a quite easy solution to this problem, which is
 probably, not that I m in the business of giving advice, but go
 back to the 21 February agreement where you will have an
 extremely weak president in power He will have some sort of a
 technical government taking over until the elections can be
 organized It is a face saving measure for the US The Russians
 don t get everything that they want The problem can be solved,
 but it will take some sacrifice, some listening and some
 consideration that the coup is not legitimate RT:And the things have moved on now rapidly
 with this upcoming referendum in Crimea on Sunday Why are the
 Western governments so opposed to its bid for independence? DM:Well you know it is funny, former ambassador
 to Moscow Michal McFaul has been twitting away about Crimea is
 not Kosovo, Crimea is not Kosovo! ù Madeline Albright, former
 secretary of state has chimed in as well It is kind of interesting to see the people who supported the
 lawless coup in the streets of Kiev, now all of the sudden being
 the strongest stringers for every fine point in the Ukrainian
 constitution You know it is quite funny The point of the matter
 is that there are differences and there are similarities RT:Alright, what are the parallels then? Do
 you think the Crimeans do have the right to draw a parallel to
 what happened in Kosovo? DM:Well the point to be made is the double
 standards of the US and the hypocrisy of the US The US has been
 endlessly going on about the will of the Albanian people in
 Kosovo, how they have the right to express their view and their
 will and have their own future And now that the shoe is on the other foot, the place that they
 don t want to break away, they are saying something very, very
 different Which is that they don t have the right to do the same
 thing So the hypocrisy is more important, than whether or not
 they have the right to do this RT:If the vote does go ahead, and the
 Crimeans vote for independence, the G7 says they will not
 recognize this bid for independence What actually could these
 countries do about it? DM:Well are they going to isolate, are they
 going to sanction a major world power, in particularly when you
 have both China and India recently expressing support for the
 Russian position? It is absurd This is not Syria, this is not
 Cuba that you are going to embargo In any case sanctions are an
 act of war And it is a ridiculous move for the US and EU to
 face Even the referendum is not necessary go back to the

 do that? I doubt it ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/west-sanctions-russia-absurd-446/
"11 Mar, 2014",US uses law on aid to post-coup governments as ‚Äòpolitical football‚Äô,"The US has double standards when it comes to suspending aid to countries where the authorities have been overthrown by force, Egypt and Ukraine are a clear example, Jeffrey Steinberg, Executive Intelligence Review senior editor, told RT RT:Ukraine s deposed leader claims
 Washington is breaking its own laws when offering money to the
 current authorities in Kiev So does Yanukovich have a point
 here?Jeffrey Steinberg:I think he absolutely has a
 point he s correct that under US law, all US aid must be
 suspended if a legitimately elected government has been
 overthrown by military force or other kinds of coup activity 
 This is not some esoteric issue; it s come up in two recent
 instances Number one in Egypt last summer when the military
 stepped in and deposed the Morsi government after tens of
 millions of people turned out in the street, there was a
 ferocious debate in the Obama administration and in the Congress
 over whether it was to be technically labeled a coup, and
 ironically, under that debate, Senator John McCain was one of the
 leading voices arguing for a total cutoff of all military aid to
 Egypt So now he is on the exact opposite side of the same
 debate So clearly this law is being used as a political football It s
 applied in instances where it suits the policies of the
 administration and certain hardline allies in congress and it s
 freely ignored when it s an inconvenient truth And here in the
 case of Ukraine, nobody can dispute the fact that number one, the
 Yanukovich government was legitimately elected, and number two
 that it was overthrown by military force involving the most
 severe right wing neo Nazi and neo fascist elements who were in
 the Maidan and who in fact rejected the agreement that was signed
 by Yanukovich, the three opposition parties, and the foreign
 ministers of Germany, France and Poland, with a Russian observer
 present just days before the coup So I really think it is a case
 where Yanukovich has some very legitimate points to be raised,
 and I understand he intends to bring this before the US courts
 and before the US congress RT:A dozen US fighter jets and hundreds of
 personnel are off to Ukraine s borders A Pentagon spokesman says
 quote what we are doing is reassuring our allies that we are
 there for them ù Where s this heading, do you think?JS:Well, it s directed against Russia 
 President Obama has had kind of a personal obsession with
 President Putin since the beginning of his presidency; it s one
 of the reasons he sent Michael McFaul as a kind of provocation,
 in your face against the Russian government, and I think that
 we ve got to be very blunt here that when you have NATO and
 American military forces right up against the borders of Russia
 at the same time that the US is deploying missile defense into
 Romania, missile defense systems are now actively present in
 western Europe aboard the Arleigh Burke destroyers in Rota,
 Spain, that this is not just a danger of a limited confrontation,
 but this is a danger of a war that could escalate into a general
 war, and even a thermonuclear war confrontation Many American analysts Lyndon LaRouche, the founder of my
 publication, Paul Craig Roberts, a number of others, have said
 that this administration in Washington, in backing an illegal US
 and European funded coup in Ukraine, is running the risk in
 greatly escalating the danger of a military confrontation that

"3 Mar, 2014",Anti-Russian rants are just PR ahead of EU parliamentary poll ‚Äì Russian officials,"The various anti Russian statements voiced by EU officials should be taken with a grain of salt as they are just attempting to lure voters ahead of the May poll, and are not interested in Ukraine actually joining the EU, a senior Russian senator holds All this hysteria in the European Union are nothing more
 than a PR bubble created in the lead up to European Parliamentary
 elections on May 25, ù Andrey Klimov, a deputy head of the
 Federation Council s committee for international relations, told
 Russian mass circulation daily Izvestia All forecasts say that its next composition will have a lot
 of Euroskeptics and the current commissioners headed by President
 Jose Manuel Barroso will have to resign For this reason their
 current statements should be divided by at least two people
 often lie during election campaigns, ù Klimov said The comment was made ahead of the urgent meeting of foreign
 ministers of the EU countries dedicated to the current situation
 in Ukraine and the possible measures against Russia that had
 already announced its readiness to protect its citizens, ethnic
 Russians and Russian speakers caught in the Ukrainian turmoil Other European reaction to the Russian political support of the
 Eastern regions of Ukraine ranged from statements of concern to
 recalling of ambassadors from Russia to a request for an
 extraordinary session of the NATO council Klimov noted that it was very unlikely that EU officials would
 continue the current course of supporting the Maidan 
 authorities in Kiev after the May elections are over according
 to the Russian senator, the realists among European politicians
 understand very well that the European economy cannot afford
 another hanger on The senator also commented on the threats of economic sanctions
 against Russia made by US officials and politicians, such as
 former Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul Klimov noted that the
 current trade turnover between the US and Russia is far from
 anything serious and such sanctions on the part of the US would
 not do Russia any sufficient harm On the other hand, the mutual dependence between Russia and
 European Union is very strong and there is no common position
 among EU members on the current crisis, the politician added 
 This means that the European countries can soon start separate
 talks with Russia, Klimov concluded In the current situation I would recommend that Brussels and
 Washington introduce sanctions against each other The US must
 answer for instigating a civil war and adding to the explosive
 situation in Europe A number of EU countries should be made
 responsible for opening the Pandora s box by violating the
 February 21 agreement of Ukrainian stabilization, ù he noted Many top level Russian politicians observed in public addresses
 that no one in Russia was interested in war with its neighbor 
 Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said during a Sunday
 televised panel discussion that Russian diplomats strongly
 opposed the unfounded accusations of war mongering We will support all forces that favor the strengthening of
 bilateral relations between our countries, especially now when
 the European stability depends on these relations Western
 politicians who are currently cursing us must understand
 this, ù Karasin stated In the same program the head of the Russian upper house,
 Valentina Matvienko, reiterated her position that only Ukrainian
 people can decide who will run their state and this decision must
 be made through an honest, clear, transparent and lawful
 elections The head of Russian senate also supported the idea of
 rendering financial and humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people The chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs, Leonid
 Slutsky, said that all Russia had done in Crimea was defend sites
 belonging to its Navy, but it can also extend this protection to
 everyone who asks for this as this is a noble thing to do The Russian upper house has approved Vladimir Putin s request to
 sanction the military involvement in the standoff between
 pro Russian population of the Eastern regions of Ukraine and the
 new authorities in Kiev However, Putin not only has not given
 orders to the troops, but according to presidential spokesman
 Dmitry Peskov, has not yet taken the decision that such
 involvement was necessary On Sunday Vladimir Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela
 Merkel and the two leaders agreed to immediately establish a
 commission of enquiry as well as a contact group, possibly under
 the direction of the Organization for Security and Co operation

 poet, Aleksander Pushkin The blog states that McFaul s 7 month
 separation with his family is no longer endurable The
 ambassador s wife and two sons moved back to the United States
 from Moscow in last summer because one of their children wanted
 to finish school at home The whole family agreed that this was
 the right decision, the post reads The news of Ambassador McFaul s possible resignation first
 appeared in November 2013 The Russian mass circulation daily,
 Izvestia, wrote at the time that the diplomatic failures
 demonstrated during the Snowden scandal, the adoption of the Dima
 Yakovlev law and the earlier row over the Magnitsky Act, could
 cost the diplomat his career McFaul s own announcement of his departure, on the contrary,
 concentrated on successes, such as the reset ù in Russia US
 relations, the successful cooperation on Afghanistan and many
 other problems He also mentioned the unresolved issues, but said
 that he was nevertheless satisfied with the way the US side had
 worked on these McFaul s style of addressing the mass media and people through
 blogs and social networks became his trademark he was the first
 US ambassador to Russia to adopt the new media This openness allowed for direct contact with Russians (at least
 one way) but also led to numerous misunderstandings and sometimes
 conflicts The contradictions became especially acute as Russia
 moved to ban the adoption of Russian kids by US citizens, and by
 proxy of US organizations When the bill was in its preparatory stage, the Lower House of
 the Russian Parliament invited Ambassador McFaul to the hearings
 concerning the fate of some Russian kids adopted by US parents 
 The diplomat officially turned down the invitation, saying that
 it was not established practice for a US diplomat to testify
 before foreign parliamentary bodies The day after refusing the invitation from the State Duma, McFaul
 published an extensive letter in Russian and English in his
 internet blog He said that he was deeply concerned by the way
 some Russian commentators were portraying the US legal system, US
 diplomats and Americans in general Russian legislators expressed surprise at this statement and
 noted that the rules had not prevented McFaul from discussing the
 cancellation of the Jackson Vanik amendment in the Upper House of
 parliament several months before The head of the State Duma
 international relations committee, Aleksey Pushkov, called
 McFaul s refusal a regrettable fact, but noted that it only
 showed that the United States was not ready for serious dialogue Another recent Russian novelty the law that requires all NGOs
 engaged in political activities and receiving sponsorship from
 abroad to register as foreign agents also became a conflict
 point between McFaul and the Russians In November 2013, the
 ambassador said at a public press conference that he was outraged
 by mass media allegations that the US government was sponsoring
 the Russian opposition McFaul also dismissed the reports of his
 alleged connections with popular anti corruption blogger, Aleksey
 Navalny, and assured the Russian public that he had never given
 Navalny any money When Navalny was running for Moscow mayor in August 2013, McFaul
 again mentioned the blogger in a Facebook post The diplomat
 posted a photograph with one of Aleksey Navalny s campaign
 posters with life size photographs of male and female supporters 
 The male figure had McFaul s face, either glued on the spot or
 Photoshopped The ambassador wrote that he received the picture
 from someone ù via twitter and the mysterious person
 asked him if the image was altered artificially Of course
 it is! ù the diplomat said But the mere fact that
 someone is asking such a question is depressing Tragic that
 someone could even think for a moment that this photo is
 real, ù McFaul elaborated before asking his Facebook friends
 to explain the situation The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to McFaul s announcement in

"19 Dec, 2013",Putin says he will pardon jailed oil tycoon Khodorkovsky shortly,"Vladimir Putin will sign a pardon for jailed ex Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky in the nearest time, ù the Russian president announced following a large media conference in Moscow He has spent over ten years in confinement which is a
 serious term, I believe, ù Putin told journalists on Thursday
 after a four hour Q&A session with national and foreign
 media In the pardon plea that Khodorkovsky has written just
 recently, ù he referred to humanitarian
 circumstances, ù the president said His mother is ill 
 And I think that a decision can be made and the decree on the
 pardon will be signed in the nearest time ù Under Russian law, convicts are entitled to seek a pardon, Putin
 said However, Khodorkovsky did not do so until recently, when an
 appeal was finally submitted, he said The comment was made after the annual press conference with over
 1,300 journalists present Just as the president was preparing to
 leave the conference hall, one of reporters asked him about
 Khodorkovsky Earlier in the press conference, Putin was asked about the
 possibility of a third criminal case being brought against the
 former Yukos CEO The president said he did not want to comment
 as he had nothing to do with it He added, though, that he saw no
 feasibility in a third case going forward Khodorkovsky s mother, Marina, told RT that she last spoke with
 her son through a glass wall ù back in August, when she
 came to see him in jail So, we don t know about his reaction [to the news], ù
 she said [Prisoners] are allowed to make phone calls once a
 week, on Saturdays So, I can t learn about his response before
 Saturday ù She said Putin s decision came as a surprise to her It was a bolt from the blue for me, because I was totally
 unaware about [the request for pardon], ù Khodorkovskaya
 said I don t know if he asked for a pardon I know
 absolutely nothing about that ù Answering RT s question about whether Putin s decision was partly
 linked to the state of her health, Marina said: I would like
 to believe that he still has some humane feelings ù Meanwhile, Khodorkovsky s lawyer Vadim Klyuvgant told the RAPSI
 news agency that he did not apply [for a pardon] and we have
 no information that anyone has applied on his behalf
 recently ù He added: We don t have such information, even though pardon
 pleas have regularly been submitted by various persons ù
 during all the years of Khodorkovsky s confinement Later in the
 day, the legal team departed for an urgent meeting with their
 client Until the lawyers meet with@Khodorkovsky, all their
 previous statements regarding him asking for a pardon should be
 considered invalid î khodorkovsky (@khodorkovsky)December
 19, 2013 Putin s press secretary Dmitry Peskov, however, said the letter
 Putin has recently received was signed by Mikhail Khodorkovsky
 personally By filing a request for a pardon, Khodorkovsky is
 admitting his guilt, Peskov also said A petition for a pardon has been submitted to the president 
 If he asks for a pardon, it means he admits his guilt, ù
 Putin s press secretary declared Not everyone viewed the move as such Pavel Krasheninnikov,
 chairman of State Duma s Legislation Committee, argues that
 admitting one s guilt is not a condition required by the law The Constitution provides for a right to file a request for
 a pardon There is no requirement for admitting guilt in this
 case, ù he told Interfax John McCain was also surprised by the news of a pardon for
 Khodorkovsky after a decade of political imprisonment ùwhich the US Senator believes has become symbolic of
 Russia s culture of corruption, impunity, and injustice under
 President Putin ù Pavel Khodorkovsky, the son of the former oligarch, called it very happy news saying that he can t wait to see his
 dad Michael McFaul, the US Ambassador to the Russia
 congratulated Pavel, in his twitter reply Congratulations Pavel RT@pmhburyatia@niktwickVery happy news

 made a good decision ùand expressed hope that
 Khodorkovsky would be free as soon as possible ù Formerly Russia s richest man and head of major oil firm Yukos,
 Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 and later sentenced to nine
 years in prison on embezzlement and tax evasion charges In 2010, Khodorkovsky s prison term was prolonged after he was
 found guilty of large scale theft of oil and money laundering in
 a separate case The former tycoon s 11 year jail term officially
 expires in August 2014 Putin opponents believe that Khodorkovsky became the victim of a
 campaign to punish him for perceived political challenges to the
 incumbent president The news on the pardon prospects has immediately gone viral
 across the media, with rights activists particularly welcoming
 Putin s move I m really happy that this painful and tragic saga is
 nearing its end I m grateful to everyone who has contributed to

"28 Nov, 2013",CNN cuts ‚Äòmost crucial points‚Äô from interview with Russia's UN envoy on Syria,"CNN has made significant cuts to its interview with the Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, most notably his comments on the number of people that actually support Syrian President Bashar Assad [UPDATE:In the wake of the media stir, CNNpublisheda full transcript of the interview on its website 
 In response to a request from RT, the broadcaster issued this
 statement: The Amanpour team conducted a lengthy interview, making it
 clear that it was taped and would be cut down for length and time
 on air This is normal practice for taped interviews We never do
 anything to an interview that would alter its meaning ù] Questions considered by Russia to be of key importance to the
 ongoing conflict in Syria were absent from the Tuesday nightshowwith Christiane Amanpour The first concerned Assad s role in the interim period, which the
 Russian envoy said should be up to the people and no one else Churkin calls attention to the fact of life that many
 Syrians, a large segment of the Syrian population, are supporting
 President Assad, [which] has to be taken into account ù So let s have the dialogue started and let s allow the
 Syrians to decide what kind of path they need to take to end this
 conflict, the envoy stressed The uneditedversionof Churkin s words appears on the website of
 Russia s permanent mission to the UN Another topic, which CNN felt was unnecessary in the final
 version of the Amanpour show, was to do with the rebels role in
 the conflict The envoy said that any conditions they might have
 for joining the upcoming Geneva talks should be put aside in
 favor of the bigger picture which is getting to the
 table Despite the apparent differences in how Russia and Western powers
 view resolution of the Syrian crisis, the necessity of the
 upcoming January 22, 2014 event is something both agree on and
 have worked hard to promote, albeit with emphasis on different
 things The repeatedly delayed peace talks will bring together Syrian
 President Bashar Assad s government and the opposition for the
 first time since the bloody conflict began in March of 2011 Despite their confirmed participation, the warring sides likewise
 see the talks going in two completely different directions The
 rebels see the event as a platform for the removal of Assad from
 power, as its specific aim; while Assad has stated that he has no
 intention of leaving office, but has repeatedly voiced his
 support for a bloodless, diplomatic solution The country s
 Foreign Ministry has said that its representatives will be going
 to Geneva not to hand over power to anyone, but to meet with
 those who support a political solution for Syria s
 future, ùAP quoted the statement as saying on Wednesday Another of Churkin s comments cut by the Amanpour show about the
 rebels concerned the concerted efforts on their part to hamper
 humanitarian aid delivery to the war stricken population Churkin made it clear that the latter is being done by the
 insurgents in agreement with their foreign sponsors Drawing a comparison between the warring sides, Churkin said that
 achieving progress on the humanitarian front is much easier where
 Damascus is concerned, but this was not the case with the rebels,
 because nobody knows who is influencing those hundreds, or
 dozens at least, of armed groups on the ground, ùthe envoy
 explained We need to identify those countries and they need to assume
 responsibility for dealing with those groups so that they will
 not prevent the evacuation of the population from besieged
 areas, Churkin added, alluding to the problem of the
 evacuation of IDPs (internally displaced persons) from volatile
 areas Because over the past few months, ùhe went on, there
 have been a number of situations when the Syrian government
 agreed to the evacuation of the population, but the opposition
 groups prevented that from happening And finally, Russia s UN envoy touched on a point that he
 believes has received little to no coverage in Western media, and
 that is the evidence that unambiguously points to the rebels 
 apparent disinterest in alleviating the suffering of the people
 whose wellbeing they claim to care for: Whenever the population is leaving various besieged areas
 they move to the territories controlled by the Syrian government,
 it says a lot about whom the population is relying on for
 providing humanitarian support Speaking to ITAR TASS, Russia s UN representative expressed
 regret that the complete interview did not make the CNN cut and
 censored the most crucial issues to the resolution of the
 Syrian crisis Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said that the fact that CNN has cut some crucial points on Syria from
 the Churkin interview goes way beyond the bounds of
 professionalism, or even understanding such moves by Western
 media aimed at removing bits and pieces of information it deems
 unnecessary ù to its viewers broader understanding, are becoming
 the rule and not the exception especially where Russian
 officials are concerned ù Any attempts by CNN to justify and explain their actions, for
 instance by limited on air time or irrelevance of edited pieces,
 are baseless, Zakharova said I don t know whether the US Ambassador to the Russian
 Federation, Michael McFaul, who has so many times criticized
 Russian media outlets, will comment on this situation with the
 American channel, but I know that Vitaly Churkin is a
 professional, is perfectly fluent in English and is a welcomed
 guest at all the world s media, Zakharova said ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/churkin-interview-cnn-amanpour-446/

"31 Aug, 2013",Syria says it's ready for attack 'at any moment',"The Syrian government says it s expecting a military attack and is ready to retaliate at any moment, according to a security official who wished to remain anonymous The US holds Syria accountable for using banned chemical weapons and threatens payback Follow RT s LIVE UPDATES on Syria chemical
 weapons crisis We are expecting an attack at any moment We are ready to
 retaliate at any moment, the security official in Damascus
 told AFP The Syrian Prime Minister also stated readiness for any possible
 foreign strikes against it, saying that: The Syrian army is
 fully ready, its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or
 scenario that they want to carry out, ùin a written statement
 which was broadcast on television This comes as the UN chemical inspection team finished its work
 in the Arab country and headed to the Hague with samples taken at
 the sites of alleged chemical attacks Earlier, UN
 Secretary General Ban Ki moon said it may be two weeks before for
 final results of their analysis are ready The US, which has been mulling a military strike on Syria, said
 they would not attack while the UN team was still in the country 
 Following State Secretary John Kerry s Friday Speech, French
 President Francois Hollande however declared that a strike could
 come by September 4 US intelligence agencies claim that a chemical weapons attack
 near Damascus on August 21 killed a total of 1,429 Syrian
 civilians, including 426 children The intelligence gathered for
 the report, revealed Friday, allegedly featured an intercepted
 communication by a senior Syrian government official familiar
 with the attack as well as other human, signals and satellite
 intelligence The report stated that President Bashar
 Assad s † was allegedly responsible for the attack President
 Barack Obama used the data to make the case for retaliation
 against the Syrian government On Saturday, Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, declared that
 the idea that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons on
 its own people was utter nonsense Calling the attack a
 provocation by Middle East forces seeking to get the US
 involved, he urged Washington to present its evidence to the UN
 Security Council At a meeting on the same day between Russian Deputy Foreign
 Minister Sergey Ryabkov and US Ambassador in Russia Michael
 McFaul, it was emphasized that the report by the working
 group of international experts in Syria shall be subject to
 consideration by the Security Council, Russia s Foreign
 Ministry said Russia also clearly stated that any military action against
 Syria by the US, bypassing the UN Security Council, would be an
 act of aggression and a flagrant violation of international
 law Russia and China have vetoed three resolutions that would
 increase pressure on Bashar Assad since the start of the war
 conflict in spring 2011 They are also against a current proposal
 by the US, the UK and France (the three Western permanent members
 of the Security Council) for a resolution that would allow
 military action against Syria over a chemical weapons attack
 which the West blames on the regime, and the government blames on
 the rebels Earlier this week German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized
 Russia and China over their stance in the Syrian crisis It is very regrettable that Russia and China have refused for
 some time to come to a common position [with Western partners] on
 the Syrian conflict This considerably weakens the role of the
 United Nations, Merkel said in an interview with German
 newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine, published Saturday Merkel ruled out German participation in any military action
 without international approval Germany cannot participate in any military intervention
 without a mandate from the United Nations, NATO or the EU, 
 added Merkel, who is seeking re election as chancellor for a
 third consecutive term in late September A poll published Thursday showed German public opinion against
 military action by the West in Syria, with about three fifths
 opposed to any potential strikes, and only about one third in
 favor of military intervention Another poll showed that most French people do not want France to
 take part in military action on Syria, either, and that most do
 not trust French President Francois Hollande to do so A BVA poll
 released by Le Parisien Aujourd hui en France, showed that 64
 percent of respondents opposed military action, 58 percent did
 not trust Hollande to conduct it, and 35 percent feared it could
 set the entire region [Middle East] ablaze The French president said that Britain s parliamentary vote,
 which rejected a motion authorizing military action in Syria on
 Thursday, would not affect France s own actions, however Hollande, whose popularity has been affected by the economic
 slowdown, showed unexpected military vigor when he dispatched
 troops to help Mali s government fend off Islamist rebels earlier
 this year in Africa, an intervention then backed by two thirds of
 the French public On Thursday, British lawmakers voted against military
 intervention in Syria by a 285 to 272 margin, rejecting the
 government s motion to support military action against Syria in
 principle The motion came after Cameron made his case in favor
 of missile strikes and many in Parliament cast doubt on his
 assertions It is clear to me the British Parliament,
 reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see
 British military action, Prime Minister David Cameron said 
 I get that and the government will act accordingly ù ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/syria-expects-military-attack-250/
"14 Aug, 2013",US ambassador puzzled after finding his image on Navalny campaign poster,"The US Ambassador to Russia has discovered his photo on a stand used by supporters of opposition blogger Aleksey Navalny, who is currently running in the Moscow mayoral race Michael McFaul announced the news on his Facebook page and posted
 a photograph with one of Aleksey Navalny s campaign posters with
 life size photographs of male and female supporters The male
 figure had McFaul s face, either glued on the spot or
 photoshopped The ambassador wrote that he received the picture from
 someone ù via twitter and the mysterious person asked him
 if the image was altered artificially Of course it is! ù,
 the diplomat said But the mere fact that someone is asking
 such a question is depressing Tragic that someone could even
 think for a moment that this photo is real, ù McFaul
 elaborated before asking his Facebook friends to explain the
 situation Facebook users suggestions ranged from mere hooliganism and
 idiocy ù to a deliberate anti Navalny campaign launched by
 the bloggers competitors However, the author of the latter
 theory did not explain why the alleged slanderers sent the image
 to McFaul instead of spreading it among the public The situation with the ambassador was not the only scandal that
 developed around the mayoral campaign and candidate Aleksey
 Navalny this week Late on Tuesday, city police reported that
 they seized about two tons of illegal propaganda ù from an
 apartment in the city center that they called Navalny s electoral
 headquarters The operation was prompted by a complaint filed by an anonymous
 citizen, but when police arrived at the scene another mayoral
 candidate Nikolai Levichev of the Fair Russia party also
 arrived with a team of supporters and a group of journalists For
 several hours people from Navalny s team remained behind the
 locked metal door and demanded that policemen produced a search
 warrant Eventually law enforcers said that the neighbors noticed
 smoke emerging from the apartment, removed the door with a
 circular saw and got in All the campaign materials were seized and four people who were
 in the apartment and unwilling to confirm their identities were
 briefly detained They now face charges of refusing to comply
 with a police officer s orders (an administrative offence with a
 maximum punishment of 15 days in jail) On Wednesday afternoon the Moscow police press service explained
 that they did not need a warrant to enter the apartment as it was
 being rented and the landlady had given prior authorization to
 enter the premises after officers contacted her and described the
 situation The woman herself confirmed this in an interview with Izvestia
 daily Also in the afternoon a Moscow court imposed a 1000 rouble (about
 $30) fine on each of two of the detained activists for hindering
 law enforcers work One more supporter of Navalny was sentenced
 to 10 days of administrative arrest One of the reporters who was covering the events from the
 stairwell said that he was physically attacked by a man from
 Levichev s team, while Fair Russia insisted that the journalist
 himself attempted to start the fight So far the mutual
 accusations have not sparked any criminal proceedings Navalny s official elections HQ said that the detained activists
 were acting on their own initiative and did not coordinate their
 work with Navalny or his representatives They, however, noted
 that the actions of the would be promoters were absolutely legal The Moscow Election Commission, on the other hand, has said that
 the discovered materials had been made with violations Part of
 it, for example, did not bear labels identifying the organization
 that had commissioned the printing The rest of the content was
 marked as Navalny s official materials, although their quantity
 was larger than officially reported To this, the head of Navalny s HQ Leonid Volkov noted that the
 slogan on the stickers in question ( Do not lie and do not
 steal ù) bore no particular names and therefore cannot be
 considered campaign materials at all Moscow mayoral elections are set for September 8 According to
 the latest opinion polls, Navalny, who is running for the liberal
 pro market bloc SPS PARNAS, can claim support from about 15
 percent of the electorate Only 0 5 percent of Moscow residents said they were going to vote
 for Nikolai Levichev, who is running on the ticket of the
 center left Fair Russia party Incumbent acting mayor Sergey Sobyanin, running as independent
 but backed by parliamentary majority United Russia leads the
 polls with over 74 percent of potential voters ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/macfaul-navalny-russian-poster-482/

Is the Russian Reset dead?Today we discuss the fallout from the Snowden case with Stephen Cohen, Professor of Russian Studies and History at New York University and Princeton University Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie
Shevardnadze: At this point, to whom is
Snowden more of a problem the US or Russia? Steven
Cohen:From my perspective, he is a
problem for both If we put this in historical context since the end
of the Soviet Union 22 years ago, we ve lost several opportunities
to create a meaning for cooperative relationships between Washington
and Moscow It appeared a few weeks ago that we had another
opportunity The opportunity began with a tragedy the bombings in
Boston It was later clear that there was a need for a lot of
cooperation in counter terrorism between Moscow and Washington And
then, the Syrian civil war, whatever it is, ran out of control 
it s certainly the worst crisis in the Middle East for many years 
It also appeared that Washington and Moscow were ready to do
something about it And then came Snowden Not only Snowden, but he
is clearly a setback I would say both for President Putin and
President Obama Sophie
Shevardnadze:But you say that Putin is
handling the Snowden situation wisely Steven
Cohen:What makes us really interested
is that President Putin is the man that likes to control the
environment in which he makes international and I suppose domestic
 decisions He couldn t control this Snowden came literally out
of the blue and he hadn t decided what to do So he was caught and
he remains caught between two strong countervailing factors: On the
one hand, Putin pursues in a world which I would call not an
ANTI American foreign policy, but an UN American foreign policy or a
NON American foreign policy That is, a foreign policy rather
different from the US in many areas Therefore, he could not turn in
Snowden a highly symbolic figure over to the US On the other
hand, it s absolutely clear that Putin wants some kind of
cooperative relationship with the US I think he has probably done as
good as he can do As in, the solution is to allow Snowden to remain
in Russia in some status of temporary asylum, while he sorts out how
he s going to go to a third country Venezuela or some other
place That s a legal issue He needs travel documents, and he
probably has to go to the embassy of that country in Moscow But
although it s legal, it s profoundly political In a way,
Russian American relationships hinge on that at the moment And as I
said the other day to an American who asked me, this tests the
leadership ability not only of Putin, but of Obama, to solve this
problem Sophie
Shevardnadze: You ve brought up an
interesting point saying that Putin likes to control the
situation Do you think he would have acted differently if he wasn t
confronted with the sheer fact of Snowden being in Russia? Steven
Cohen:I mean, all leaders real
leaders, state leaders try to control the environment in which they
make decisions Very often, they can t Wars come, acts of
terrorism come, and leaders change in other countries with which they
were doing business What we don t know about Snowden affair is
whether or not the Chinese, when they allowed Snowden to fly to
Moscow from Hong Kong, cleared it with the Russian end Whether the
Russians said, Okay, send him along ù If that happened and we
don t know, but I would guess it did because the Chinese Russian
relationship is very important and very close at the moment I would
assume that whoever in Moscow made that decision it might not have
been President Putin; he can t make every decision before it
becomes a crisis they may have assumed that in fact Snowden was
going to do as Snowden was going to do spend maybe ten hours in
the transit section of Sheremetyevo airport and then get on a plane
to Havana, and onwards, as he thought, to Ecuador And then, a
problem rose with Ecuador and he is still in Moscow So in that
sense, we don t know if Putin said Ok, travel through Moscow, ù
not knowing he was going to become a kind of resident in Moscow We
just don t know that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Another problem is that
his passport was cancelled so he couldn t really fly through Moscow
even if he wanted to But given the way things are right now, what
does Russia risk if it grants Snowden official refugee status? Steven
Cohen:As you know, there is a very
strong anti Kremlin, anti Putin, anti Russian lobby in Washington 
Its citadel is the US Congress That s why we get preposterous
legislation like the Magnitsky act Congress is prepared to do
anything to strike at Russia Yesterday, for example, one of the
senators proposed that the US boycott the Winter Olympics in Russia
in 2014 that won t happen but the mere fact that the US
senator, who is supposed to be a person of wisdom and dignity, would
propose such a preposterous thing shows you what kind of Congress we
are dealing with I predict and I think any idiot could predict 
that when, and I assume it s when ù Snowden gets his temporary
asylum in Moscow, the members of Congress, members of the various
anti Russian lobbies like Freedom House in the US, and many others
will denounce the Kremlin and demand that Obama does something very
bad to Russia And then Obama will be tested we will see if he
can withstand that or not That s why I say by the way, that I
think it s is a kind of test not only of the wisdom and the
leadership of Putin but the wisdom and the leadership of Obama Let
me remind you, Obama didn t ask for this Snowden crisis Putin
didn t ask for it They just got it Sophie
Shevardnadze:The media right now is
more focused on Snowden s personal life what he eats, what he
wears, where he lives, where his girlfriend is than his
revelations and the leaks Can we expect the attention to turn back
to the NSA and PRISM, or is that issue now buried under the Snowden
narrative? Steven
Cohen:You raised what for me is the
fundamental question: What should we, the Americans, be doing now?
Ever since Snowden made these revelations, there s been a big open,
public debate about whether or not we approve of these massive,
intrusive surveillance programs by American intelligence agencies 
And of course, Europe and Russia and other countries who had been
survellied have to make that decision too But first and foremost,
this is the question for Americans: Is it compatible with our
concept of democracy? Of civil liberties? Of privacy? Or, on the
other hand, do we need these kinds of abuses of civil liberties to
protect ourselves against terrorism? There are two sides of this
issue It s a complicated issue Snowden wanted to trigger a debate
and he has failed, because as you say, the drama of the personal saga
of Edward Snowden what s going to happen to him, where he is
going to go, where his girlfriend is, he looked so young all
these personal dramas [have taken the spotlight] And I would guess
that Snowden, who seems to be a very serious and purposeful man, is
himself disappointed because his purpose, as he says, and I
believe him, in making these revelations is making a conversation in
the US about these surveillance practices, which, because of his own
drama, hasn t happened yet and it may never happen And Sophie,
let me add a matter that is absolutely never discussed in the US, but
it s profound: Obama says, the US government says, the Senators
say, the Media says, Showden should come home and stand trial ù
Well, in some ways, if he could get a fair trial, if he could be out
on bail the way Daniel Elsberg was 30 years ago when he took the
Pentagon papes while he is preparing his trial, and he could tell a
story, and he could build a legal team, and he could have an
open court case with all the rights the defendants have, that means
that he could have all sorts of officials involved with this case,
right up to the vice president and the president of the US I cannot
imagine that the Obama administration or any US administration would
permit that, therefore I doubt very seriously that Obama is sincere
when he says that Showden should come home and stand trial But I
would guess that if Snowden was given these guarantees of being out
of prison and on bail and free to have an open trial he might come
home But he is not going to get those guarantees, I would guess,
because we live in a different era, here in America too Sophie
Shevardnadze: I want to talk a little
bit more about what has changed, whether the whole NSA leaks have
changed the American society Because if you talk about me and people
around me, who have a post Soviet hangover or had a Soviet
childhood these revelations weren t life changing for us, because
we suspected surveillance in some form or another Many RT viewers
are strongly against any form of surveillance, but still, I know a
lot of Americans that are around and they are not saying Hey, at
this point we re done with the government ù For example,
Larry King, he told me that he is actually siding with the government
on surveillance What do you see around you are the people still
shocked, or they are digesting and accepting it in the name of the
War on Terror? Steven
Cohen: I understand what you are saying
about your Russian colleagues surveillance is a problem in Russia
too and it has been a problem for decades And there is a debate in
the Russian media whether the FSB the Russian intelligence agency 
is doing too much or too little And let s be fair, people in
Russia and in the US are afraid of terrorism If you asked me, would
I allow the US government to listen to my phone calls and read my
email if they are going to prevent my children from being killed in a
terrorist explosion in New York City where I live, I would
undoubtedly say, Yes ù I ll just be a little more careful in
what I say on the phone and what I write in the email But this is a
major question, and times have changed I m old enough to remember
the Osborne case, when he took the Pentagon papers which documented
the Pentagon and White House line about the war in Vietnam, and then
the New York Times published them Then they were published very
quickly as a book, and Elsberg was on the radio, and on television as
it existed then He was out on bail and famous lawyers came to defend
him And in the end, he was exonerated in a way He won in the
courts That America doesn t exist anymore partly because of what
happened in 9/11, and partly because we fought so many wars Many
Americans are afraid and we have become more accustomed, decade by
decade, to this kind of surveillance So the question that Snowden
raised is, Should we become accustomed to it? Is this really a
trade off between our fears and our privacy that we want to make? ù
But I agree with you, the polls have shown I don t remember the
last number that the polls revealed but about half of Americans or
even more were okay with what the government was doing But Sophie,
you know as well as I do that when you take a public opinion poll,
you can give the answer you want by the way you ask the question If
you say in general to Americans are you prepared to give up all
your freedoms that Americans have fought for, for 200 years, and
allow the government to do this kind of possibly illegal
surveillance, a majority would say No ù But if you ask people,
 Are you prepared to permit this surveillance so that you and your
children are safe?, ù the majority is going to say Yes ù It s
just in how you ask the question and you can t ask the question
until you ve had a national discussion which we haven t had and
which the government doesn t want but what Snowden wanted But
again, until Snowden s personal drama ends, or at least calms down
and moves off the front page, we re not going to have that
discussion in our country And even then, we may not have it because
the government doesn t want it Sophie Shevardnadze:Welcome back to the show We re talking about Snowden and how his
Moscow detour can affect the already shaken relationship between
Russia and the US Our guest is Steven Cohen, professor of Russian
Studies and History Good to have you back, Steven So, in your
latest opinion editorials, you keep saying that Russia and the US are
at a hateful crossroads Is Snowden s case icing on the cake? Could
things get really bad after this? Steven
Cohen:I have a historical perspective 
Let me state it again, 22 years after the end of the Soviet Union We
do not have a good relationship with Russia Nobody asks why Rather,
in the US, when people are asked Why, ù they will say it s the
fault of Russia Now they say it s the fault of Putin But that is
not correct and certainly not a complete answer We had several
opportunities to establish partnership with Russia in international
affairs The first came in the 1990s after the end of the Soviet
Union, and Clinton with Yeltsin war set opportunities The second
opportunity came after 9/11, when Putin called President George Bush
and said We are with you, what can we do to help the US which has
been attacked by terrorism? We re partners ù That opportunity was
lost Then came Obama s so called Reset ù with then President
Medvedev, and that opportunity was lost Now, the tragic bombings in
Boston and the tragic civil war in Syria have shown Washington and
Moscow that we need a cooperative relationship and that created yet
another opportunity It s not clear whether we will seize the
opportunity with Snowden the Magnitsky act and other events have
become obstacles on both sides to seizing these opportunities The
larger reason in my opinion which is a minority opinion in America
 is that my generation knew as the Cold War between the Soviet Union
and the US either didn t actually end with the Soviet Union, or
it s come alive again Because everything we ve seen between
Russia and America since the end of the Soviet Union looks, smells,
and behaves like a Cold War relationship It s just that in the US,
our leaders don t want to accept this failure that they lost an
opportunity in post Cold War Russia to create a new relationship, a
partnership with Russia And that s where we are today So it s a
long way to answer, but I think that historians will tell you in the
future and as a historian today, I would tell you that we can t
understand Snowden We can t understand Magnitsky We can t
understand these recent conflicts without putting them into
historical context of a relationship between America and post Soviet
Russia during the last 22 years This is a narrative that hasn t
stopped Sophie
Shevardnadze:You just demonstrated
that obstacles or opportunities to get two countries closer or get
them more apart arise all the time and these talks of the Cold
War have been around forever, or in the past 15 years You seem to be
pointing out that we are now at a hateful crossroads How much worse
are things are now than they were in the Bush Era? Because it seemed
like they were at the lowest then Steven
Cohen:The low point of the
relationship since the end of the Soviet Union was of course the war
with Georgia in 2008 And the reason that that was a low point is
that the US and Russia came close to hot war, not just Cold War 
Georgia began the war, no doubt about that Russia reacted by moving
into South Ossetia It began the fight with the Georgian army which
was, in effect, an American proxy army We created that army We
armed it We trained it There were American military advisors
somewhere in the Georgia, traveling with the Georgian troops There
was a discussion at the White House, led by Dick Cheney, that the US
should bomb the Russian army in South Ossetia Sophie
Shevardnadze:But no one stood up for
the Georgian army there because no one really wants to wage a war
with Russia That s another example of how America and Russia would
never actually go to war Steven
Cohen:I don t know about that,
Sophie Where is that written, that we would never go to war? We were
extremely close in the Cuban Missile crisis, we were extremely close
in Berlin on a number of occasions There were probably occasions
that we haven t been told about, and in my judgment we were close
in Georgia in 2008 No fault of Russia but how many times can we
avoid these dangerous possibilities? My point is, it s the duty of
leadership American leadership and Russian leadership to create
a relationship where these dangers don t appear And we haven t
done that yet And I will say as an American patriot, the primary
fault not the entire fault but the primary fault is in
Washington Until American policy toward Russia changes, things will
not get better And American policy toward Russia hasn t changed on
one fundamental issue: Washington believes in what it calls
 selective cooperation, ù which means Russia should make
concessions but Washington does not have to make concessions in
return Until that policy changes, nothing else will change I am
absolutely sure about that Sophie
Shevardnadze:Does that mean that they
don t want a better relationship with Russia? They simply don t
care enough to ameliorate their relationship with Russia? Things are
good as they are? Steven
Cohen:The American political policy
media establishment wants a good relationship with Russia once it s
on America s own terms And it s very clear what that means,
because it has meant the same thing since the Soviet Union Russia
should be a junior and subservient partner to American interests 
Whatever is in the American interest, Russia should help promote So,
if America decides to expand NATO to Russia s borders, Russia
should accept this as a very good idea to its own security If
America decides to build missile installations in Europe or on ships
that threaten Russia s nuclear security, Russia should understand
that that s really against North Korea or Iran, and it doesn t
affect Russia If the US believes that the overthrow of Assad in
Syria will bring peace to the Middle East, Russia should agree The
problem is, Russia doesn t agree Russia is a different
civilization, but the bad precedent was set I don t like to
criticize your leaders because it s your problems by Yeltsin, who
agreed almost on everything And so Washington got into a habit of
getting what it wanted But even ambassador McFaul has said on a
several occasions during the reset ù which he claims he invented,
 We re going to negotiate with Moscow, and see what they can do
to promote our national interests ù Fine but that s one hand
clapping A real negotiation, real diplomacy, is not that It is
that we go to Moscow and say Here are our interests, will you help
us? ù And then Moscow says, We might Here are our interests 
Will you help us? ù And then they do something for each other 
Washington doesn t do anything I would defy anybody who thinks I m
being unpatriotic just tell me one major concession that Moscow
has received from Washington since the end of the Soviet Union? Just
one? And when I ask this question, at all just, leading places of
the American establishment, I do get one answer: We gave them
financial loans in the 1990s ù Yeah, they were onerous loans which
only Putin, because of high oil prices, could finally pay back 
Although Washington forgave Poland s communist era debt, it never
forgave any of Moscow s debts We have never given Russia
anything By the way, Putin says that over and over and over again,
and Washington says, Why is he so anti American? He is not
anti American, he just made a very simple point that any major leader
would make that a relationship is a two way relationship: We give
something to you, you give something to us, and we go forward and
solve problems We don t have that relationship and we haven t
had it since the Soviet Union ended We had it with the Soviet Union,
but that s another story Sophie
Shevardnadze:The Reset ù idea 
is it all forgotten and dead now? Steven
Cohen:In America, it s something
that Obama s enemies use to show how unwise he is and say it
failed The reality is that Obama got what he wanted from the Reset ù
 he got Russian help in supplying NATO forces in Afghanistan He
got tougher sanctions against Iran He got Moscow s cancellation of
the C 300 defense system, I think The problem is, once again what
did Moscow get in return? Nothing They wanted a compromise on
missile defense They wanted the end of NATO expansion and an end to
American democracy promotion in Russia But Washington refused So
the Reset ù failed, Washington got what it wanted, and now we are
starting all over again The new d√©tente we used to call it
 d√©tente ù during the Cold War is going to fail unless
American policy changes It s a sad story, but it s a true story RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/snowden-case-us-russia-307/

"13 Jul, 2013",UN human rights chief says whistleblowers need protection,"In her first reference to whistleblower Edward Snowden s case, UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay has called on all countries to protect the rights of those who uncover abuses and stressed the need to respect the right for people to seek asylum Commenting on the fugitive former US intelligence contractor, who
 is presently wanted by the US for leaking classified details of
 its surveillance programs, Pillay noted that undue surveillance
 could amount to an infringement of human rights National legal systems must ensure that there are adequate
 avenues for individuals disclosing violations of human rights to
 express their concern without fear of reprisals, said
 Pillay Snowden s case has shown the need to protect persons
 disclosing information on matters that have implications for
 human rights, as well as the importance of ensuring respect for
 the right to privacy, ùshe added Snowden appeared with human rights activists during a press event
 at Sheremetyevo International Airport on Friday, during which he
 expressed thanks for all offers of support or asylum I have
 been extended, ùwhich so far include Venezuela, Bolivia, and
 Nicaragua At the same time, Snowden indicated that he would seek asylum
 fromRussia, at least for the time being, until such time
 as travel to Latin America would be possible Meanwhile, the White HousewarnedRussia not to offer the former intelligence
 contractor a propaganda platform, ùwhile the US
 ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, called a member of the
 humans rights delegation on Friday and asked her to pass on a
 message to Snowden that he was not considered a whistleblower by
 the US, reports the Guardian The US is currently attempting to extradite Snowden to stand
 trial on charges of espionage Pillay, however, stated on Friday
 that even legitimate national security concerns had to be weighed
 against proper safeguards, in tacit support of Snowden s case While concerns about national security and criminal activity
 may justify the exceptional and narrowly tailored use of
 surveillance programs, surveillance without adequate safeguards
 to protect the right to privacy actually risks impacting
 negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
 freedoms, she said Pillay referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which
 stipulate that no one may be subject to arbitrary interference
 with their privacy, family, home or correspondence Reliable information regarding human rights violations on the
 part of an intelligence agency were most likely to come within
 the agency itself, according to testimony by a former UN expert
 on human rights in counter terrorism cited by Pillay Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously stated during a
 July 1 press conference that Edward Snowden might remain in
 Russia, but only under the condition that he stops divulging
 sensitive US government information If he wants to remain here there is one condition he should
 stop his work aimed at inflicting damage on our American
 partners, ùPutin said During Friday s press conference, Snowden indicated that he would
 once again seek to remain in Russia, in compliance of the
 Kremlin s terms ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/un-chief-snowden-protection-048/

 contractor seeking asylum The Russian authorities should be able to decide on Snowden s
 asylum request in two to three weeks time, he added Meanwhile, Russia s presidential human rights ombudsman Vladimir
 Lukin suggested that it would be better for Snowden to ask the UN
 or the ICRC for refugee status instead of seeking asylum in
 Russia That way it won t harm Russian American relations, he
 added The US Embassy called several rights activists before their
 meeting with Snowden, asking to deliver the official American
 stance on his actions It is true that I received a call from the American Embassy
 in the name of [US Ambassador to Russia Michael] McFaul, in which
 I was asked to deliver to Snowden the US official stand, which
 says he is not considered a rights activist, that he broke the
 law and therefore must be made accountable, ùLokshina

 same as voiced by Vladimir Putin earlier, he added Should Snowden apply for asylum, Russia will consider his
 request, Peskov said Russia was one of over twenty countries to which Snowden sent
 asylum request according to Wikileaks President Vladimir Putin
 said then Snowden maystay in Russia, if he wants to, but only if he stops
 activities aimed against the United States There is one condition if he wants to remain here: he must
 stop his work aimed at damaging our American partners As odd as
 it may sound from me, ùPutin told a media conference in
 Moscow In Putin s opinion, Snowden considers himself a fighter for
 human rights ù and it seems unlikely that he is going to stop
 leaking American secret data However, Russia is not going to extradite Snowden, the president
 underlined Russia has never extradited anyone and is not going to do so 
 Same as no one has ever been extradited to Russia, ùPutin
 stated Snowden, by sincere conviction or for some other reason,
 considers himself to be a human rights activist, a fighter for
 the ideals of democracy and human freedom Russian human rights
 activists and organizations, as well as their colleagues abroad

 cancellation of Barack Obama s visit to Moscow in September if
 NSA leaker Edward Snowden was still in Russia at that time President Obama is expected to visit Moscow in early September to

 comment on the current situation regarding Edward Snowden saying
 only that all information about the official US position are
 contained in earlier statements by President Obama and the

 told the press that the US President still intends to visit
 Moscow in September, as planned, regardless of the situation with

 Security Council, also told the press that the reports of the

"15 May, 2013","New spy game post-Boston? Russia, US seek common ground amid scandal fallout","The Kremlin has expressed regret over the Moscow spy scandal, saying signals sent by the US leadership were not heard by the CIA Russia is to contact the CIA director over the matter Russian President Vladimir Putin s foreign affairs advisor Yury
Ushakov on Wednesday called the alleged spying activities of the US
diplomat Ryan Fogle surprising, ùsaying that a clear
signal ùsent by US leadership on constructive cooperation of
Russian and US special services was not heard by effectors on
US side ù A constructive response ùfrom Putin will be delivered to
Obama on May 20 21, Ushakov stated However, it will not
influence ùthe meeting of the countries presidents at the G8
Summit, he added Meanwhile, the Russian side will seek to contact CIA Director
John Brennan about the matter, Ushakov said He reminded that the
Russian and the US intelligence agencies should now be working not against each other but side by side ù Russia s presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also expressed
concerns, saying the situation will not contribute to
strengthening mutual trust between Russia and the USA and to
bringing our relations to a fundamentally new level, ùas cited
by RIA Novosti Russia s counterintelligence agency announced on Tuesday itcaught a CIA agenttrying to recruit a Russian Federal
Security Service (FSB) officer The detained man is identified as
Ryan Christopher Fogle, a third secretary of the Political Section
of the American embassy in Moscow Following brief detention Fogle
was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave Russia as soon
as possible The spy scandal comes at a time when Russia and the US find
themselves engaged in a joint effort to find solution to the Syrian
crisis, having agreed to hold a peace conference Almost all
experts agree on the bad timing for the spy news No doubt that the new spy scandal has broken out at an
extremely inappropriate moment for both sides just four weeks
before Obama Putin meet in Northern Ireland and only a month after
President Obama s national security advisor Tom Donilon s visit to
Moscow with a personal letter from Barack Obama to Vladimir
Putin, ù Sergey Strokan, a contributing journalist to RT,says Russia s foreign minister, however, appears to take the spy
scandal a little more lightly Sergey Lavrov found it unnecessary
to discuss the issue with his American counterpart during talks
which were held the same day news of the CIA spy detention
emerged John Kerry didn t touch upon it, and I decided it would be
irrelevant to talk about something, which is already publicly
known I guess it is all clear, ù said Lavrov as cited by
Itar TASS Deputy Spokesperson for the US State Department Patrick Ventrell
was grilled by journalists at a Tuesday press briefing All he was
able to come up with though, was confirmation that an officer at US
Embassy in Moscow was briefly detained and released US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul spent about an hour at
the Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, having been summoned
there in connection with the spy detention However, he refrained
from giving any comments on his visit The ministry s website explains McFaul received a declaration
saying Russia condemned the fact that a CIA representative trying
to recruit a Russian Federal Service officer was acting under the
cover of the US Embassy Meanwhile, the media reaction has ranged from mockery to serious
insight into the alleged spy s motives The Wall Street Journal describes it as an episode that
appeared more costume party than spy thriller, ù which typifies
the jeering in the press But the Western media had been equally quick to ridiculethe British spy rock, ùwhich caused a
diplomatic row with Russia in 2006 until the UK finally admitted
it really was an MI 6 device early last year Former CIA officer Ray McGovern believes the costume party 
could be due to the spy s lack of professionalism If one assumes that the story is reasonably correct, it does
look like he was entrapped, just like the FBI entraps 99 per cent
of the so called terrorists here in this country You can entrap
people by leading them on and it very much looks like, if this
story is correct, that this fellow was not very well trained and
that he was entrapped, ù McGovern told RT When asked how come the spy episode occurred amid Russia s and
US intelligences being in close cooperation, sharing information
on the Boston bombers, the former spy replied there is no such
thing as a friendly intelligence service You can cooperate very
closely with another intelligence service, but friendly is beside
the point ù The Russian intelligence officer who Fogle has been trying to
recruit is said to be a North Caucasus expert The CIA might well
be interested in getting first hand information on the region, as
it is where the Tsarnaev brothers, accused of carrying out the
April Boston Marathon bombings, come from The brothers were under observation by both the Russian and the
American secret services, but that somehow was not enough to
prevent the tragedy, with both sides later blaming each other for
unanswered requests and alerts Following the bombings the FBI, together with some US diplomats,
visited Dagestan to meet with the Tsarnaev brothers parents and
obtain more information about the elder brother s stay in the
Caucasian republic The US agents are said to have been shocked by their Dagestan
experience as they had to move around the republic s capital in
armored vehicles, according to the Kommersant daily The newspaper
also assumes the telephone numbers of Russian FSB agents could have
been obtained by the CIA following that trip by American officials

"4 Apr, 2013",Prosecutors claim some Russian NGOs violate ‚ÄòForeign Agents law‚Äô,"A senior Russian law enforcer has told the press that some Russian non government organizations are receiving their funding from abroad, but failed to register as foreign agents He warned these organizations could face sanctions in the future The current situation is as follows: the finances keep
coming from abroad, but no organization is registered, ù First
Deputy Prosecutor General Aleksandr Buksman said on Thursday He added that the current large scale inspections in various
Russian NGOs would most likely influence the situation and the
first registered foreign agents would appear The official also noted that the inspections were not over yet,
but NGOs, mass media and even some foreign countries already
accused the law enforcers of biasness Buksman emphasized that the
work was planned six months ahead and prosecutors were simply doing
their jobs when they launched probes into the NGOs activities Also on Thursday, US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul spoke
at a roundtable dedicated to most urgent issues of cooperation in
the field of non governmental activities and other political
activism The diplomat expressed hope that the large scale inspections of
NGOs would not lead to a crisis in Russian US relations, but noted
that his country was concerned about the development However, when the ambassador faced a question about why the
bypassing of Russian laws was being discussed at a state level, he
replied that this was a problem of Russia and Russian laws with
which the Russian authorities have to deal In late March this year Russian prosecutors, investigators and
taxmen launched a large scale audit of all Russian NGOs, including
the branches of international majors such as Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and Transparency International The activists labeled the probes as pressure and warned that
they could lead to significant decrease of NGO activities in
Russia US, German and French diplomats, as well as foreign media,
also expressed concern over the situation A White House representative said that the US would find ways to
bypass the restrictions and would continue to fund the Russian
groups using foreign based platforms Russian law enforcers and Foreign Ministryreplied with statementsthat the probes were
absolutely lawful and their plan had been drafted long ahead The ministry alsoblasted the US promise of fundingas direct
instigating of certain non governmental and public structures to
violate legislation related to the work of non governmental
organizations in the Russian Federation Last year Russia introduced the Foreign Agents law, which
requires all groups that receive foreign funding to register with
this status Sponsors of the act claim that it defends the
interests of Russian voters who would be better informed about the
sources of income of certain politically active NGOs Many activists claim that the law threatens the very existence

Bastrykin told reporters on Wednesday that his agency would use the
international agency Interpol in order to bring criminal
responsibility upon US citizens whose adopted Russian children die
in suspicious circumstances In cases when the US authorities fail to duly react to the
deaths of children who are Russian citizens we will prosecute these
persons harshly and directly, ù Bastrykin said The official
noted that he also spoke of the people who were released by the
American justice system ù and that the suspects would be
prosecuted under Russian laws The top investigator reminded the reporters that recently
Russian law enforcers have instigated 22 criminal cases against
adoptive US parents The statement came after Texan officials issued a report saying
that they did not plan to press charges against Alan and Laura
Shatto, the adoptive parents of Russian three year old boy Maksim
Kuzmin, who died in hospital on January 21 Maksim s death occurred soon after Russia introduced the
controversialDima Yakovlev Lawbanning all US adoptions It
was named after a Russian boy who died after his adoptive American
father left him locked in a car in hot weather When Russian Ombudsman for Children s Rights Pavel Astakhov
learned about the new case he announced that Maksim Kuzmin had been
murdered by his adoptive parents, alleging they had also given
psychotropic drugs to the child US specialists confirmed neither
of this charges, saying that the boy s traumas were self inflicted
and that no drugs were discovered in his body Russian authorities demanded that the US side present all
documents concerning the case, including the autopsy report and
other forensic papers, as even after the adoption the boy remained
a Russian citizen The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the Texan authorities 
decision raised serious questions and Russia s top Human Rights
official, Konsantin Dolgov, said that the ruling was extremely
strange, as it presented the situation in a way in which a small
child died a violent death and still his adoptive parents bore no
responsibility Dolgov added that this case matches the general pattern of
leniency demonstrated by the US law enforcers and courts towards
the adoptive parents of Russian orphans However, the US Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul has said
that the US side had provided Russian diplomats with exhaustive
information on Maksim Kuzmin s death The ambassador noted that he
was ready to meet with Russian MPs and with Astakhov to discuss the
issue of international adoption Violence against children is horrible We have common
enemies in this sphere It is necessary to fight against these
common enemies, McFaul told reporters The Russian lower house has already invited McFaul for a
discussion on the adoptions issue, but the ambassador turned down
this request, quoting the generally accepted rules for US
diplomats Russian legislators replied by expressing surprise, saying that

"27 Feb, 2013",Sealing the deal: Can Kerry and Lavrov fix the reset?,"As two veteran US and Russian statesmen met for talks in Germany, observers applauded early signals that relations between Moscow and Washington are on the road to recovery Or was it just another golden photo opportunity? Reports of John Kerry s first meeting in his new post as the US
Secretary of State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were
mostly upbeat Perhaps the most glowing assessment of the talks
came from US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who declared via
Twitter: Good start! ù However, despite the enthusiasm over this inaugural meeting
between two prominent political figures, it is difficult to shake
the feeling that we have been here before That despite the warm
gestures and proffered pledges for partnership and cooperation, the
United States and Russia appear as two ships passing in the night,
each bound for completely different destinations From Moscow s perspective, it would require immense optimism not
to view with some suspicion and even more cynicism any promises
held out by the United States After all, since that electric
moment in March 2009 when Hillary Clinton and Sergey Lavrov jointly
activated a mistranslated reset button (the Russian word
for overload was used instead
of reset ), to the broken telephone incident between
Kerry and Lavrov, Russian US relations have come full circle Or it could be argued that technological metaphors have not
served the relationship very well Earlier this month, speculation of a Russia US breakdown was
rife when it was reported that John Kerry had attempted and
failed to reach Sergey Lavrov by telephone on two
occasions † The Foreign Ministry explained that Lavrov had
been traveling in Africa at the time of the missed calls However,
could anybody really blame Lavrov if he had deliberately refused to
pick up the receiver? After all, the Russian minister has certainly witnessed his
share of pledges of cooperation from the United States go up in
smoke Indeed, Washington deserves a large share of the blame for
not moving the reset beyond the merely rhetorical stage For
example, the US and despite all the hyperbole of a reset with
Moscow has been reluctant to bring Russia on board the US missile
defense shield project planned for Eastern Europe, just miles from
the Russian border Naturally, Russia views this system as a threat
to its national security and a destabilizing factor in the
strategic balance of forces Despite Moscow s repeated warnings of
another arms race unless the two sides find a compromise on the
issue, the position of the US and NATO remains intractable The US missile defense system, however, is just the tip of the
iceberg as far as Russia US relations are concerned From the
smoldering Arab spring, to the ongoing Syrian crisis, compounded by
the Iranian nuclear showdown, Washington, which seems to relish its
role as the global beat cop, may be forced to conclude that it is
impossible to confront these multiple global challenges without
Russia s invaluable cooperation Meanwhile, judging by some
recent events in Washington, the seeds for change may have been
already planted On the same day that Kerry and Lavrov were meeting
in Berlin, the US Senate confirmed the nomination of Chuck Hagel as
the new US Secretary of Defense Moscow views the nomination with cautious optimism, since Hagel
has endorsed cooperation between the United States and Russia on
the controversial US missile defense project, which he believes
would result in enhancing the security of both countries Another further sign that Kerry and Lavrov may have what it
takes to get the bilateral relationship on track emerged following
their meeting in Berlin, which Lavrov praised as quite
constructive ù On the thorny subject of Syria, the Russian minister said the
two reaffirmed their intention to do all Russia and the US can
do (to resolve the crisis) ù It s not that everything depends on us, but we shall do all we
can to create conditions for the earliest start of a dialogue
between the (Syrian) government and the opposition, he added Although the Russia US relationship has its share of obstacles,
it is clear that a bilateral partnership between the two nuclear
superpowers would only serve to enhance global security Now we will see if John Kerry and Sergey Lavrov can find the
political will in their respective countries to see the reset
through to fruition Robert Bridge,",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/moscow-washington-kerry-lavrov-reset-543/

information both from Russia and from the United States that
concerns the issue of protecting the children s rights In our
opinion only a dialogue would allow us to put an end to distorted
rumors and insinuations This is why we in the Public Chamber
decided to hold a roundtable and invite US Ambassador to Russia
Michael McFaul to it I hope that the honorable Mr McFaul can help
us to make clear the position of the US side over this issue, ù
the head of the Citizens Security Commission, Anatoly Kucherena,
stated according to the chamber s press service He also said he hoped that an open discussion could help to
establish close personal relations with representatives of American
NGOs who work in the adoptions sphere The Russian parliament has already invited McFaul to the
hearings dedicated to the fate of some Russian kids adopted by US
parents The diplomat officially turned down the invitation, saying
that it was not an established practice for a US diplomat to
testify before foreign parliamentary bodies However, he expressed
his readiness to meet Russian officials in private and discuss all
urgent issues The head of the State Duma international relations committee,
Aleksey Pushkov called McFaul s refusal a regrettable fact, but
noted that it only testified that the United States was not ready
for the serious dialogue Pushkov also recalled that despite the
alleged impossibility of speaking before foreign parliamentarians
in April 2012, Ambassador McFaul did take part in a roundtable of
the Russian Upper House committee for international relations
dedicated to the cancellation of the Jackson Vanik amendment The day after refusing the invitation from the State Duma,
McFaul published an extensive letter in Russian and English in his
internet blog In it he said that he was deeply concerned by the
way some Russian commentators were portraying the US legal system,
US diplomats and Americans in general It is time for sensational exploitations of human tragedy to
end and for professional work between our two countries to grow, on
this issue and many others, ù he wrote These complaints were a reaction to the latest outburst in the
comments of Russian officials and media over thedeath of
three year old Maksim Kuzmin(to whom Ambassador McFaul
referred by his adopted US name, Max Shatto) The toddler died on
January 21, 2012, but Russian diplomats and children s rights
officials claimed that they only learned about it in
mid February Russia s children s right ombudsman Pavel Astakhov initially
called Maksim s death a murder and suggested that the adoptive
parents were to blame Shortly afterwards he agreed that the
incident could be a case of manslaughter after Texas police said
they were still waiting for the autopsy report and it was too early
to incriminate anyone in what could be simply a tragic
accident Ambassador McFaul wrote in his blog that he was deeply
distraught ù to learn of Maksim Kuzmin s death This was the latest in a string of episodes in which Russian
children suffered from abuse or careless treatment by their US
parents Such cases and the alleged unwillingness of the US
authorities to cooperate with Russian consular services in them
caused Russia to approve the so calledDima
Yakovlev Lawearlier this year The law orders an asset freeze and entry ban on US officials who
are complicit of violation of human rights, but it also completely
bans the adoption of Russian children by US citizens and by proxy
of US organizations The bill caused broad controversy both in Russia and abroad, but
the authorities continue to develop this subject On Friday a district court in Moscow considered Russian
investigators request to arrest in absentia five US citizens
suspected of abusing their Russian adopted children The court
ordered the arrest of only one suspect Michael Grismore, whofaces

Just two and a half months later he was found dead, on January 21,
2013 Russia has reacted extremely critically to the fact that the US
waited almost a month before notifying Russian authorities about
what happened Even then, it was Texas law enforcement authorities
that spoke out, while the other US channels remained mute on the
subject Russia s Investigative Committee has launched a probe into the
death of Maksim, allegedly at the hands of his adoptive American
family Investigators stated they will be adding adoptive mother
Laura Shatto s name to the international watch list and applying
for her arrest The US State Department confirmed that it will assist Russia
with the investigation and help to coordinate talks with Texas On Tuesday, senior Russian embassy officials in the US, along
with a Houston consulate staff, have met with Texas authorities and
Maksim s stepfather They have confirmed that the local forces are
fully engaged in the case, and expressed hope that any indication
of a criminal component to the child s death will be dealt with
swiftly by the law The US Embassy in Russia has expressed condolences via its
Twitter account We deeply regret the death of the child in Texas A death
of a child is always a tragedy, ùthe statement said It would be irresponsible to make conclusions on who
is responsible for the death [of Maksim] before autopsy results are
analyzed and the investigation is complete, ùthe statement
from the US embassy in Moscow read US Child Services is also investigating claims that the child
was severely abused, but thus far cannot verify anything, stated
Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) spokesman Patrick
Crimmins There had been several reports of physical abuse and neglect,
but the authorities are still waiting for final autopsy results and
thus far no arrests have been made and no suspects identified An investigation usually takes around 30 days, but when the law
enforcement is also involved it may take longer, said the
spokesperson ≠RT s Anastasia Churkina visited the area where the family s
home is, and reports on her Twitter account that Ector County

release on every death that occurs [there] She also tried to
phone the home, but it went straight to the answering machine,
saying are a reporter, we have no comment When
talking to the locals, it was difficult to ascertain how much was
known about life in the household, as the rural community appears
very spread out and people don t run into each other that
often Maksim died before medics called by Shatto arrived at the scene,
Russian Children s Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov stated, quoting Texan
authorities Preliminary evidence showed that the boy suffered
multiple injuries to his head, limbs, abdomen and internal organs
prior to death The Russian Foreign Ministry s special representative for human
rights, Konstantin Dolgov, stated that such wounds could only
be caused by strong blows Maksim was reportedly beaten by his adoptive mother, who had
also fed him strong psychotropic medication Risperdal, which is
used for short term treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorders and approved for prescription in the US starting from the
age of 10 Yet the Pechorski foster home, from where Maksim came, stated
that he did not suffer from any mental illnesses and had no
abnormalities when it came to mental and intellectual
development The Russian investigation also revealed that Maksim was adopted
along with his brother Kirill from the same foster home as Dima
Yakovlev, an 18 month old Russian boy who died after his adoptive
American father left him locked inside a vehicle for an extended
period of time on a hot summer s day The new Russian Dima Yakovlev Law , which bans all US adoptions
in Russia, is named after him Maksim s adoption procedure is being looked into separately,
including checking whether his relatives were contacted to approve
the adoption Under the law, Alan and Laura Shatto had to undergo medical
check ups in Russia as well as in the US before the court gave the
green light to the adoption Doctors in both countries said the spouses were mentally and
physically healthy, Yulia Pron, a spokesperson for Pskov regional
court told Lifenews tabloid She added that the couple had
presented all the required documents to the court In a Moscow clinic, Maksim s adoptive parents were examined by
eight experts, including a psychiatrist If at least one of the
specialists concluded that there were any kinds of problems, the
court would have denied them the right to adopt the boy, the press
secretary stated Maksim was born in the town of Pskov, near Russia s western
border with Estonia Upon arrival to US he was renamed as Max Alan Shatto by his
parents Alan and Laura Shatto, with whom he lived in Gardendale,
about 350 miles west of Dallas Maksim s death comes amid heightened Russia US tensions, which
center on adopted children The boy s death was less than a month
after the Dima Yakovlev Law was signed into law Russia has reacted sternly to the news that the US waited almost
a month to let Russian authorities know of the incident Russian Chairman of the Duma Committee on Foreign Affairs
Aleksey Pushkov believes that Maksim s death has become the last
point in the US adoption ban debate The death of another Russian three year old baby in the US

the US Again, the US authorities are silent, Pushkov
tweeted In response to the news Pskov Governor Andrey Turchak has
temporarily suspended all adoptions in the region Local Russian authorities will also be seeking custody of
Maksim s brother Kirill, who now has been transferred into the care
of the extended family of the adoptive parents It is still not
clear what will happen to him afterwards Kirill cannot stay in the US since their legal procedures

Journalists from the Novaya Gazeta newspaper sent the Duma Chairman a petition signed by more than 100,000 people in support of quashing the adoptions ban According to President Putin s promises, which he reiterated at his annual press conference on Thursday, any petition with more than 100 000 signatures must be considered by parliament On Friday Deputy Duma speaker Yuri Neverov confirmed that the Lower House would consider the petition, but added that it will only happen in January The whole bill, that was named after Dima Yakovlev, a two year old Russian who died from heatstroke after his adoptive US father left him locked in a car on a hot day, is a reply to the US Magnitsky Act the recently approved entry ban and asset freeze on Russian tax, law and court officials who, in view of the authors of the act, are guilty of violations of Human Rights Russia has blasted the Magnitsky Act as an attempt to influence justice in a sovereign country Russian politicians also promised their country would retaliate and prepared the Dima Yakovlev bill that also imposed a Russian visa ban and an asset freeze on US citizens who are allegedly complicit in violating the human rights of Russians However, after the Russian bill passed its first parliamentary reading last week, two MPs representing the majority party United Russia and the nationalist faction LDPR suggested

amendments and presidential plenipotentiary for children s rights said that the ban was a part of the older and broader program with the ultimate objective to bring foreign adoptions to zero Despite protests, on Wednesday the MPs approved the Dima Yakovlev bill with the US adoption ban included On the same day, 30 people were detained and fined for protesting outside the State Duma office in the freezing cold Vladimir Putin repeatedly addressed the issue of adoptions at the Thursday press conference and said that he also fully supported the move as it was not against the adoption as such, but against the United States justice that is often ignoring or treating with leniency the cruel treatment of Russian adopted children by their adoptive parents Besides, Putin called the situation when Russian officials are barred from taking part in the investigations a humiliation and said that it should be ended At the same time, the Russian President promised to take another look at the amendment on adoptions as well as at the recently signed Russia US adoption agreement, before signing the Dima Yakovlev bill into law The Upper House will consider the bill on December 26, according

Why would US sponsored NGOs want to conceal that funding?Michael McFaul: In terms of transparency, the Obama administration supports the general idea of transparency And we domestically have put a lot of effort into that As a government here it is called open government ù we have a very similar set of policies and programs that the president has pushed forward And internationally we have been very involved too We have something called the open government initiative ù that we signed up with other countries to have pledges to do that So, the principle of transparency, we think, is a good one People should know the sources of funding; no one has any trouble with that What we are finding more troubling is the notion that if one takes money from a foundation that is abroad, that group gets labeled as an agent ù of that country That is just not empirically true That is not true I, I can tell you, used to run an NGO when I was a professor at Stanford University We took money from all kinds of different sources, including foreign sources But nobody would ever confuse the center that I ran in Stanford as being an agent ù of those governments I took money, actually, to go to school from a foreign country the UK There is something called the Rhodes Fund and I was a Rhodes Scholar And thanks to that foundation, I was allowed to get my PhD Does that make me an agent of the UK government?So, we think, the principle of transparency is a good one The assumption that to take money from the Hitachi foundation in Japan or a British foundation makes you an agent of that government that is where we have a disagreement with the legislation RT: So, what were exactly the ways around ù the US Secretary of State was talking about?MM: Well, I think we will try to make this more international; I will try to internationalize things, to try to downplay the bilateral part of it And we want to work with the Russian government and with Russian NGOs because we believe the support is important It is important In my country we have hundreds of foundations, hundreds of foreign organizations, I am sure, tens of dozens of governments that actively work in the NGO world and political world We think that is good for our society as an open society and we want to see the similar kind of relations with Russia RT: Staying on the legislative part of it, the Magnitsky bill sanctions a number of Russian officials And many say it s been done to replace the cancelled Jackson Vanik act How much harm do you feel that has done to the reset between the US and Russia?MM: We in the Obama administration have been very clear: we want to engage with Russia, government and society, on security issues, economic issues, democracy and human rights issues And we do that every day I do that every day in doing my job in Russia What we don t want to do is to link issues which we think are unrelated So we have been trying very diligently to avoid linkage between, say, issues with respect to European security and trade, or issues with respect to human rights and security We deliberately are not pursuing a policy of linkage So, with respect to Jackson Vanik and PNTR (Permanent Normalized Trade Relations), we have worked very hard with the Russian government to assist them, and I am just quoting back Mr Putin himself, he said this to my president in Los Cabos [Mexico] a few weeks ago We helped with that process of Russia s accession into the World Trade Organization and now we need to finish our part of that by lifting Jackson Vanik We want to do that in one thing We also want to address human rights violations in Russia and, by the way, in all countries around the world We have looked very closely into the tragic death, the wrongful death, of Mr Magnitsky, the lawyer, and we have taken action with respect to that already And therefore, we don t see why these two things should be linked We don t think one needs to replace the other But we have a democracy, we have an open system, other senators, other members of Congress, other NGOs have spoken loudly on this It is a debate going on in Washington I don t know how it will end;

This retired Soviet colonel was a Senior Research Fellow at the NATO Defense College in Rome just before he was recruited in 1993 to join the Carnegie Moscow Center, created the same year by none other than Michael McFaul, the current US Ambassador in Moscow After nearly 20 years in the pay of the Americans Trenin was rewarded with his current post as director by his former boss, Rose Gottemoeller, who left Moscow in 2008 to join the State Department where she is now Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Big shoes to fill for Mr Trenin, but in Washington they know how to pick their cadre The board of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington features this world is truly small Kofi Annan himself Among the Endowments Funders and Supporters ù are George Soros s Open Society Institute, the US National Intelligence Council, the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Defense Department, and a collection of other private and public enthusiasts Of course the transition government ù and Yemen model ù are nothing other than regime change ù Honestly: we, Russians, brought up on Tolstoy and Chekhov, should be able to miss Washington s elementary school semantic traps Secondly, unable to push anti Syrian resolutions through the UN Security Council due to Russia and China s staunch resistance, Washington is building up a group of more than hundred nations more pliable to US pressure Such coalitions of the willing ù have been put together before, but this time the number of countries makes it look like a parallel anti UN construct acting as if it is replacing the UN General Assembly itself Such a gathering, despite total absence of legitimacy, is not just a talking platform French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told Le Parisien ù that the Paris meeting would push for a Chapter VII United Nations resolution to enforce the transition plan A Chapter VII resolution can authorize the use of military force to maintain or restore international peace and security In the short term, the United States may attempt to institutionalize this ad hoc grouping into a mechanism to implement a final solution ù to President Al Assad In the long term, Washington may try to solidify such structure into an anti U N body of sycophants, ready and willing to approve any U S initiative Now, from tactics to strategy Looking at the type of leaders that are seizing power in the Arab world with American assistance, a normal person is perplexed: why does the United States, with assistance of their local satellites, keep on removing moderate secular governments and bringing to power, in one country after another, increasingly radical extremists that same type of people who committed 9/11, the greatest tragedy in U S post WWII history?Indeed, this question is not solvable by listening to Washington s official line of arguments But take a look at the policies of the US and its European partners during the in the 1930s Then, America and its ever so reasonable and civilized European allies provided the financial, industrial and political support encouraging the highly energized, violent extremist Nazi and fascist movements in Europe With a purpose: to direct its violence against Russia According to the plan, Germany and Russia were to exhaust themselves so that the US would emerge dominant Similarly, the earlier use of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and again today the encouragement of various Muslim extremists including elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are part of the plan to create a regional movement which could be thrown against Iran, Russia and China Such a furnace of war and chaos in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia will permanently disable all three of America s strategic rivals and allow Washington to rise to uncontested world domination †We should be able to decipher not only US language, but also US strategy In the 1930s, the Soviet Union was at the front line of the fight against Fascism in Europe Today, Russia owes it to its history and to the fallen in the anti fascist struggle to recognize and before it is too late avert American designs We must prevent Russian and other people from being drawn into a bloodbath of mutual extermination in the voracious interest of Washington s drive for global hegemony",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-syria-transition-721/

it will be easier to talk then, Ushakov said The Kremlin aide then offered a few pointers to US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who has been on the receiving end of Kremlin criticism following some rather undiplomatic utterances McFaul should try to be more diplomatic, ù said Ushakov, who previously served as Russian ambassador to the United States Ambassadors should operate on a positive basis, because even without ambassadors there are plenty of all sorts of actors trying to spoil the atmosphere of the bilateral relationship, he continued Last week, for example, McFaul said at a meeting with students of the Higher School of Economics that Russia bribed Kyrgyzstan in order to close a US air base in the Central Asian country The Foreign Ministry said it was extremely perplexed ù by the US ambassador s remarks Ushakov said such remarks go against the spirit of bilateral cooperation The Russian and US leaders aim to maintain the most constructive cooperation, and the ambassadors should act precisely in this spirit, without bringing discord into the work of their own leaders, he said I noticed that McFaul has been fairly self critical and after each of his public escapades he would admit, Sorry guys, yes, I made a mess here But words are not like a bird † once they re out, you cannot catch them, the presidential aide said I tried to be more diplomatic, and he should still be diplomatic ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/obama-putin-russia-us-g20-mcfaul-reset-496/

Could it be China, or India, or Russia?The escalating violence in Syria provided a rather compelling background for Russia s presidential race this year The recent campaign was exceptionally difficult and stressful for Vladimir Putin, but he still scored a sweeping victory at the end of the day, thanks to the tens of millions of truly patriotic voters Putin s electoral triumph signifies Russia s victory in countering a foreign media aggression It means that Russia s consolidated forces of reason have effectively prevented a British led scenario for crippling Russia, February 1917 style However, the media warfare carries on That suggests a key priority for Russia s newly elected president, which is to promote the nation s spiritual development while maintaining stability, securing the state and the public against a global crisis in a situation of profound change in the global architecture Russia s spiritual progress would encourage positive change worldwide A spiritual Russia is capable of accommodating all the basic human and social values, such as justice, patriotism, diversity, etc Mass media and ideology are admittedly the weakest spots of modern day Russia s statehood A number of Russia s public institutions and practices apparently beg to be reformed in the nearest future, and proper interaction between the state and civil society is a desperate necessity All the more so since the recent election has demonstrated that Vladimir Putin and his policies no longer enjoy the kind of popular support they had some five or 10 years ago In this situation, the Russian government should adjust some of its policies, as well as propose a national agenda to the public, as in a set of underlying values in charting the nation s strategic development goals Such a national agenda should draw a nationwide discussion, enjoy extensive media coverage and ideological promotion, and be finalized through an all Russian Representative Assembly Vladimir Putin could announce the convocation of such an assembly while paying tribute to Kuzma Minin s monument in Nizhny Nogorod on 4 November 2012, scheduling the meeting for 7 January 2013 A new Russia could find its major national symbols in the great personalities of the past, such as Aleksandr Nevsky, Reverend Sergius of Radonezh and Reverend Seraphim of Sarov, scientist and educator Mikhail Lomonosov, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, poet Aleksandr Pushkin, writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, chemist Dmitry Mendeleev, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, etc Nationwide reforms need to be carefully deliberated and planned, and then implemented swiftly and decisively Among the top priorities, all branches of power should engage every civil society institution and every political party in discussion over the essence of the much needed change with regard to mass media and ideology To that end, expert analysis will be indispensable Successful examples of such crucial deliberation in the middle of a crisis can be found in world history, including Russia s own history Nizhny Novgorod citizen Kuzma Minin spearheaded a historic process of national consolidation and revival that enabled Russia to resurge from the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century That why it is so important to analyze the historic experience of the all Russian Representative Assembly of 1613 †A comprehensive, nationwide public discussion on a new national agenda to be finalized by a Representative Assembly could enable Russia to overcome disunity and endure the looming political crisis Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, specially for RT",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-putin-ideology-panarin-535/

"10 Mar, 2012",March 2012: Media warfare targets Putin‚Äôs legitimacy,"The opposition rally in Moscow on March 10 is yet another act of media warfare against Vladimir Putin s resounding victory in the election, and the opposition and Western media are aiming to undermine Putin s legitimacy believes writer Igor Panarin In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view The media campaign against Vladimir Putin has failed to accomplish the main objective for its Stage One, which was to take Russia s presidential election to a second round Mr Putin scored around 64 per cent of the vote, which is even more than what the Russian Public Opinion Research Center had predicted prior to the election This is probably one of the reasons you could see tears in Putin s eyes during the rally in his support, which took place in Manezhnaya Square on the night of March 4 and attracted some 110,000 people: these were tears of happiness over such a convincing victory †You have to consider the enormous pressure he was exposed to throughout the campaign and during the vote count, both internationally (the crisis in Syria) and domestically (street protests of the opposition backed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael McFaul, and virulent campaigning in the Internet, which the pro Putin party had completely lost) However, the surge in protest activity following the parliamentary election last December only boosted Putin s vote total in the long run, as it urged all the sane and patriotic minded Russians to show up for the election in order to counter the threat †I myself went to vote around 12:30 pm on March 4 The voting procedure was excellently organized Everything was calm and orderly, and the police guarding the polling station performed smoothly and were polite There were public observers present I even had to wait in line a little, with six other people casting their ballots ahead of me There were generally many more people at the station than at any other election previously, which means voter turnout was high this time †There was generally an air of balance and reason at the polling station Voters were very diverse in terms of age, ranging from students to senior citizens As I was leaving to go home, there was a flow of people heading in the opposite direction something I have not seen for a long time in Moscow †If we were to imagine the average pro Putin voter, it would primarily be a sober minded conservative who believes Russia needs a strong government In this sense, Putin s supporters are somewhat similar to those of Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov Most pro Putin voters are workers united in trade unions Naturally, there are also the military, the secret services and the defense industry Even though there have been some very impressive decisions made with regard to pensioners, the elderly demographic was dispersed among Putin, Zyuganov and the leader of the Fair Russia Party, Sergey Mironov As for the supporters of Mikhail Prokhorov, they are mostly people aged between 20 and 40, successful professionals who look forward to realizing their full potential But I am sure there is something they do not realize, namely, that if Russia were to have a weak government, they would soon be disappointed †I believe Vladimir Putin is the only possible leader capable of managing a smooth transition to a Eurasian Union in a situation where the European Union has all but collapsed The world needs an economic powerhouse that would be stable and reliable, and that is what Russia should become This would bring more investment to the Russian economy, which would essentially enable us to drastically improve our quality of life †Putin s biggest problem is the fact that no one bothers to explain this rationale Therefore, the area of PR and ideology is where we are failing, since no one in particular is in charge of it That is why Russia needs to introduce a state ideology (Spirituality, Greatness, Dignity) I think the only way Vladimir Putin will be able to complete his presidential term is by introducing such a notion to the Russian Constitution following a comprehensive, nationwide public discussion †Also required are media support and public awareness efforts to back a future Eurasian Union and its integration vehicles †Meanwhile, the recent opposition rally of March 5 marked a new stage in media warfare against Russia By inciting unrest in Moscow s Pushkinskaya Square, the opposition has embraced the tactics of provocation Notably, the signal for such a transition came from London The Guardian announced a battle to unfold in the next 24 hours ù as early as the morning of March 5, essentially proving my point about deliberate interference in Russian affairs on the part of Great Britain †The new objective of the media campaign against Russia, including the rally on March 10, is to undermine Putin s legitimacy and force him to resign, with the ultimate goal of destroying Russian statehood The nearest deadline is supposedly August 2014 †Vladimir Putin s deposition would mean turmoil for Russia He is the only political personality in today s Russia capable of accomplishing economic integration across Eurasia, making Russia a global center of gravity in political and economic terms However, to that end Mr Putin would need to respond to certain challenges and get rid of some dead weight among his entourage In fact, the recent protests were largely aimed against a certain personnel policy rather than Putin personally What irritates people is the fact that certain ministries or state owned companies are headed by incompetent and unprofessional executives who keep their offices merely thanks to being close to Vladimir Putin †Thus, I believe, there are attempts at destabilizing Russia being orchestrated from abroad Their purpose is to weaken Putin s standing as much as possible, ideally removing him from power, with the ultimate goal of preventing further integration in Eurasia With that in mind, Russia urgently needs an efficient system of media defense which would include both state owned and private assets, to protect the

"7 Mar, 2012",Anti-Russian sentiment spikes in US,"Moscow and Washington are at loggerheads as Russia which just overwhelmingly voted Vladimir Putin into the presidential office for the next six years demonstrates it will independently pursue its own foreign policy agenda Tensions between the two countries broke to the surface following a recent UN resolution vote on Syria, which is experiencing a protracted conflict between government and opposition forces The resolution would have demanded that Syrian government forces retreat from conflict zones and essentially lay down their arms Russia, alarmed that the document made no similar demands on opposition forces, vetoed the resolution What followed next was a not so diplomatic tit for tat between American and Russian diplomats US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed Moscow s veto as despicable, ù while the Russian Foreign Ministry responded that Washington s reaction was hysterical ùAlexey Pushkov, head of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, did not betray any secrets when he told reporters on Tuesday that not everyone is happy about Russia s independent foreign policy There are opinions that Russia must become a servicing partner, although this idea is not favored by everyone and everywhere, he added The Duma deputy then mentioned Putin s stand on foreign policy, outlined in a pre election article, in which the president elect warned that foreign actors on the geopolitical stage may be tempted to solve their problems at someone else s cost by means of force The president elect said that Russia should never be in a situation where it may tempt anyone by our weakness ùPutin s warning took on immediate relevancy this week when US Senator John McCain called on fellow colleagues to support a military offensive against Syria The time has come for a new policy, McCain said during remarks on the Senate floor The United States should lead an international effort to protect key population centers in Syria, especially in the north, through air strikes on Assad s forces Although McCain s plan ultimately failed to generate enough support, his comments underscore the tendency on the part of many US politicians and planners to jump headlong into military action † in direct opposition to Russia s stated foreign policy Meanwhile, with US presidential elections scheduled for November, the Republican nominees are wildly playing the Russian card in an effort to win their party s nomination What the world witnessed in Russia yesterday was a mockery of the democratic process, ù Mitt Romney, a leading Republican nominee said following the announcement that Vladimir Putin had won Instead of stating that it congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the presidential elections, as the Obama administration has done, it should have condemned the flagrant manipulation and media restrictions that marred this election ù(It would be fair to add that Russia s presidential elections had hundreds of thousands of observers at polling stations around the country, as well as the use of video cameras, causing many foreign observers to applaud Russia s coordination of the elections) Romney suggested that President Obama s Russia policy is set back ù rather than reset ù, yet provided little clue as to how the Republicans would set forward ù US relations with Russia, especially given the Republicans recent track record on military misadventures The tit for tat over elections has a rather long history between the two countries In December, Putin expressed his irritation with Washington s response to Russia s parliamentary elections, which provoked an outcry from the political opposition, who said the vote was rigged I looked at the first reaction of our US partners, ù Putin said The first thing that the secretary of state [Hillary Clinton] did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers ù She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal, ù Putin continued They heard the signal and with the support of the US State Department began active work ùThe situation between Moscow and Washington hit more turbulence in January with the announcement that Michael McFaul would be the new US ambassador to Russia, making him only the second ambassador to Russia in 30 years who is not a career diplomat It took just hours for McFaul to attract the wrath of his Russian hosts Pushkov said McFaul had attracted criticism by his own actions taken during the first hours on Russian soil, ù referring to a meeting held between the US ambassador and several members of the political opposition shortly after McFaul assumed his duties It is one thing when such a meeting with representative of the opposition is held in a calm atmosphere, and quite another when it happens as the political situation escalates in Russia in the run up to the presidential election, Pushkov said Meanwhile, on Monday night, as the police arrested some protesters who had gathered in the center of Moscow, McFaul posted on Twitter: Troubling to watch arrests of peaceful demonstrators at Pushkin Square Freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are universal values ùThe Russian Foreign Ministry replied in its own Twitter post: Police on Pushkin were several times more humane than what we saw in the breakup of the Occupy Wall Street protests, the tent camps in Europe ùGiven the increasing tension between Moscow and Washington over critical foreign policy questions, which include the US desire to plant a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe, just miles from the Russian border, it will be very fortunate if the tit for tat attacks remain in the form of harmless tweets ù

"9 Feb, 2012",Comparing Oranges‚Ä¶,"Pro Kremlin politicians and pundits explain the recent mass protests as an Orange Revolution ù conspiracy orchestrated by the West Member of the Russian Public Chamber Nikolay Svanidze believes the allegations are a hoax to demonize the opposition In the article below, historian and analyst Nikolay Svanidze explains his view One of the wings of Russia s political spectrum appears to be constantly dominated by hysteria, blaming every instance of public discontent on machinations by the US Department of State A number of parties and politicians are back to the habit of spotting American spy games behind everything This has become the favorite and most commonly employed argument for those backing the Putin government, culminating in a pro Putin rally at the Poklonnaya Hill memorial park on February 4, where speechmakers were getting out of breath stigmatizing the Orange plague ù Sadly, the government itself eagerly relies on this type of supporters Vladimir Putin, for one, has publicly endorsed the Poklonnaya Hill rally Many pro government pundits and observers have rushed to announce a change of tide, ù claiming that pro government rallies are attracting several times more people than opposition protests However, that is an acute case of wishful thinking It is common notion in Russia that official appraisals of rallies strength are notoriously biased, overstating the turnout at pro government events and downplaying protest attendance numbers several times over In fact, the word opposition ù is not really legitimate in this context, as the rallies that attracted tens of thousands of people in Moscow and other cities last December and last week were mainly attended by regular citizens who feel that the existing system of governance deprives them of their civil and political rights It was after Prime Minister Putin denounced the protests and their participants using his rather characteristic choice of derogatory speech that the protest movement indeed turned oppositional Whereas the initial December protests merely demanded that Head of the Central Election Commission Vladimir Churov should resign on account of election fraud, Putin s explicit contempt for the discontented made him the prime target of public scorn As for the two simultaneous and directly antagonistic rallies that took place in Moscow on 4 February 2012, they are hardly comparable While both events were attended by upwards of 100,000 people each, there was a striking difference as regards content While the opposition protest that re assembled at Bolotnaya Square on February 4 had its clearly defined messages and demands, the pro government rally at Poklonnaya Hill had but one purpose: to stick it ù to the Bolotnaya crowd The Poklonnaya meeting was merely a reaction to the Bolotnaya protests, its speakers and slogans being evidently focused on pinning an Orange Revolution ù accusation on the protest movement Another thing that revealed how these two events were a world apart was organization Those at Bolotnaya Square came by their own free will, every activist and organizer being a volunteer Of the thousands who made up the crowd at Poklonnaya Hill, the majority were either paid to show up or intimidated into participation by their employers or other authorities I would not rule out that there were also people who came to the memorial park out of their sincere confidence in Vladimir Putin, but numerous reports and revelations show that the rally owed its formidable numbers to administrative mobilization and none of the official rebuttals have so far effectively proved the opposite I have to give credit to the Kremlin s own political consultants, though: staging street action to juxtapose it to an opposition rally was tactically a smart idea However, strategically it is a terribly hazardous gamble, for you effectively pit one part of the populace against another Presenting political opposition as a bunch of unpatriotic upper middle class rascals who deserve to be stomped upon by the good common folk is not only dirty, but also suicidal In whipping up hysteria over a fictional revolution, you risk instigating a very real civil war In a highly stratified and diverse society such as Russia, the Kremlin s current divide and conquer tactics may turn out to be a Pandora s Box But back to the notorious Orange Revolution ù speculation Fingering the world s biggest and most ambitious power as the mastermind behind all things evil has repeatedly proved a highly efficient argument among a certain share of Russian society used to the Cold War era reality of the United States being our country s principal adversary Not to mention the perennial trick of finding a foreign enemy to blame for domestic policy failures But let us take a sober look at the global chess board Is Russia challenging the US to global supremacy? Have we been gearing up for war with America? Do they have a reason to perceive us as a threat to be neutralized? If not, then why on Earth would the Americans, tied up as they are with an unwinnable war, a severe economic downturn and social unrest at home, commit so much effort to overthrowing a Russian leader whose trumpeted opposition ù to them has been little more than rhetoric? A popular argument in favor of the Orange conspiracy ù theory is the Ukrainian experience While American influence is admittedly presumed behind the Kiev street protests that propelled a pro Western government into power in 2004, the political situation in today s Russia is only superficially comparable to that in Ukraine seven years back, while its is crucially different in essence In similarity to several post Soviet states, there is a powerful anti Russian sentiment in Ukraine that can be played as a mighty trump card by anyone who wants to rally support for their agenda or political ambition which is exactly what the Ukrainian liberal opposition did In Russia s case, it is not the opposition stirring enmity against a fictional foreign nemesis to impress the public, is it? Secondly, whereas both Ukraine and Georgia had distinct liberal posterboy politicians who enjoyed wide popularity as well as good standing with Western embassies, there is presently NOT A SINGLE liberal politician in Russia who could boast any significant public support Each and every liberal politician in this country is notoriously mistrusted and scorned, and even the recent multi thousand strong street protests explicitly positioned themselves as a no leader movement Should the White House indeed entertain a notion of spinning a prot√©g√© into presidency in Russia, which personality could they possibly spin?Finally, the liberals in the United States might indeed be happy with the prospect of having a more like minded, liberal administration in Moscow to deal with But what are the odds of such a liberal democratic government seizing and keeping power through a revolution in a country like Russia? Meanwhile, the prospect of raging chaos and a civil war in a country armed with nuclear missiles think the Americans want us to have a revolution, you must be seriously underestimating their wit for self preservation Nikolay Svanidze, special to RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/orange-revolution-mcfaul-bolotnaya-881/

Well, McFaul is a professional He never fails to pick the right people In 2006, the project Da! ù initiated by Navalny and Gaidar, started receiving donations from the National Endowment for Democracy (McFaul is still on the NED s board of directors) As part of the program to initiate an orange coup ù in Russia, McFaul sent Navalny to study at the Yale University as part of the Yale World Fellows program in 2010 After a thorough comparison of the psychoanalytical portrait (apparently, for reflexive governance purposes) of a Russian Viktor Yushchenko, huge foreign grants were opened Therefore, the author of the Aleksey Navalny project is none other than Michael McFaul Maria Gaidar has temporarily fell out of the race (went to study in the United States) after a major scandal in Kirov surrounding her name (Maria Gaidar was allegedly involved in a car crash causing the death of a 13 year old girl) Immediately after his arrival in Moscow on January 14, Michael McFaul got down to business very actively He carried out several meetings with opposition leaders (January 17 and 22), addressed the public live on Echo of Moscow radio a media stronghold of the Russian liberals Then on January 25 he gave an interview to the influential Kommersant newspaper, and on January 30 he participated in Vladimir Pozner s TV show on nationwide Channel One Aside from media publicity, he started working thoroughly on making anti Putin rallies in Moscow more creatively (together with the founder of the oppositional Novaya Gazeta, former president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev) It seemed that the February 4 rally was bound for success However, the reshuffle in the Kremlin at the end of December 2011 led to a change in Vladimir Putin s election campaign strategy and the beginning of real counter actions to the anti Putin information campaign Also on February 4, despite the freeze of minus 20 degrees Celsius, Poklonnaya Hill saw a huge rally Though it is even hard to breathe in such cold weather, around 140,000 people gathered together, according to police And this is a big achievement of the new head of Vladimir Putin s election campaign Vyacheslav Volodin (First Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office) †So, McFaul has lost, but he has lost only in the first round of this confrontation Time has shown that he knows how to withstand pressure, quickly gets adjusted to a changing situation, and he obviously has some secret plans of how to put the Aleksey Navalny project into life So, it is too early for the Kremlin to relax the fight to prevent chaos and to preserve the Russian statehood is yet to come Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, special to RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/mcfaul-opposition-rallies-panarin-667/

political situation in both countries After two months of relative calm last year, Occupy rallies resumed with renewed fervor in various cities across the US The surge in street protests was coupled with a new political battle between America s Democrats and Republicans in Congress over a sudden increase in the US national debt The difficult compromise negotiated by President Barack Obama on 2 August 2011, which had allowed Washington to avoid a sovereign default, turned out to be a mere respite By mid November 2011, US public debt had topped $15 trillion, putting America on the brink of default yet again On 13 January 2012, President Obama requested the House of Representatives to raise the US debt limit by another $1 2 trillion This was supposed to be a mere formality, prearranged by the President s deal with Congress struck back in August The White House estimated that the new increase in the debt ceiling would help the administration avoid a default until the nation would be through with the presidential election scheduled for November But what had been expected to be a rubber stamping procedure, suddenly turned out to be a stonewalling when the House voted down the president s request on January 18th This unexpected violation of the deal between the White House and Congress has effectively undermined Barack Obama s chances of re election, and subsequently

Secretary of State, who was visiting Russia at the time This might have been the reason for Dr Kissinger s decision to have a private conversation with Ambassador McFaul one day short of his meeting with Vladimir Putin Mr McFaul mentioned his meeting with Henry Kissinger in his blog, adding that the former Secretary of State continues to work on promoting the crucially important dialogue on strategic partnership between our two nations ù Vladimir Putin has previously referred to Henry Kissinger on numerous occasions as a foreign policy expert whose opinions are highly valuable In his book published in 2000 and titled In the First Person: Talking to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader gives a glowing account of his first encounter with Kissinger in the early 1990s Kissinger strongly impressed Putin during their first conversation, telling him about his own background in intelligence He also opined that Mikhail Gorbachev s decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Eastern Europe in the late 1980s was premature, adding that he had never quite understood Gorbachev s motivation The one time chief of US diplomacy is still considered an outstanding expert in international relations today His credentials as one of the prime architects of the US Soviet d√©tente in the 1970s are the reason why his meeting with Vladimir Putin on January 20th focused primarily on promoting the dialogue between Moscow and Washington The Russian Prime Minister set the tone for the meeting, cordially addressing Kissinger in his welcoming speech: You and I have a long standing history of highly positive relations I consider you one of the most sophisticated foreign policy experts, including the area of US Russian relations ù Kissinger promptly returned the compliment The account of the meeting and its context invite a number of conclusions The meeting took place merely four days into Michael McFaul s tenure as US Ambassador to Russia, signifying acknowledgment of the fact that the two countries relations are strained and ridden with tension, which can possibly upset the balance of power, and have an adverse affect on stability, globally Kissinger s underlying task of reintroducing shuttle diplomacy to US Russia relations reveals that the two nations foreign policy makers have exhausted their options for compromise over the contentious missile defense issue, which is becoming ever more evident as both parties increasingly tend to resort to Cold War style rhetoric and accusations A clear cut example of the latter can be found in the recent public statement made by Russian Space Agency Director Vladimir Popovkin, who suggested that the US might be behind the mysterious crash of Russia s Phobos Grunt satellite The White House seems somewhat surprised by Russia s dramatically toughened attitude vis √† vis Washington s drive for a military operation against Syria or Iran The public statements circulated by the Russian Foreign Ministry and National Security Council on 12 January 2012 were reinforced by an impressive naval exercise performed by a Russian aircraft carrier group in the Mediterranean The wargame demonstrated Russia s growing military potential, as well as its readiness to step in to prevent a Western military gamble in the Middle East The Putin Kissinger meeting offered one of the few remaining opportunities to avoid a further escalation of tension between Russia and the United States It becomes even more meaningful once you consider that Vladimir Putin is an undisputed presidential frontrunner, while Henry Kissinger happens to be a foreign policy guru for GOP, whose candidate is highly likely to become America s next president, come November I am convinced that friendly relations based on mutual respect and a balance of interest would benefit both Russia and the United States I hope such meetings will continue and eventually contribute to easing the tension in US Russia relations Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor

leave politics yet, and might run for the presidency again in the future I would very much dislike events in our country to develop according to a revolutionary or other extreme scenario, ù Medvedev said at a meeting with Moscow State University (MSU) journalism students But, frankly speaking, I don t see sufficient preconditions for that, ù he added The president said that his attitude to the current political situation is more balanced, thanks to his life experience Medvedev recalled the dramatic events of the early nineties Today there is some disorder, too Perhaps, in that sense I can t be entirely happy with what I ve done in the past four years, ù he confessed But I am confident that our country doesn t need any revolutions, ù Medvedev underlined The head of state pointed out that he does not abdicate responsibility for what is going on in Russia, adding that any person who becomes president must be ready for everything ù If one decides to run for the country s top job, one should understand that the fate of millions of people depends on you ùAnswering a student s question on whether Medvedev would be ready to appear before a people s court, the president said that he is not afraid of anything Otherwise, I wouldn t be able to serve as president, ù he added want a clear answer, then yes, I m certainly ready to die for my ideals, ù Medvedev stated And those are not only the Constitution, but also such ideals as family, children, and so on ùSpeaking about the recent mass protest rallies that swept through Moscow and other cities following the December 4 Duma election, Medvedev admitted that some of his supporters might have been among the protesters unhappy with the tandem s ù decision concerning the March 4 presidential poll On September 24, at a convention of the United Russia party, Medvedev announced that he supported Vladimir Putin s candidacy for the forthcoming presidential election On November 27, a second party convention endorsed Putin s nomination Talking to young journalists on Wednesday, Medvedev said that even though he would not link this directly ù to his refusal to run for president, some protesters perhaps wanted the scenario to develop in a different way, and would rather see him taking part in the upcoming election But this time I really decided not to run for reasons of political suitability, because I thought that two people representing the same political force must not elbow each other The one who currently perhaps has slightly more chances of winning should go ahead, ù Medvedev said However, Medvedev does not plan to leave politics yet I ve never said that I will never run again Let me remind you, I m only 46 which isn t such a serious age as to refrain from further political battles, ù he observed The president also expressed his views on the recent parliamentary vote I have experience of observing elections since 1991 No matter how much criticism these elections received and there certainly were violations, some of them outrageous perhaps these were the cleanest elections in our history, ù Medvedev told the students At the same time, he said that we should work together on improving the electoral system, ù so that votes would give rise to fewer questions The president pointed out that there have always been, and will be election violations and attempts to falsify the results But we should ensure that everything is under public control, ù he said Medvedev also touched on Moscow Washington relations, saying they have not got worse, just as his relations with American President Barack Obama have not deteriorated He expressed hope that the new US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul will take into account the country s specific framework and act within his mandate Preliminary, my colleague Barack Obama informally came to agreement with me over this figure, ù Medvedev said The president added that he knows McFaul personally and feels he is a sensible ù person However, the Russian leader did not rule out that tensions between the two powers over the American missile defense system in Europe may worsen in the late 2010s Medvedev admitted that Russia and the US have serious differences on the planned defense shield Censorship in the media was also discussed at the meeting on Wednesday According to the president, this problem exists due to the large number of state media outlets in Russia In some cases, the state polishes the situation [in the media] This refers to both federal and regional media, ù he said As a possible solution, Medvedev suggests creating a public TV station What has to be decided now is, what independent source could finance it The president s meeting with students lasted for 2 5 hours, during which he answered several dozen questions from future wordsmiths ù

It probably will, if it withstands the missile defense test So far, there have been strong doubts about it, which have grown even stronger since the pre term deployment of the radar in Stelogorsk On 28 December Russian President Medvedev introduced his Voronezh DM radar The radar is capable of detecting up to 500 ballistic and cruise missiles launched from land as well as ocean within up to six thousand kilometers Similar radar, Voronezh M has already been deployed in Lekhtusi, outside St Petersburg, and another Voronezh DM radar, in the Armavir district, Krasnodar Region The United States made their statement in response to deploying the radar in the Kaliningrad Region This radar became a symbol of Russia s readiness to respond to deployment of the anti Russian missile defense system in Europe The US representatives said that an option of agreeing with Russia was still out there But they have doubts about it The trick is that soon, the architect ù of the reset between Moscow and Washington, Michael McFaul, will soon become the US ambassador to Russia His candidacy has been approved by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations At the hearing regarding his statement, even McFaul said that the US Presidential Administration would deploy the US missile defense system regardless to whether it improves its cooperation with Russia in this matter or not Thus it will be quite difficult to reach an accord between Russia and America The Russian President has recently listed a number of potential response measures Among them was the deployment of Iskander missile complexes in the Kaliningrad Region Iskanders can carry conventional or nuclear warheads † † † Russia could also reinforce its asymmetric response ù with a number of efficient foreign policy tools For instance, Moscow should revisit its current collaboration with the United States on a number of significant issues, such as the transit of supplies for the US military effort in Afghanistan Notably, Russia can gain additional leverage on Washington now that the United States is about to fall out completely with its long standing strategic partner Pakistan over the recent friendly fire ù incident Following a misguided NATO air strike that killed 24 Pakistani servicemen, thousands of enraged locals took to the streets in Karachi and several other cities across Pakistan to protest US military presence One of the protests featured a burning effigy of President Barack Obama, as well as US flags similarly set on fire Pakistan s top brass have slammed President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for what is seen as their excessive reliance on America This has prompted Islamabad to react swiftly and furiously to the air strike, entirely shutting down the transit corridor for the coalition forces stationed in Afghanistan, and issuing a statement demanding that the US troops should clear the Shamsi air base in the province of Balochistan within 15 days This demand poses a serious impediment for the US led coalition in Afghanistan, since the Pakistan transit corridor used to be the shortest and most convenient supply route for the allied troops This puts Russia in a position to seal the only remaining passage for coalition supplies to Afghanistan a move that could urge Washington to think twice with regard to its plans for a European missile shield By taking advantage of the current bottleneck situation, Russia could effectively prevent the United States from deliberately targeting Russia s nuclear deterrence capabilities, and therefore destabilizing Europe and sparking a new Cold War A 100,000 strong US force could be trapped in Afghanistan with no food and ammunition supplies, haunted by the plight of the British with Elphinstone s Army, which was isolated and totally massacred in Afghanistan in 1842 I personally hope that all American GIs presently stationed in Afghanistan will safely make it back home, and that the US will give up on it plans on encircling Russia with its missile defense architecture in Europe, signaling its commitment to further promoting the US Russia reset ù in 2012",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-reset-missile-033/

"18 Oct, 2011",‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô as alternative to missile defense,"In a move to overcome the Russia US deadlock over the missile defense, Moscow has reportedly come up with a new initiative: a global system to guard against missiles as well as asteroids and other threats from space According to the plan, the system would be created jointly by Russia and NATO under the control of the United Nations, reports Kommersant newspaper As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia has the veto right and, therefore, would be able to influence the development of the project The idea was put forward by Dmitry Rogozin, Moscow s envoy to the security alliance, writes the daily, citing diplomatic sources The package of proposals has yet to be formalized The idea has been nicknamed Strategic Defense of Earth ù as an allusion to The Strategic Defense Initiative better known as Star Wars ù † suggested by former US President Ronald Reagan in 1983 The costly and highly criticized plan for ground and space based systems intended to make America invulnerable to nuclear attacks The point of the Russian Star Wars ù initiative is to focus on fighting threats coming from space rather than just missiles The Washington backed missile defense shield is customized purely for countering missiles launched somewhere in the Middle East, ù a source told Kommersant Moscow proposes a different approach It would be an integration of anti aircraft, missile and space defenses Thereby, the system would be targeted against possible threats to Earth coming from space, including asteroids, comet fragments, and other alien bodies, ù the source is cited as saying The system should be capable of both monitoring the space and destroying any dangerous objects as they approach our planet The plan mulled over in Moscow uses American logic † their habit of thinking globally The missile defense idea that Washington currently sticks to does solve a global task: it saves the US and its allies from missile threats [The Russian] concept gives an opportunity to propose [the US] even a more global task to save the world And also do it together with us rather than on their own, ù Kommersant s informant noted According to the paper, President Dmitry Medvedev showed interest in the proposals and instructed Dmitry Rogozin and presidential aide Sergey Prikhodko to work further on the initiative However, no official confirmation or comments have followed so far Last week, Washington made it clear that the negotiations with Moscow on the missile defense shield in Europe had reached a dead end Michael McFaul † the recently nominated US ambassador to Russia and a chief architect of the President Barack Obama s policy of reset of relations with the Kremlin † announced that the US had no plans to provide any legally binding guarantees that the defense system would not be targeted against Russia Moscow, though, continues to stand firm in its position The Russian side wants the US to provide not only legal guarantees that there is no threat, but also the exact parameters this system may possess the number of interceptor missiles, their location, speed and range All this must guarantee that the missile defense system in Europe will not weaken the Russian strategic potential Moreover, the guarantees must be provided not only by the United States, but by NATO as a whole, Dmitry Rogozin told NTV channel on Tuesday, cites Interfax agency NATO, within the framework its joint responsibility, must say something to Russia too The Russian envoy added that if the guarantees cannot be provided during Obama s tenure, they will be given under another administration ùA deployment of Iskander M missile systems in Russia s northwestern military district of Leningrad may become one of the arguments in the row, writes Izvestia newspaper Following McFaul s statement, Russia s Defense Ministry announced of a creation of a first brigade that would entirely

without serious additional expenditures, ù the official said in an interview with Russia s Profile magazine The American plan to deploy elements of its defense system in Eastern Europe has been a bone

"14 Oct, 2011",Missile deadlock: ‚Äòarm-arm‚Äô replaces ‚Äòjaw-jaw‚Äô,"Both Moscow and Washington officially admit that talks on America s anti missile shield in Europe have stalled In the absence of progress, Russia has put in motion a military response to the shield, which it believes threatens its national security The military and diplomatic deadlock puts in question the reset of relations ù between Russia and America, which was praised as one of the major achievements of Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev Despite years of talks, Washington will not provide a legal guarantee that its antimissile system in Europe will not hamper Russia s strategic potential Michael McFaul, one of the architects of the reset ù, who is slated to become next US ambassador to Moscow, was the first American official to state this clearly at Senate hearings on Wednesday Due to the failure to find a diplomatic solution, Russia will seek technological means to face the challenge In an article in Friday s Kommersant daily, a Kremlin source was quoted as saying the counter to the American ABM will be cheap yet extremely effective ù America s intensions are increasingly clear They will build the AMD system and will not take our opinion into account Even if a miracle happens and they provide some legal guarantees, they would not be suitable They will cover five years tops, and the next president will easily dismiss them, ù the source said, outlining † Moscow s perception of the issue Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the US approach deceptive ù They tell us that all this is not against us, but on the other hand they refuse to fix it as a taken obligation And we want at least some legally binding guarantees that the system will not be aimed against us Now they do not want to give us such guarantees And without this we will have to look for other ways to ensure our own security, ù the minister said in an interview US deployment of an anti ballistic missile shield (ABM) in Europe has been one of the major points of conflict between Moscow and Washington for a decade In 2001, the Bush administration withdrew from the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone Cold War agreement which limited the superpowers ambitions to beef up their nuclear arsenals by guaranteeing that neither would develop means to defend against a missile attack A year later, Washington launched negotiations with former Soviet states in Eastern Europe The US was looking for future hosts for elements of the antimissile shield they had started developing The stated goal was to protect America and its European allies from missile threats from rogue states, namely Iran and North Korea However, Russia saw the move as a threat to its own nuclear deterrent Over the years, Moscow s discontent with the enlargement of NATO in general, and the development of the European ABM in particular, grew In February 2007, then President Vladimir Putin warned that Russia might withdraw from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty because it no longer served Russia s interests The treaty banned nuclear and conventional missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers Such weapons deployed in Europe were a major threat during the Cold War, and the superpowers eventually agreed that they posed too great a risk of an accidental war Russian General Stuff officially linked Putin s words with the European ABM In April 2007, Putin announced the suspension of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which limited Russia s ability to deploy non nuclear troops in its European region The ABM plans were not among the reasons given for the move, but security experts agreed that they must have been among the considerations In November 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia might deploy short range Iskander ballistic missiles in the Kaliningrad region From the Russian enclave in Eastern Europe, the missiles would be able to attack ABM sites in Poland and the Czech Republic The tension was defused after the newly elected President Barack Obama announced in September 2009 that Bush s antimissile plans for Europe were being scrapped They were to be replaced with a so called phased adaptive approach, which Moscow hoped would address its concerns The move greatly contributed to a major diplomatic thaw and the consequent signing of the New START strategic arms reduction treaty Medvedev suggested creating a joint Russian NATO system as part of new pan European security architecture Russia s hopes, however, proved to be futile Since 2010, the Bush era rhetoric has made a comeback in relations between Moscow and Washington The Kremlin did not believe in the White House s apparent chivalry and would not accept its promise not to use the AMD against Russia Russian skepticism may have been a response to an earlier broken promise, when Washington reneged on a promise not to enlarge NATO eastwards Russia s top brass say they have new strategic missiles in development, with the American antimissile shield in mind The ground and submarine launched missiles will have additional counter measures to penetrate any AMD system the US might deploy in decades to come, the generals promise Russia is also modernizing the control system for its nuclear ICBMs The goal apparently is to have improved dead man s hand ù communication lines, which would survive a pre emptive strike and be able to correct missiles flight plans towards new targets in case of a global war ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/us-europe-abm-deadlock-837/
"13 Oct, 2011",Michael McFaul on what a ‚Äúwin-win situation‚Äù means for America,"US President Barack Obama s nominee for US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, explaining why he should be appointed Washington s highest ranking diplomat in Moscow Michael McFaul, who is perhaps better known as Obama s architect of Russia policy, ù opened his remarks before the Senate Committee by providing a litany of accomplishments hammered out between Moscow and Washington since the reset was announced in early 2009 Rather than framing all interactions between the United States and Russia as zero sum contests for power and influence, ù he began, we look for ways to produce win win outcomes ùSo far, so good McFaul proceeds to rattle off examples of these win win outcomes, ù including the signing of a military transit accord with Russia, ù which is responsible for supporting more than 1,500 flights transporting more than 235,000 personnel ù over Russian territory and into Afghanistan, where US forces have been battling Taliban forces longer than their predecessors did in Vietnam This transit arrangement with Russia is a matter of vital importance to our troops ù as the transit route through Pakistan becomes more problematic, ù he added McFaul, whose family in attendance at the hearings created a scene of domestic bliss, also mentioned the ratification of the New START Treaty, which was signed by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev last year in Prague This treaty reduces our nuclear arsenals, but importantly also provides robust verification and transparency measures that will build confidence and predictability on both sides, ù he said †Obama s nominee for US ambassador to Russia then mentioned briefly some of the recent global hotspots Iran, North Korea and Libya † where US and Russia, while not always seeing eye to eye, were able to come to terms with each other s positions McFaul paid special attention to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has been subjected to four rounds of economic sanctions by the United Nations for its alleged refusal to cooperate with nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Iran says that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes On Iran, we worked closely with Russia to craft United Nations Security Council resolution 1929, which significantly expanded the multilateral sanctions regime, ù the possible next ambassador to Russia said McFaul then applauded Russia s multi billion dollar decision to unilaterally ù cancel the sale of S 300 surface to air missiles to Iran, which the Islamic Republic had been hoping to acquire, especially as the rumors of an Israeli preemptive strike on Iran s nuclear sites continue to gain traction Here, a disturbing trend begins to appear in McFaul s line of reasoning as to what constitutes a win win ù situation: whatever serves America s foreign policy interests in its dealings with Russia is automatically coined win win ù This type of one sided thinking, which has been a hallmark of Beltway strategy since at least the end of World War II, is also conspicuous when it comes to discussions about US Russian economic relations Here is McFaul speaking enthusiastically on the win win situation ù that will develop if Russia becomes a member in the World Trade Organization The (Obama) administration has been actively supporting Russia s accession to the World Trade Organization, since Russia s membership in the WTO will create new markets for US exports and increase opportunities for US companies, farmers, ranchers, investors, and workers, ù he argued As a WTO member, Russia will have to lower tariffs and liberalize the conditions under which American services can be sold in the Russian market, ù Obama s guru on Russia added It will be interesting to see how US producers respond to a steady stream of Russian products entering the country As far as supporting the termination of the Jackson Vanik Amendment, which has haunted US Russia relations for decades, McFaul believes this is a splendid idea because: we cannot afford to put our farmers, manufacturers, and workers at a disadvantage when competing against other WTO members for market share in Russia ùAlthough it is to be expected that every nation consider the domestic advantages of doing business with other countries, as well as defend their own interests, McFaul s arguments for cooperation with Russia are so one sided in favor of US interests that it is easy to predict some nasty potholes down the road The most glaring example of this one track train of thought involves Georgia, the Caucasian country with which Russia was forced into a military conflict in August 2008 There are clearly issues on which the United States and Russia are not going to agree and Georgia is one of them, ù McFaul bluntly told the Senate Committee Whether in bilateral meetings with the Russians, at international organizations or in multilateral settings, we have consistently and adamantly defended Georgia s territorial integrity ùMcFaul, a native of Glasgow, Montana, has never gone on record criticizing Tbilisi s decision to attack Russian peacekeepers and unarmed civilians, arguing instead that Russia s relations with its neighbors had been deteriorating at an alarming pace, ù which certainly ignores the reality of the situation Unfortunately, McFaul refuses to see any link between Washington s behavior in the region and how it has had an adverse affect on relations in the region It is no secret, for example, that US is serious about getting Georgia, and irrespective of its irresponsible behavior, its own shiny membership card in NATO From the very beginning of the Administration, we sought to reverse this dangerous trend, first by reassuring and strengthening our security ties with our NATO allies, ù he told the Senate Committee The United States, it must be remembered, has unilaterally declared war on numerous sovereign nations, and without the blessing of the international community (Iraq, for example) Meanwhile, Russia, which had not been involved in any war since exiting from Afghanistan in 1989, is still criticized by Washington for defending itself after Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili made the fatal decision to open a full scale military offensive against Russian peacekeepers and civilians in South Ossetia on August 7, 2008 It seems that Washington fails to appreciate the hypocritical impression it creates in Russia when they hear a US diplomat, the representative of a nation that is currently fighting in three wars, somberly tell Russia: There are no military solutions to this impasse, only diplomacy ùAlthough Michael McFaul certainly has the educational and professional qualifications to serve as the next US Ambassador to Russia, on the basis of his recent statements it seems that he will enjoy more success with his Russian hosts if he remembers that there are necessarily two sides to a win win situation, ù not just one ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/mcfaul-russia-ambassador-senate-us-779/

"6 Mar, 2011","Despite NATO invitation, Russia still waiting to join Euro missile defense","Two years ago, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov met in Moscow where they announced a reset ù in relations between their respective nations During their press conference, Clinton presented Lavrov with a mock reset button, symbolizing the renewed relationship between the two countries, which had been seriously strained during the two term presidency of George W Bush With the coming to power of the Democrat Barack Obama, a new dawn, it seemed, was on the horizon as far as US Russian relations were concerned Although Clinton s gesture was meant to be entertaining, it contained a small translation error that is interesting in light of present events Above the red reset button, the Americans had written the word peregruzka, ù which in Russian means overloaded or overcharged, , as opposed to the intended word for reset In some ways, however, the oversight has been quite prophetic to the true state of US Russian relations today, which could certainly be described as overloaded ùNow, the man who first coined the reset ù phrase, US Vice President Joe Biden, is scheduled to be in Moscow on March 9 10, where he will be meeting with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and other high ranking officials One of the main topics of discussion will be Russia s involvement thus far wholly hypothetical despite a promise delivered to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at the NATO Summit in November † in the US missile defense shield in Europe, a system that Moscow says poses a security threat without Russia s unconditional participation Where is the party ù Russia was invited to?Although the White House has named the signing of a missile defense cooperation agreement with Russia one of its top priorities in its relations with Moscow in 2011, things do not seem to be heading in that direction In her recent talks with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, Clinton said the US was committed to deploying in Poland new divisions of the US Air Force, complete with F 16 fighter jets, in addition to the already announced missile defense shield Dmitry Rogozin, the Russia s special envoy to NATO, said the statement by the US Secretary of State has raised fresh concerns in Moscow I think this statement will not be left without Russia s most close attention, Rogozin told Interfax on Friday In earlier comments made to Interfax, the NATO envoy said Russia would not join an already finished product ù We will not tolerate a situation in which we would have to join an already finished product developed without our participation and without our opinion considered This is not going to happen, Rogozin said after meeting with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and US Permanent Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder on Tuesday Russia proceeds from an invitation sent to us by the NATO secretary general on taking part in building a European missiledefense system, Rogozin continued We would like to know where we have been invited Are they inviting us to pass by a house where some party is going on? Or are we invited to attend this party? ùRogozin said Russia does not want some hypothetical threat of a missile attack on Europe from the south to be translated into practical plans for neutralizing our strategic nuclear potential ùAccording to an article by Kommersant, the Russian daily, Moscow will demand an explanation over Washington s plans to deploy fighter jets inside of Poland After all, the explicit reasoning for the US military buildup in the former Warsaw nation is to protect Europe from a rogue attack, ostensibly from Iran These missile defense plans are not new, ù a source told the newspaper We know them and hope to reach an agreement [over Russia s cooperation] within the European missiledefense project However, the wish to deploy an air base must be explained ùThe source told Kommersant the subject will be raised during President Medvedev s meeting with Biden on March 9 Will reset collapse over missile defense?Meanwhile, as anti government protests rock the Middle East and North Africa, The US announced it would dispatch a radar equipped warship to the Mediterranean Sea next week, the first step in the development in the missile defense The Pentagon announced that the USS Monterey, is a guided missile cruiser equipped with a sophisticated Aegis radar system, will leave next week for a six month deployment in the Mediterranean, the first phase in the unfolding missile defense system The missile shield will begin with ship based anti missile interceptors and radars, with land based radars added in southern Europe later this year The Pentagon has failed to announce the exact location of those radars The next phase of the missile shield will see land based interceptors deployed in Romania in 2015, followed by interceptor batteries in Poland by 2018 Again, the declared goal of the missile defense system is to protect NATO nations against medium range missile attacks, presumably Iran Russia, however, has said that any missile defense system that has the capability of compromising its own missiles will be viewed as a potential threat to its security We should go ahead with our plans for reducing strategic arms as well as in the field of missile defense, ù President Dmitry Medvedev said Since a missile defense shield may be an element of the strategic nuclear arsenal, Russia wants security guarantees We`ve unveiled our proposals and are ready for cooperation White House aide Michael McFaul said on Friday that missile defense was high on the agenda of the forthcoming talks between Biden and the Russian leadership in Moscow Referring to the question of US Russian cooperation on the European missile defense shield, McFaul said the Obama administration was trying to take an issue that used to be extremely contentious between the United States and Russia, and to try to see if we can make this an area of cooperation ù We believe that without some kind of cooperation on missile defense, it will be difficult for us to get on to the other negotiations about reducing strategic nuclear weapons further and non strategic weapons that are in Europe, he said, adding we hope that at some time this year we have agreement on that Russia and NATO agreed to cooperate on the European missile defense system at the Lisbon summit in November 2010 NATO insists there should be two independent systems that exchange information, while Russia favors a joint system that is open and transparent to both sides at all times Joe Biden will arrive in the Russian capital on March 9, Russian Presidential Aide Sergei Prikhodko told reporters We consider this visit a landmark event in the preparations for the US president s upcoming visit to Russia, which is scheduled for this year, he said The date of the US president s visit has not been determined yet ù ",https://www.rt.com/russia/us-russia-missile-defense/
"20 Jan, 2011",US snubbed Russian opposition pleas for help,"Russian opposition leaders and human rights activists pleaded with top US officials to support their plans for political and social change, but the request was apparently given short shrift by Washington Russia s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, which obtained fresh files from WikiLeaks, reports that the group was consistently critical of the Kremlin and wanted American help for reform The members of the opposition accused the US leadership of turning a blind eye to observance of human rights in Russia while at the same time seeking financial aid from America and even demanding US ideological involvement in their activities Those demands were voiced on a visit to Moscow by Michael McFaul, Special Assistant to The President for National Security Affairs and senior director of Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the United States National Security Council He met with opposition leaders at the residence of the American envoy to Russia in Moscow Read Gleb Pavlovsky on the issue here The opposition asked the US to be more critical of civil rights violations taking place in Russia, but not Bush like critical ù Those who were present at such meetings at the US embassy in Moscow also showed some evolution of their opinions over the years Previously, during George W Bush s presidency, they asked the US for softer criticism towards Russia, but these days it is a different story They seem to believe that there is a lack of harsh critics of Russian policies on America s part They even proposed discussing Russia s internal affairs in the format of representatives from the Russian and American governments and Russian NGOs, but Michael McFaul rejected the idea According to the reports, the opposition said: Washington should pay more attention to significant incidents related to freedom of assembly in Russia To solve problems in Russia s civic society, parties should sit down at the negotiation table † both Russian and US governments, and representatives from NGOs ùThe US response was, It is up to Russian activists to build up their relations with their administration, without relying on America ùLeaders of the Russian opposition also believe that the recent reset of Russia US relations has had a negative influence on human rights in Russia Activists, especially in the North Caucasus, have been saying that after the murder of Natalya Estemirova in 2009 the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, was given a carte blanche for other murders ù and should be recognized as a persona non grata by the US Michael McFaul answered that he does not see that happening and said the US would never turn a blind eye on human rights violations in domestic issues in Russia and would express its concerns out loud The report prepared by John Beyrle, the American ambassador to Russia, concluded that the opposition in Russia is unsustainable and immature He also reported that some members of the opposition asked for American help in registering new political parties The ambassador also reported that the opposition sees the possibility of Vladimir Putin once again running for presidency as the biggest threat to Russia US relations and that America should be involved to prevent that from happening Michael McFaul rejected the idea of American involvement in such activities altogether Oppostion: To further improve relations between Russia and the US, the Obama administration has ostensibly refrained from vocal support for democratic reform ùUS: Civil society activists in Russia are unaware of the contours of the US approach to human rights and its record of public statements and speeches Russia s democrats remain in near terminal disarray † constant personality disputes, disagreements with the Kremlin, differences over the viability of political activity ùIn his report to Washington, ambassador John Beyrle proposed that the US should make its position on human rights issues and democracy in Russia more clear to the members of the Russian opposition and explain to what extent the US is willing to be involved in Russia s domestic issues Michel Chossudovsky from the Center for Research on Globalization said it is no surprise that Russian opposition parties come knocking on the door of the US embassy The involvement of US officials with opposition parties against the Russian government should come as no surprise The Russian government is a government which states its point of view If the United States doesn t like this point of view, it will attempt to weaken or destabilize the existing government or [push for] regime change as it has in countries around the world And how does it undertake regime change?They establish links with opposition political parties, and of course

"20 Oct, 2010",Moscow looking for European ‚Äúre-think‚Äù at Munich Security Conference,"President Dmitry Medvedev met with members of the Munich Security Conference today to discuss prospects for a new European security architecture amidst a rapidly changing neighborhood The United States and Russia had their reset Now will Europe and Russia get their re think? Today s Munich Security Conference † a forum that was founded in 1962 by German publisher Ewald Heinrich von Kleist Schmenzin as a venue for discussing European and American security issues † is the latest effort by President Medvedev to draw attention to the need for a new comprehensive European security treaty that will extend its coverage from Vancouver to Vladivostok ù Medvedev s proposal for a new pan European security treaty could work if agreed upon, said Wolfgang Ischinger, the chairman of the Munich Security Conference (which included other high ranking officials and political analysts, including Carl Bildt, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden; Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US National Security Advisor; and Michael McFaul, Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs) The European security system, which we ve had for the last decade or two, has not worked very well, Ischinger told the assembly That was probably the reason why President Medvedev made fundamental proposals regarding an evolution of this security system I think he is right in addressing these issues Ischinger s comments echoed the reaction of Germany s Angela Merkel and France s Nicolas Sarkozy, who met President Medvedev in Deauville, France, on Tuesday But old habits die hard Therefore Moscow understands that this will be no easy sell Meanwhile, President Medvedev told the participants that it would be a mistake to confuse modern Russia with its Soviet antecedent Relations with Europe are one of the most important directions of Russia s foreign policy, he said This was the case in the Soviet period, and this is the case now, although [some in the West] are trying to liken Russia to the Soviet Union this is a big and serious mistake, ùMedvedev was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying I remember myself 25 years ago, ùhe said I was a different man, and although I thought then that I was a mature man who had already written Ph D thesis, I still had different views, in some ways more idealistic ones, in some ways I was less experienced ù A great number of people in Russia have gone the same path, ùhe continued Medvedev then suggested that the West should overcome the difficulties in the perception of processes that are happening in Russia ù He also reassured some critics that the meeting in France was not an attempt to split Europe, as some presumed I would not like such meetings as the one yesterday to be considered an attempt to split Europe, to split the European Union, to cast doubt on genuine intentions of states taking part in such events, ù he noted I think we all should act in accordance with the single European agenda ù I would not like such meetings as the one yesterday to be considered an attempt to split Europe, to split the European Union, to cast doubt on genuine intentions of states taking part in such events, ù he noted I think we all should act in accordance with the single European agenda ù In light of the chinks now beginning to show in the armor of the US military machine, which is attempting to hold down forts in both Afghanistan and Iraq, many observers believe the time is ripe for a real re think on European security Indeed, the European capitals have ignored the Russian part of the security equation for far too long Now with the threat of terrorism on the rise, and the Iranian question looming, this is no longer a feasible option The European Russian relationship is being equally challenged by Washington s determination to drop a missile defense system smack in the middle of Eastern Europe Naturally, Moscow views such a move as a direct threat to its national security These types of controversial activities are happening at the same time that a general thaw is taking place between Europe and Russia Yet the most significant changes in bilateral relations are happening almost as a matter of fate In April, Polish President Lech Kaczynski, together with his wife Maria and dozens of other political elite, was killed in a plane crash on the way to commemorate the Polish victims of the Katyn Massacre during World War II The tragedy united Poles and Russians together in mutual mourning, which revealed the human side of nations that is too often concealed behind the lifeless pages of history books and jaded newspapers Before this tragedy, the Georgian conflict of August, 2008, reminded much of the world albeit painfully slowly † that there is a knee jerk tendency in the West to paint Russia as the villain, even when the facts on the ground suggest otherwise Indeed, for the first 72 hours of that bitter conflict, the Western media completely ignored the Russian side of the story One Western news channel even had the audacity to set up cameras inside the office of President Mikhail Saakashvili, thus giving the Georgian leader 24 hour access to express his opinions before the global community Yet one year after the hostilities ended, the European Union released a 1,000 page report that blamed the Georgian side for starting the conflict with an early morning missile attack on South Ossetia But by then the PR damage was already done Little surprise, then, that calls for a European Russian re think regarding European Russian security structures are gaining momentum Russia celebrated a reset in relations with the United States under President Obama, ùcommented one retired Russian diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity Now it is time for a re think on security measures between Russia and Europe The Cold War is over; we really need to turn the page ù The Russian president proposed the creation of a new European security treaty in June 2008 In December, 2009, Russia delivered a copy of the draft treaty to the heads of states and organizations, including the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) At the time of the document s initial release, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he saw no need for the new security treaty proposed by Russia I don t see a need for new treaties or new legally binding documents because we do have a framework already, ùhe said at a news briefing in Moscow We have already a lot of documents, so my point of departure is: I don t see a need for new treaties But let me reiterate, we are of course prepared to discuss the ideas in the right forum, ùhe said The lukewarm response to Medvedev s came as no surprise, since Moscow believes it is time that NATO, which many in the Russian capital perceive as a lumbering dinosaur from the US Soviet ice age, should be phased out and replaced by a modern, European, security architecture Of course Mr Rasmussen has no desire to lose his job, especially during an economic crisis Meanwhile, the treaty would also place tough restrictions on the unilateral use of force by any nation, and this is certainly an amendment tailor made for the United States Thus, given this complicated background it will be interesting to see what will transpire when Medvedev attends next month s NATO summit meeting in Lisbon I will go to the Russia NATO summit, ùMr Medvedev said at the conclusion of the Deauville summit, formally accepting an invitation to the Nov 19 20 meeting of the 28 member military bloc This will further the search for necessary compromises and the development of dialogue between the Russian Federation and the North Atlantic alliance as a whole ù The possibility of Moscow co operating with the alliance on a European missile defense shield was also floated, but Medvedev, wary of such empty promises in the past that usually awarded Russia nothing more than spectator status, said he would have to hear more details first We are now evaluating the idea of this proposal, but I think that NATO itself needs to understand in what form it sees Russia joining this system, what it will bring, in what manner an agreement can be reached, and how to proceed further, ùhe said Only based on the evaluation of this proposal can we give an answer on how we will proceed with regard to the idea of European missile defense ù Meanwhile, Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ishchinger said the issue of Russia s participation is not a technical question, but rather a political question It is not a technical problem, but a core political issue, ùhe said at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Interfax reported If this problem is to be resolved, mistrust must be overcome in relations between the Russian and Western military and politicians ù Robert Bridge, RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/moscow-munich-security-conference/
