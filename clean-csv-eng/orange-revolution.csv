"10 Dec, 2019",Key takeaway from Ukraine peace talks in Paris is that Zelensky‚Äôs best friend is Putin,"The Paris talks on Ukraine have enabled Putin and Zelensky to meet for the first time But they have agreed only to kick the can down the road, to agree to disagree, while seeking progress on issues other than the war in Donbass It would be difficult to exaggerate the weakness of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky s position He is a political novice facing perhaps the most experienced and formidable statesman in the world Although an intelligent man, the former TV comediansayshe likes to do things quickly Russian President Vladimir Putin, by contrast, is known for his extreme attention to detail and for his propensity to play a very long game Putin is not in a rush Zelensky is, because time is not on Ukraine s side The country has avoided default by a whisker only by negotiating a new IMFloanto pay off the old one taken out five years ago and due for repayment this year The gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 is about to be completed, partly sidelining Ukraine as a transit country for European gas, thereby reducing both its political clout in Europe and, crucially, its revenue from transit fees Zelensnky needs a new agreement with Gazprom by the end of this year, i e in the next three weeks It isnot yetin the bag The worst development for Ukraine, however, is in the US Trump s enemies, who are seeking to impeach him over Ukraine, are above all horrified at what they thought was Trump s desire to stop arming the country When the director of European affairs at the US National Security Council, the Ukraine born Col Alexander Vindman, gave evidence to the House Intelligence Committee on November 19, hesaidthat he was shocked ù when he heard the phone call between presidents Trump and Zelensky But what shocked him was not the alleged quid pro quo Trump was asking for, dirt on Biden in return for aid, but instead his understanding that US policy on Ukraine was being abandoned READ MORE:US impeachment furor sabotages Ukraine peace talks Other Trump enemies have also made it clear that the specific reasons why they want to impeach Trump are but a cover for their main obsession, which is that the US should maintain its strong support for Ukraine and that there be no rapprochement with Russia and no revision of the Russiagate narrative This was, for instance, clear in Fiona Hill stestimony What this means for Zelensky is that Ukraine has become a political football in Washington It is at the heart of theimpeachmenthearings Whatever the outcome of that process, being pro Ukraine will henceforth mean being anti Trump and vice versa After more than two years of anti Russia hysteria by the Democrats, scepticism about Ukraine will inevitably rise among Republicans Support for Ukraine will no longer be bi partisan And since there is every likelihood Trump will survive impeachment and be re elected, Kiev only has two more years left If he wins a second term, Trump will be able to do whatever he likes, unimpeded by the machinations of the deep state ù praised for its opposition to Trump by theNew York Times All this explains why Zelensky got so little out of the Paris talks He was not able to discussCrimea, whose incorporation into Russia has therefore effectively been accepted by the EU He has accepted theSteinmeier formulawhich Ukrainian nationalistshatebecause it forces Ukraine to grant decentralized federal status to Donetsk and Lugansk And he has seen the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 confirmed and used as a basis for continuing discussions Although the Minsk agreements were long ago incorporated into a UN Security CouncilResolution, and are therefore very difficult to ignore, nationalists in Ukraine regard them as an agreement extorted from Ukraine under Russian military pressure On paper, therefore, Zelensky has not done well However, if prisoner exchanges continue, following the initial one in September; if there genuinely is aceasefireby the end of the year; and if Ukraine manages to renegotiate anything more than a one year deal on gas transit with Russia, then Zelensky will be seen as having brought home tangible benefits The concrete results are probably just as politically valuable to him as any hypothetical (but in reality improbable) comprehensive peace agreement Paradoxically, Zelensky has one strong point Putinlikeshim and wants him to succeed Moscow knows that Ukraine is bitterly divided between pro and anti Russian factions and that they take power one after the other The orangerevolution in 2004 lasted only 3 years before Viktor Yanukovich won parliamentary elections and became prime minister and then president The Maidan revolution has lasted 5 years but with the same result; the aggressively anti Russian party is out of power Given that Francewantsto put the Ukraine issue to bed in order to work with Russia on a host of other issues, that Angela Merkel isdeterminedto see the construction of North Stream 2 through to a successful conclusion, †and that Trump may well get a second term, Ukraine is looking politically fragile on the international stage, if not yet isolated If the Paris talks have told us one thing, it is that Zelensky s best friend, right now, is Putin Such are the ironies of international politics ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/475485-zelensky-putin-paris-peace-talks/
"9 Dec, 2019",How suddenly-precious cobalt that powers Teslas and iPhones also fuels child labor in Africa & armed heists in Europe,"It s an unwanted side effect of the world s growing desire for environmentally friendly vehicles: rare metals that are key components of electric cars are becoming prime targets for criminals, as demand sends their values soaring On a sunny July weekend in Rotterdam last year, a gang of men pull up in trucks at an unremarkable bonded warehouse situated among an industrial landscape of cranes, shipping containers and depots that sprawls 25 miles along the banks of Europe s biggest port Having purloined the secure codes that give them access through the warehouse s main gates, they make their way inside and head first to the building s security unit, punch in the number that disables the alarms and quickly remove the recording unit for the cameras that are aimed at the doors and windows Satisfied they are no longer being spied on, they head to a section towards the back of the warehouse and cut the padlock on its sliding door to reveal hundreds of orange and blue drums piled four high on pallets All are stuffed full with the prize the men are after: cobalt, a formerly obscure, unwanted metal that, thanks to the electric vehicle revolution, has become a highly desirable commodity nicknamed blue gold ù Five or six hours later, the last of the pallets stowed on board their trucks, the gang drives away with 112 tonnes of cobalt, worth around US$10 million The Dutch police who will investigate when the heist is discovered on the Monday morning spend months failing to catch anyone for the crime or recover any of the stolen goods Cobalt has become of particular interest to organised crime since its price rocketed by 250 percent between 2016 and 2018 (from about US$26,000 a tonne to more than US$90,000) thanks to demand from electric car manufacturers such as Tesla, Volvo, Ford and Volkswagen, and smartphone makers like Apple Its unique qualities prevent lithium ion batteries in mobiles and electric cars from overheating and going up in flames More than 50 percent of all cobalt demand is now for battery use, and the EU and the US both class it as a critical raw material As electric vehicle production gears up manufacturers worldwide are investing US$300 billion over the next few years so as to build 35 million electric cars and trucks annually by 2030 experts believe that the price of cobalt will rise again and make it even more attractive to criminals According to the prediction of one American cobalt investor: A wave of demand for copper, nickel, lithium and cobalt is coming that almost no one miner, investor or banker alike has anticipated or planned for ù The value of cobalt, which takes its name from the German kobold, or goblin ù, derives from its novel properties and relatively short supply It is an element that does not occur in a free form, but is gathered during the mining of copper or nickel and needs to be chemically prised from them using acids and heat For hundreds of years, it was used to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass or ceramics, but in the 20th century scientists discovered it to have qualities crucial to our most advanced technologies Combined with other metals, it produces alloys that are extremely strong, stable under high temperatures and anti corrosive for use in aircraft engines, rockets, nuclear power stations, turbines and cutting tools However, it is the demand created by its critical role in batteries for electric cars that is not only producing the unwanted attention of criminals, but is also fuelling a human rights crisis involving exploited child labour in one of the world s poorest countries in Africa Around 70 percent of the world s supplies come from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has been beset by decades of war, corruption and unrest The country is described as being to cobalt what Saudia Arabia is to oil Goldman Sachs, the merchant bank, has called cobalt the new gasoline Every day, tens of thousands of desperate Congolese, including children as young as four, illegally mine cobalt by hand in horrendous conditions Unicef estimates that there are 40,000 children working in mines across southern DRC, earning as little as 8p a day to crawl through discarded mines, some more than 100 meters deep, to scavenge for rocks containing cobalt in the discarded by products Reports from Amnesty International and others catalogue frequent injuries and deaths, prompting television and newspaper reports detailing the dreadful human cost Oneheadlinein a British newspaper states: Child miners aged four living a hell on Earth so you can drive an electric car ù Campaigners estimate that hundreds of miners die every year or have their health seriously damaged The hazards include mine collapses such asthe one in Junethis year that killed more than 40 miners working illegally on a site in Lualaba province in south east DR; asphyxiation due to inadequate ventilation; and illnesses such as the respiratory disease cobalt lung, a pneumonia which can cause permanent incapacity or death It s feared that thousands more children will be sucked into the hellish trade, particularly now that many countries have pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars between 2025 and 2040 Such damaging reports and headlines have forced companies like Apple, Tesla, Volkswagen and Volvo to try to find ways to ensure that the metal they buy is not conflict cobalt ù produced using child labour One avenue being explored is the use of blockchain technology, the cryptographic tech behind digital currencies like Bitcoin, to ensure traceability It may be difficult to enforce The rocks that the children find are sold on cheaply to traders, mostly Chinese middle men who, in turn, ship the cobalt back to their country to be made untraceable; it is smelted down before joining the supply chain that feeds the needs of giant multinationals, and whets the appetite of organised crime gangs in Europe Another cobalt heist occurred in 2012 down the coast in Antwerp Three containers of cobalt had been shipped to a warehouse at the Belgian port When truckers arrived to pick them up, they discovered that two had already been collected ù; thieves had once again somehow obtained the access codes used for deliveries Experts believe that the robberies are being carried out by organised crime gangs who not only know the docks well, but have extensive knowledge of the metal and understand the market for it Cobalt is not as fungible a commodity as many believe this makes it a difficult product to fence without a knowledgeable middleman with routes to market, ùsays George Heppel, a senior cobalt analyst at London based CRU group, which offers business intelligence on the metals and mining industries So what happens to the stolen cobalt? It is highly unlikely to have made its way into the battery supply chain, ùHeppel says My best guess is that it was probably sold into the alloy scrap and revert sector to be used in superalloys, speciality steels or diamond tools It s more likely to be in a jet engine than a smartphone ùBut whatever the use the black market that exists for scarce and valuable metals like cobalt is thriving Jan Struijs, the chairman of the Dutch police union and the former head of a criminal investigation squad in Rotterdam, told the business channel Bloomberg that the warehouse robbery there was simply the tip of the iceberg David Weight, the president of the UK based Cobalt Institute, says: If something is valuable then it becomes a target You saw it with copper: when its price was high, people were stealing manhole covers and pulling up electrical cables from the ground and some were killing themselves doing it When the price is high, people do the most extraordinary things ù By Richard Ellis, †freelance journalist in the UK ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/475370-cobalt-tesla-abuse-crime/

"31 Oct, 2019","US concerns over Nord Stream 2 are about fear of losing leverage, not welfare of Europe","As the Nord Stream 2 pipeline looms closer to completion, its panicked critics claim it will harm Ukraine and increase the EU s energy dependence on Russia which are, in fact, mutually exclusive arguments After years of delays, on Wednesday Denmark finally gave the approval for building a section of the pipeline inside its exclusive economic zone off the shore of Bornholm † With the receiving terminal in Germany well underway, this paves the way for the pipeline s completion by next year, only slightly behind schedule This is a geopolitical issue, this strengthens Russia and weakens Europe, ùUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Kiev on Thursday Not quite The pipeline strengthens Russia s economic position while it s Ukraine, not the EU, that ends up weakened politically Kiev, Washington, Warsaw and the Baltic States have tried just about everything to halt Nord Stream 2 s construction, citing a variety of arguments A perennial favorite is that the pipeline would increase Europe s dependency on Russian gas, while also depriving Ukraine of something like $3 billion in transit fees The trouble with these two arguments is that they are mutually contradictory If the EU were to forswear Russian gas entirely and replace it, say, with US liquefied natural gas (LNG), aka molecules of freedom ù Ukraine would lose the transit fees anyway Not that this is even remotely possible, because the US does not have the capacity to make up for 200 billion cubic meters a yearcoming infrom Russia Even if it could, it would be at the price point the Europeans could not afford Secondly, although Russia gradually reduces the amount of gas it pumps through Ukraine, it still accounted for about 87 billion cubic meters in 2018 That s in addition to about 55 billion cubic meters that are pumped on average through Nord Stream pipeline While Nord Stream 2 will be able to add another 55 billion, shutting off the valve to Kiev entirely would still reduce Moscow s gas exports The only way Europe s dependency ùwould increase is if the pipelines through Ukraine continue to run at full capacity which would mean Kiev would collect transit fees anyway Admittedly, those fees might have to be reduced somewhat, as Ukraine would lose its stranglehold on Russian gas exports which is the actual complaint of Kiev and Washington Simply put, Russia s ability to bypass Ukraine if needed greatly diminishes its geopolitical use to Washington and after the US spent billions on installing and supporting client regimes in Kiev not once, but twice in ten years Back in 2009, the orangerevolution ù government in Kiev diverted EU bound Russian gas to its own use, after Gazprom slashed deliveries due to delinquency This resulted in a total shut down of gas deliveries in the middle of January, during a cold snap no less Western media uniformly blamed Russia for the situation This standoff was the impetus for the construction of both Nord Streams and what would become the Turkish Stream The January 2009 gas crisis was only resolved when Kiev accepted a 10 year compromise deal That contract is set to expire at the end of 2019, and negotiations to extend it have not made much progress creating the prospect of a freezing Christmas in much of Europe, and making Nord Stream 2 look that much more attractive Time is running out before Russia completes the Nord Stream 2 project, further extending its malign economic influence over the NATO alliance The Senate must pass the Protecting Europe s Energy Security Act immediately https:// tdotco /uZBHFpJ8Q7 The US Congress has been threatening sanctions against anyone involved in the construction of both Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream, but has not followed through on the threats yet At this point, it is too late to stop the pipelines completion and the resulting loss of strategic leverage but that does not mean Washington is above doing something, out of sheer spite and frustration One thing should be clear, though: it will have nothing to do with the feigned concerns for the welfare and comfort of Europeans",https://www.rt.com/business/472341-nord-stream-us-leverage-concerns/

"5 Jul, 2019",Gangster mayors and oligarch‚Äôs dirty money: Will former criminals hold on to power in Ukraine?,"As Ukraine braces for an early parliamentary vote, its political elites are desperately looking for ways to forge alliances that would be of benefit in the new political environment Some deals, however, look shadier than others While Ukraine s major political parties led by former President Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are preparing to face off, as well as the newly formed party of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a parliamentary election, some political figures with a long criminal history also want a piece of the pie One of the leaders of the newlyformed Opposition Bloc who made it to the top of its election list, Gennady Trukhanov, appears to have a particularly gruesome criminal history behind him Since 2014, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odessa Ukraine s largest port and the third most populous city He is a political veteran who has been building his career in Ukraine s upper echelons of power for about a decade and a half Yet, his fine appearance hides the fact that he was once a member of a notorious gang which was allegedly involved in smuggling arms and drugs According to a 2018 BBCreport, the gang, which came into being in the 1990s, was linked to some particularly gruesome murders Trukhanov, who is involved in martial arts and has been thepresidentof the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation of Muay Thai since 2003, trained members of the gang in hand to hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons, ùthe BBC said, citing data from Italian police A reportcompiledby Italian law enforcement in the late 1990s names Trukhanov as one of the leaders of the gang who had extensive contacts with Ukrainian law enforcement He was also said to enjoy close ties with another gang leader a notorious crime lord called Aleksandr Angert, aka Sasha Angel Angert was sentenced to 15 years in prison for premeditated murder in 1980, but was released 10 years later as he was allegedly suffering from stomach cancer, which, however, apparently did not stop him from taking a leading role in another gang along with Trukhanov Later, Angert, one of Odessa s most influential crime lords, moved to London, where he has lived ever since and allegedly moved from crime to business, dissolving his gangs However, he reportedlyretainedhis close ties with his now business partner Trukhanov The criminal turned mayor, meanwhile, apparently did not wipe the slate clean after moving away from gang activities A 2016reportby the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), citing the Panama Papers, revealed that the mayor owns an entire business empire in Ukraine controlled through offshore firms registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is actively involved in embezzlement and money laundering Another Opposition Bloc leader who found his way to the top of the election list is Gennady Kernes, the longstanding mayor of Kharkov For about two decades, he has ruled over the nation s second most populous city (almost 1 5 million people), also a large industrial and science center He managed to retain his post through a range of political cataclysms, from the 2004 orangerevolution that brought Yushchenko to power, to the 2014 Maidan coup He has, however, a few skeletons in the closet According to an extensivereportpublished by an investigative media project called Criminal Ukraine , the now respectable mayor started his career in the 1990s as a fraudster, whose gang ran several shady schemes Eventually, they decided to expand ùtheir business ùand move from fraud to blackmail and extortion Kernes gang was even suspected of murder at one point, but those charges were apparently not proven Eventually, Kernes (nicknamed Gepa) was arrested, but only sentenced to three years in prison, and was set free two years later due to active repentance ùFollowing his release, the future mayor turned to privatization and managed to obtain quite a number of assets in Kharkov, including factories and real estate, through shady schemes, eventually emerging as a wealthy businessman ù Later, he allegedly used his influence to exert pressure on his political rivals and to gag journalists who dared to mention his criminal past in their reports Kharkov Region is located right next to the tumultuous Eastern Ukrainian regions, parts of which refused to recognize Kiev s authority following the 2014 Maidan coup and declared themselves the Donetsk and Lugansk People s Republics (DPR and LPR) As Kiev still struggles to regain control over the rebellious Donbass republics, having people like Kernes and Trukhanov at the helm of the regional governments will hardly give it much legitimacy in the eyes of the people there Other Ukrainian media reports suggest that Kernes enjoys close ties to controversial Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who is suspected by some of being the real puppet master behind Zelensky s recent landslide victory in the presidential election KernesvisitedKolomoisky in Israel ahead of the presidential runoff, according to one such report The billionaire dismissed the idea of any hidden agenda ùbehind the trip, telling the media that Kernes went to Israel for medical reasons ùand met him by coincidence Kolomoisky, an oligarch who made a fortune during the privatization frenzy in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, might yet turn out to be the one pulling the strings in the newly formed political bloc A sort of Ukrainian George Soros, Kolomoisky gained a reputation of being a shadowy figure seeking to influence politics Unlike Soros, he does not seem to have any particular ideological preference Instead, he apparently tries to place his millions on the winning horse Over the last decade and a half, he has supported the orangerevolution , former President Viktor Yushchenko, and then Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko He attained particular infamy in the wake of the Maidan coup, when he created his own paramilitary force bysponsoringanti Russia battalions Kolomoisky initially financed the notorious ultranationalist Azov Battalion for months in 2014 He is now reportedly one of the major backers of the Opposition Bloc He does not really hide this fact either In May, headmittedhe was consulting ùthe party created by Trukhanov and Kernes, which he called an All Ukrainian project ùHe also held talks with a leader of another party that eventually joined the bloc We have common issues The commercial and political ones, ùhe told Ukrainian Pravda back then, adding that some unsuccessful projects need a reboot ùThe billionaire specifically mentioned aligning ùforces and creating a broader ùagenda as a recipe for moving forward Kernes then rushed todownplaythe oligarch s influence on his party by saying that he neither financed nor consulted ùthe party, while calling his contacts with Kolomoisky a private matter ù As Zelensky s presidential victory clearly shows that Ukrainians have grown tired of the old political ways, tainted by corrupt elites linked to organized

"24 Jun, 2019","Cri-me-a-blues: Sanctimonious sanctions on Russia are damaging the EU, so why renew them?","Last week EU leaders extended economic sanctions on Russia in relation to events in Ukraine/Crimea Russia will no doubt reciprocate Both parties lose out, so why continue with them? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 Understand and not judge was the philosophy of the legendary Belgian crime writer Georges Simenon and it s his objectivity and lack of sanctimony which arguably makes his Inspector Maigret novels so refreshing to read in an age when everyone seems so opinionated and keen to virtue signal It s a pity that those behind the decision to extend some sanctions on Russia for another six months because of a lack of Minsk Agreements implementation ùand others for a further one year on account of Russia s annexation ùof Crimea, didn t read Simenon before they made their call Instead of applying common sense and doing what is best for European economies, EU leaders are doing the opposite to what Simenon recommended They are judging and not understanding The rationale behind the sanctions is punishment for Russia for annexing Crimea Which brings to mind another wise aphorism, this time from Friedrich Nietzsche: Mistrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful ù When it comes to the turmoil in Ukraine context is everything We re expected to see what s going on there only in close up, to zoom in on Russia s annexation of the Crimea and not see the bigger picture It is a simple truth that Crimea would not have been reclaimed by Russia, and there would have been no separatist movement in the east of Ukraine, had there been no regime change operation in 2014 to topple the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych The fragile post Soviet consensus that an independent Ukraine would neither tilt too far to the east to Russia, or to the west, which survived even the orangerevolution of 2004 5, was broken Ukraine would now be a de facto Western colony Just listen to the leaked tape recording of the US State Department s Victoria Nuland discussing with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, who should and shouldn t be in the new democratic government, if you still have any doubts Russia s use of Sevastopol as the home for its Black Sea fleet was in serious jeopardy and given the fact that hard core, Russian hating Ukrainian ultra nationalists were at the forefront of the regime change operation, Ukraine s Russian population had cause for concern too Given the events of February 2014, the reclaiming of Crimea by the Russian Federation, which was endorsed overwhelmingly by the Russian majority people of the province in a referendum, was entirely predictable and understandable In fact, it beggars belief that anyone would think the majority of Crimeans would want to stay tied to Kiev, given the political changes that had taken place This does not necessarily mean that we support what happened, only that we understand it Unfortunately the West s leaders in shaping their response took their cue not from the pipe smoking, non judgemental man of the world Inspector Maigret, but from Uriah Heep, the nauseating hand wringing hypocrite in Charles Dickens David Copperfield Heep is an affront not just because he is evil, but because he s society s fault Our fault He is the part of us that enjoys flattery, that likes to hear the word yes loud and often, and doesn t mind feeling superior to other people, ùwritesSam Jordison in his article on Heep from the Guardian in 2015 Russia s annexation of Crimea was a great crime, ùdeclared those who had actually supported far worse and far less justified annexations and invasions by other countries It s an incredible act of aggression, it really is a stunning willful choice by President Putin to invade another country, ùragedthen US Secretary of State John Kerry, conveniently forgetting that just over a decade earlier his own country had illegally invaded oil rich Iraq on the fraudulent grounds that it possessed WMDs One million people died following that incredible act of aggression ùyet for some Western virtue signalers, the relatively bloodless return of Crimea to Russia was a far more heinous action Have sanctions been imposed on the US and other countries, who invaded Iraq? Perish the thought! But we are supposed to back seemingly everlasting sanctions on Russia The costs of these sanctions have been extraordinary Last week at his Direct Line Q&A session with members of the public in Moscow, President Putin claimed that sanctions and the counter sanctions Russia had imposed, had cost the EU $240 billion since 2014 Russia itself had lost $50 billion If we go to Western sources, a report in October 2017 from the Austrian Institute of Economic Research found that Russian sanctions had cost EU countries 30 billion euro EU exports to Russia in 2013, the year before sanctions were introduced, were worth 120 billion euro, in 2016, they haddroppedto just 72 billion Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face We all know that Europe has come under great pressure from the US, which does far less trade with Russia, to keep the sanctions in place but shouldn t European leaders be putting their countries, their businesses and their people first? As to blaming Russia for a lack of Minsk agreements implementation, ùthe sanctions relating to Crimea were introduced before there were any Minsk agreements One suspects that goalpost moving is in operation here by those who are quite happy to see Europe and Russia continuing to take a big financial hit Georges Simenon would not be impressed by EU leaders going along with it Follow Neil Clark@NeilClark66 ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/462574-eu-russia-sanctions-ukraine/
"8 May, 2019",Trump Strangelove: Or how America learned to worry and hate Empire,"President Donald Trump seems to be making Americans hate the empire again, by embracing war or maybe only pretending to do so against Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea and who knows where else One thing to keep in mind about Trump is that his critics tend to instinctively oppose anything he is for, regardless of what they may have thought in the past Take this video, for example, comparing the eerily similar rhetoric behind George W Bush s push for war against Iraq and the Trump administration s current drumbeat for war with Iran, featuring Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Trump is pushing us toward the brink of war with Iran î and it all sounds alarmingly familiar pic twitter com/iLv7Rd8bXL The twist? It was produced by MoveOn org, a Democrat activist group set up in 1998 to oppose the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and bankrolled by George Soros These are the same Democrats, mind, who did nothing to oppose Clinton s 1999 war on Yugoslavia, Obama s 2011 intervention in Libya, or the actual Iraq War for that matter But now they warn against war with Iran because Orange Man Bad! Recall, however, that Trump himself has repeatedly denounced the Iraq War and indeed, used that to bludgeon Jeb Bush during the 2015 Republican primaries, obliterating the candidate the establishment and media thought would be the front runner Then, in 2016, Trump delivered a blisteringforeign policy speechdenouncing nation building and wars of conquest around the globe in favor of America first ù Oh, the establishment in Washington wailed and gnashed their teeth, but took comfort in the knowledge that Trump could never, ever possibly be elected Every single media outlet told them so, after all And then it happened anyway Netanyahu and Trump are gearing up for Bolton s mustache with Iran, and we re all screwed pic twitter com/PIpbvm5828 When the unthinkable happened later that year, the establishment launched every possible effort to resist ùand sabotage Trump s agenda, primarily by the means of the Russiagate conspiracy theory The very Swamp ùin Washington that Trump vowed to drain went to war against anyone who might actually do it from General Michael Flynn onward while steering clear of neocon cadres like Pompeo, Bolton,Kurt VolkerorElliott Abramsthat ended up working for Trump Have you seen any of them accosted at a restaurant, or accused of a scandal in the Washington Post? Of course not This is one possible explanation for why Trump ended up embracing the neocons: they are the only ones actually willing to work in his administration Another possibility, however, is that Trump is aware the very best way to make the establishment hate a position is for him to embrace it Justin Raimondo of Antiwar com, who has watched US foreign policy closely for the past 25 years, is convinced that Trump has embraced the neocons in order toset them upfor a defeat, letting Pompeo and Bolton along with others freely indulge their fantasies of regime change in Caracas or a counter revolution in Tehran, as a way to prove his point that the American Empire he condemned in 2016 is untenable We can see the knife go in as this whole scenario plays out, ùRaimondowrote in February, as Trump embraced regime change in Venezuela Perhaps that sounds a bit too Game of Thrones , but look at what has actually happened since: each attempt by US backed interim president Juan Guaido to take power has failed more spectacularly than the previous one Also note that one of the loudest voices for regime change in Venezuela and a harder line on Cuba, Senator Marco Rubio (R Florida) repaid Trump by voting against his declaration of emergency on the US Mexico border, invoked to overcome Democrat opposition to the border wall I do question Bolton and his motives, and I do NOT want any more wars I struggle with the fact that Trump has Bolton, a well known NeoCon, in this position https:// tdotco /d3g0dIcSOB Recall how the very same media outlets that hounded Trump with the now debunked Russiagate conspiracysang praisesto the beauty of our weapons ùwhen the president fired off some missiles into Syria, to ensure he stays the Assad must go ùcourse While the State Department rhetoric on that has not changed, Trump did order US troops out of Syria and that actually happened,more or less, suggesting that Washington has tacitly given up on regime change in Damascus Of course, this could all be Q level speculation about 4 D chess ùIt is entirely possible that Trump has simply been seduced by the neocon siren call of perpetual war and the American Empire, despite consistently expressed beliefs to the contrary over a long period of time If there is one thing that s been absolutely certain about the Trump presidency so far, it s that the only way to know for sure is to see what happens Nebojsa Malic, for RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/458688-trump-neocons-iran-venezuela/
"23 Apr, 2019",Is this man the puppet master of Ukraine‚Äôs new president or an overhyped bogeyman?,"It doesn t actually matter if Ukrainian Israeli billionaire Igor Kolomoisky is the real power behind Volodymyr Zelensky the president elect has to get rid of the oligarch if he is to make a break with the country s corrupt past The plots, deceits and conflicts of interest in Ukrainian politics are so transparent and hyperbolic, that to say that novice politician Zelensky was a prot√©g√© of his long time employer was not something that required months of local investigative journalism it was just out there Zelensky s comedy troupe has been on Kolomoisky s top rated channel for the past eight years, and his media asset spent every possible resource promoting the contender against incumbent Petro Poroshenko, a personal enemy of the tycoon, who hasn t even risked entering Ukraine in the past months Similarly, the millions and the nous needed to run a presidential campaign in a country of nearly 50 million people had to come from somewhere, and Kolomoisky s lieutenants were said to be in all key posts The two issued half hearted denials that one was a frontman for the other, insisting that they were business partners with a cordial working relationship, but voters had to take their word for it Now that the supposed scheme has paid off with Zelensky s spectacular victory in Sunday s run off, Ukrainian voters are asking: what does Kolomoisky want now, and will he be allowed to run the show? Born in 1963, in a family of two Jewish engineers, Kolomoisky is the type of businessman that was once the staple of the post Soviet public sphere, but represents a dying breed That is, he is not an entrepreneur in the established Western sense at all he did not go from a Soviet bloc apartment to Lake Geneva villas by inventing a new product, or even setting up an efficient business structure in an existing field Rather he is an opportunist who got wealthy by skilfully reading trends as the Soviet economy opened up selling Western made computers in the late 1980s and later when independent Ukraine transitioned to a market economy and Kolomoisky managed to get his hands on a large amount of privatisation vouchers that put many of the juiciest local metals and energy concerns into his hands, which he then modernised What he possesses is a chutzpah and unscrupulousness that is rare even among his peers Vladimir Putin once called him a one of a kind chancer ùwho managed to swindle [Chelsea owner] Roman Abramovich himself ùIn the perma chaos of Ukrainian law and politics, where all moves are always on the table, his tactical acumen has got him ahead Kolomoisky s lifeblood is connections and power rather than any pure profit on the balance sheet, though no one actually knows how that would read, as the Privat Group he part owns is reported to own over 100 businesses in dozens of Ukrainian spheres through a complex network of offshore companies and obscure intermediaries ( There is no Privat Group, it is a media confection, ù the oligarch himself says, straight faced )Unsurprisingly, he has been dabbling in politics for decades, particularly following the first orangerevolution in 2004 Though the vehicles for his support have not been noted for a particular ideological consistency in reportedly backing Viktor Yushchenko, then Yulia Tymoshenko, he was merely putting his millions on what he thought would be a winning horse But at some point in the post Maidan euphoria, Kolomoisky s narcissism got the better of him, and he accepted a post as the governor of his home region of Dnepropetrovsk, in 2014 The qualities that might have made him a tolerable rogue on TV, began to grate in a more official role From his penchant for using the political arena to settle his business disputes, to creating his own paramilitary force by sponsoring anti Russian battalions out of his own pocket, to his somewhat charmless habit of grilling and threatening to put in prison those less powerful than him in fits of pique ( You wait for me out here like a wife for a cheating husband, ù begins a viral expletive strewn rant against an overwhelmed Radio Free Europe reporter) There is a temptation here for a comparison with a Donald Trump given a developing country to play with, but for all of the shenanigans, his ideological views have always been relatively straightforward Despite his Russia loathing patriotism, not even his fans know what Kolomoisky stands for The oligarch fell out with fellow billionaire Poroshenko in early 2015, following a battle over the control of a large oil transport company between the state and the governor The following year, his Privat Bank, which at one point handled one in four financial transactions in the country was nationalized, though the government said that Kolomoisky had turned it into a mere shell by giving $5 billion of its savings to Privat Group companies Other significant assets were seized, the government took to London to launch a case against his international companies, and though never banished, Kolomoisky himself decided it would be safer if he spent as long as necessary jetting between his adopted homes in Switzerland and Tel Aviv, with the occasional trip to London for the foreseeable future But the adventurer falls and rises again The London case has been dropped due to lack of jurisdiction, and only last week a ruling came shockingly overturning the three year old nationalization of Privat Bank Smiling to himself, Kolomoisky would be within his rights to think that he has never had it so good Zelensky must disabuse him of that notion It doesn t matter that they are friends Or what handshake agreements they made beforehand Or that he travelled to Geneva and Tel Aviv 13 times in the past two years Or what kompromat Kolomoisky may or may not have on him It doesn t matter that his head of security is the man who, for years, guarded the oligarch, and that he may quite genuinely fear for his own safety (it s not like nothing bad has ever happened to Ukrainian presidents) Volodymyr Zelensky is now the leader of a large country, with the backing of 13 5 million voters It is to them that he promised a break with past bribery, graft and cronyism Even by tolerating one man and one who makes Poroshenko look wholesome next to him, he discredits all of that He will have the support of the people if he pits himself against the puppet master no one would have elected Kolomoisky in his stead Whether the oligarch is told to stay away, whether Ukraine enables the financial fraud investigation into him that has been opened by the FBI, or if he is just treated to the letter of the law, all will be good enough This is the first and main test, and millions who were prepared to accept the legal fiction of the independent candidate two months ago, will now want to see reality to match Zelensky s TV president protagonist in Servant of the People also broadcast by Kolomoisky s channel, obviously, would never have compromised like that What hinges on this is not just the fate of Zelensky s presidency, but the chance for Ukraine to restore battered faith in its democracy shaken by a succession of compromised failures at the helm Igor Ogorodnev

"24 Jan, 2019",Trump's coronation of Guaido as Venezuelan president - Al Capone redux,"Scour the history books and you will struggle to find an act of imperialism more brazen than US President Donald Trump s de recognition of Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela s president In a scathingdenouncementof theMexican American Warof 1846 48, famed US Civil War General (and later president) Ulysses S Grant told a reporter, We had no claim on Mexico Texas had no claim beyond the Nueces River, and yet we pushed on to the Rio Grande and crossed it I am always ashamed of my country when I think of that invasion ù The Mexican American War was a war of plunder and conquest on the part of a US ruling class for whom every country south of the Rio Grande was then, as if by divine right, deemed subservient to Washington From then to now the US has regarded Latin America as a wholly owned subsidiary, its primary function to serve Washington s economic interests Any Latin American government that dared assert its country s right to sovereign independence of the US in the years since has found itself subjected to a campaign of subversion and attack, so blatant in gangsterism it would have made Al Capone blush It was US Marine GeneralSmedley Butlerwho famously said after retiring in 1931: I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914 I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street ù This is the context in which Trump s publicrecognitionof Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaido, as interim president should be weighed Starting from the beginning, ever since Hugo Chavez dared liberate Venezuela from the iron grip of a US controlled local oligarchy in the late 1990s, Washington has engaged in a concerted and unrelenting effort to return the oil rich country to its rightful status as a wholly owned subsidiary And what with Venezuela possessing the largest proven oil reserves in the world, for a Trump administration that evinces the characteristics of a New York mafia crime family more than a democratic government, it was always inevitable that this campaign would be ramped up rather than tamped down upon the Orange One s arrival in the White House in 2016 Venezuela s current legally elected president, Nicolas Maduro, took over the presidency after his mentor s death from cancer in 2013, pledging to protect and continue the legacy of radical reforms Chavez inspired and introduced And under the aegis of the Bolivarian Constitution, the achievements of those reforms cannot be gainsaid The mass literacy known asMission Robinsonwas the biggest and most ambitious ever undertaken, its successrecognizedby UNESCO in 2005 when it declared Venezuela illiteracy free Cuba, crucial to that success, was also involved in the establishment of health clinics, designed to provide free healthcare to the country s poor Additionally, according to the UN, the quality of life of Venezuelansimprovedat the third highest rate in the world between 2006 11 Poverty was cut from 48 6 percent in 2002 to 29 5 percent by 2011, while at the time of Chavez s death Venezuela had the lowest rate of income inequality of any country in Latin America In order to achieve such outstanding outcomes, the Chavez government moved against the country s US backed oligarchy, seizing the assets of over 1,000 companies It also nationalized oil fields owned by US oil giants Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips Price controls were introduced in order to ensure the affordability of basic necessities, which along with free education, healthcare and the constitutional right to a home ensured that the Bolivarian Revolution was a beacon of hope to the poor and marginalized not just in Venezuela but throughout the region and across the wider Global South On foreign policy, meanwhile, Chavez proved a formidable foe of US hegemony, taking every opportunity to denounce the history of Washington s role in subverting democracy, human rights and national sovereignty throughout Latin America, educating the Venezuelan people on the history of US imperialism in the process He sought and forged closer ties with Cuba, China, Russia and Iran countries that likewise opposed and challenged US domination and embarked on numerous initiatives throughout the region to foment closer economic, political and cultural integration This fruits of this policy were the establishment of the Latin American trading bloc known asMercosur, the economic, political and cultural integrationist project knows as ALBA, and the pan Latin American television and media network,Telesur Prior to his death, Chavez also had ambitions to set up a regional development bank in order to end dependence on the IMF and World Bank The legacy laid out above is important to grasp if serious about understanding why for Washington the Venezuela shaped and inspired by Hugo Chavez could never be allowed to survive Since assuming office in 2013, Maduro has had to contend with a sharp drop in the price of oil, which, combined with a determined campaign conducted by a US supported opposition, plus US sanctions, has plunged the country into a deepening economic, social and political crisis The result has been skyrocketing inflation and a shortage of basic goods on supermarket shelves, blamed by Maduro on an orchestrated policy by the opposition of hoarding food supplies in order to foment social unrest Now, with the crisis in the country reaching the point of critical mass, Trump s coronation of Juan Guaido as interim president marks the next and most blatant attack on a Bolivarian Revolution whose only crime, since inception, has been the crime of a good example ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/449554-trumps-coronation-guaido-venezuela/

Once again, celebrities and late night show hosts are beseeching their fans to vote, while newspapers pen fawning pieces about Democrats making history, ùthe inevitability of the Blue Wave, ùand theracist, racist, RACISTnature of every Republican ever, especially Trump Vote like the authoritarian president is a racist sexual predator who colluded with Russia and won t show his taxes and violates the emoluments clause and incites nazi terrorism but the GOP is complicit and the media is distracted so it s up to us to save the god damn country The only thing that has changed is that most media outlets which had overwhelmingly endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 don t even bother hiding their preferences Everything is out in the open now, stripped of all pretense and posturing Ironically, that is one of the effects of the Trump presidency Much like the armies that are always studying how to re fight the last war, US politicians appear to be obsessed with re fighting the last election Both major parties see the 2018 midterms as a rematch of 2016, but for different reasons Democrats are hoping that Trump s victory was a fluke, a glitch in the matrix, and that their inevitable march to power will be put back on track Trump s Republicans, however, believe that 2016 was a revolution in political affairs and that their tactics will work once again The most important election ever ùis a worn out cliche, but these midterms are not your usual election That s evidenced by thesheer amount of moneyspent on them, a record $5 billion Yet it is worth recalling that in 2016, Clinton both outraised and outspent Trump, to no avail They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing, ùis a quote attributed to a famous diplomat from over 200 years ago, about a French royal dynasty It applies just as well to the American political dynasties the Clintons and the Bushes and their coteries, deposed by Trump in 2016 What they did not realize then, and do not appear to realize even now, is that their tried and tested tricks simply didn t work against Trump, who is not a professional politician and doesn t react like one Love him or hate him, agree with his policies or not, this is a fact Rather than recognize that fact and deal with it accordingly, Trump s critics just stuffed more wool into their ears and continued screaming RACIST, ùas if that invocation was somehow magical It is this sort of magical thinking that doomed the Democrats in 2016 It wasn t just bad data, or a terrible job interpreting it, but the fact that both the media and the Clinton campaign wanted to believe their own hype Instead of reporting reality, the media thought they couldcreateit So they pretended the railroading of Bernie Sanders did not happen, and confidently predicted Clinton would crush Trump Then came the night of November 8 and the shocked, stunned long faces in TV studios and at the Javits Center That right there was the perfect moment for self reflection, understanding what went wrong and where, and learning from it Instead, Clinton blamed Russia, and the media quickly followed suit The alternative would have been admitting they had made a mistake, after all Today, they argue that history shows the ruling party always loses the first midterms Fair enough, but history also shows the incumbent party going strong when the economy is good and by the standards accepted by the media, that s observably the case So what we get are headlines along the lines of Economy has never been better; This is why it s bad and also Trump s fault ù Remember it was Hillary Clinton who first used the phrase fake news ù?

since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv If you re not Russian, you probably haven t heard of Aleksey Pushkov He s an influential academic, politician, and media personality who once ran the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Duma (the lower house of the parliament) and is widely considered to be close to the Kremlin In the early hours of Monday morning, as the extent of Vladimir Putin s latest presidential victory became clear, he took to Twitter to make a very important point: western demonization of Putin inspires the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this ù Influential Russian politician & commentator Alexei Pushkov says western demonization of Putin causes the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this https:// tdotco /IPgDfW8Zsb Pushkov is correct Because Putin s latest landslide was partially made in the West To understand why, we need to rewind the clock to 2011 Back then, on the surface at least, Russia was doing well economically The ruble was trading around 30 to the US dollar and the price of oil was high While the country s reliance on the latter resource was always a poor long term strategy, it provided easy money And this meant Russians could afford to travel to places, and buy imported products, which Soviet citizens could only have dreamed of, two decades earlier Despite this, a considerable amount of people weren t happy And when the sitting president, Dmitry Medvedev, announced in September that he was stepping aside to support Putin s (who was serving as prime minister) return to the Kremlin, anger grew in some sections of society, especially the pro business and liberal factions You see, for them, Medvedev represented the promise of liberalization and westernization, and the return of Putin was seen as a step backwards towards nationalism, conservatism, and even authoritarianism In December, the Duma election took place, with United Russia, the party associated with Putin and Medvedev, failing to win a majority of the vote Some alleged the contest had been falsified and the party s real share was even smaller READ MORE:America s elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world As a result, protests kicked off, largely centered in Moscow But there were also demonstrations in many provincial cities, including Khabarovsk, more than 8,000km from Moscow, where I resided at the time At this moment, one thing was very clear: many Russians sought a new sense of identity, and the various post Soviet factions were heading for a showdown One which took place over the following months In December, the Western media had decided to christen the unrest as the Snow Revolution , amemewhich conjured memories of similar events in Ukraine and Georgia, labelled Orange and Rose respectively And this was a serious error because Russians weren t looking for the overthrow of their state And, at least in the heartland, many feared a return to the anarchy of the 1990s Thus, while certain capital city circles sizzled with talk of revolution, where I was living, people seemed horrified by the very idea This is the rich Moscow elite marching, these guys have nothing in common with me, ù was a typical statement While others seemed to think the protestors were ungrateful, because, after all, their very prosperity was mostly down to Putin, who had inherited a basket case economy in 2000 and greatly improved living standards Nevertheless, things became very tense for a while, with no less a figure than Mikhail Gorbachev publiclycallingfor Putin to resign † Of course, Putin didn t heed Gorby s call Instead, he continued his presidential campaign and in March 2012, won handsomely, with a score of 63% nationally, but only 46% in Moscow Now, this is where I need to explain something: the 2011/12 protests were, more or less, a big smoke ù phenomenon And it explains † why Western media correspondents, who are all based in Moscow and have little understanding of the rest of Russia, beyond itsoccasionalnovelty value, made their readers and viewers believe something substantial was stirring when the reality was less dramatic Because, in a place like Khabarovsk, the movement gained no traction beyond a bit of muttering in cafes and between close family and friends Putin realized this and learned a lesson In his first two terms, he d probably spent too much time worrying about the Moscow elite From now on, he was going to focus on his base, the ordinary folk who keep Russia working And little did he know at the time, but the West was about to lend a helping hand The KremlinbelievedHillary Clinton had interfered in Russia s 2011/12 unrest, but her influence was limited, even if Putin s team regarded it as a betrayal However, America s behavior in Ukraine in 2013/14 was another matter entirely This was the US openly intervening in street protests in Russia s neighbor and Clinton s former assistant secretary of state,Victoria Nuland, was leading the charge eventually even going so far aschoosinga new government in the aftermath For Russians, it was incredible Ukraine, home to entire regions where ethnic Russians constitute a significant majority, was, as they saw it, being destabilized in a Western backed coup Something which meant that Crimea, part of Russia for hundreds of years until Nikita Khrushchev signed it away in the 1950s, could have feasibly wound up housing NATO bases Thus, when Putin decided to reabsorb the peninsula in the spring of 2014, his popularity ratings reached unprecedented levels Because Russians believed the West had betrayed them And, since then, the EU and the US have played into his hands Russians are fully aware of Western scaremongering about their country and the demonization of their president They see it on news sites, across social media, and on TV And the ones who can t understand English can even read Russian translations of the Western press on a dedicated website, Inosmi (which, incidentally, is state funded) Furthermore, in addition to the constant barrage of media delirium, the NATO countries sanctions policy has created a besieged fortress mentality in Russia Indeed, Andrey Kondrashov, Putin s campaign spokesman, summed this up on Sunday night Turnout is higher than we expected, by about 8 10 percent, for which we must say thanks to Great Britain, ù hesaidwith tongue surely in cheek, referring to the fallout from a spy poisoning drama in the UK We were pressured exactly at the moment when we needed to mobilize [voters] Whenever Russia is accused of something indiscriminately and without any evidence, the Russian people unite around the center of power And the center of power is certainly Putin today ù In 2012, Putin was under pressure in Moscow, but this weekend he secured over 70% of the vote in thecapital And in St Petersburg, where he managed 58% six years ago, he can now boast a 75% score And it has happened at a time when Russians have endured a deep recession, with falling real wages, during a painful, but necessary, economic restructuring after the previous resource driven model exhausted itself Today, even liberal, educated, and cosmopolitan dwellers of the two big cities generally support the status of Crimea and now resent the West for its anti Russia hysteria Whereas in 2011 12, many saw the US as a country to aspire to, now they are disappointed with Washington and believe the US to be fundamentally opposed to respecting any of Russia s vital interests READ MORE:Putin s landslide victory to attract additional $30bn to Russian economy Thus, ironically, a Western policy aimed at weakening Putin and reducing Russian resolve has completely backfired Eighteen years after he first entered the Kremlin, the president s position has never been stronger, or more secure And he can thank the dysfunctional and self destructive policy of the United States and the European Union A lot of which is influenced

"5 Oct, 2017","October 5, 2000: Flashback to Yugoslavia, West's first color revolution victim","While Washington makes evidence free claims of Russian interference in US politics, it is worth remembering an epidemic of colorrevolution s ù around the world openly sponsored by the US, which began in Serbia 17 years ago October 5, 2000 now seems a lifetime ago It is worth reaching that far back in the memory to the first colorrevolution , ùa technique developed to overthrow governments Washington disliked and replace them with more favorable and compliant ones According to the official narrative crafted by the Western media and their franchises in Serbia, the righteous people revolted against the corrupt, dictatorial regime of Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets of Belgrade, stormed the public TV station and the parliament, and established freedom and democracy without bloodshed There is just one problem None of it is true The US had long tried to replace Milosevic with someone more willing to obey unconditionally and remake what was then still Yugoslavia into yet another eastern European country that was transitioned ùfrom Communism and despoiled in the process Previous attempts at doing so, from the 1995 intervention in Bosnia to the1999 NATO attackand occupation of Kosovo, had failed After Milosevic held out against the alliance for 78 days and eventually struck a negotiated armistice, agents of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros Open Society Fund, USAID and other quasi NGOs answering to Washington stepped up plans for regime change by other means US Ambassador Richard Miles midwifed ù the creation of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a hodgepodge of small parties centered on the Democrats The party s leader, Zoran Dindic, was kept in the shadows since he polled in single digits Instead, the coalition s public face was Vojislav Kostunica, a mild mannered law professor with no political baggage, picked as the best candidate against Milosevic in the September 24 presidential election Meanwhile, a student movement called Otpor (Resistance) was quickly taken over by US trained activists, like Srda Popovic Training sessions in Hungary, run by NED contractors instructed Otpor activists, taught participants how to ridicule, disrupt and attack the government through civil disobedience Suitcases of cash ù smuggled across the border paid for posters, placards, t shirts, street art and other branding, all featuring the iconic fist logo Another key NGO funded from the West was the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), a self appointed vote watchdog whose claims directly contradicted the official electoral commission After the government announced that neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote and a runoff would be required, DOS and Otpor called for a general strike and mass street protests on October 5 Protesters stormed the Yugoslav Parliament and torched the ballot boxes stored there, conveniently obliterating any evidence of who might have actually won the election After meeting with Kostunica, Milosevic agreed to step down peacefully, robbing the rebels of some of their momentum As a result, ƒêindic was unable to implement the full revolutionary agenda, with Kostunica objecting to his trampling of the laws in the name of reformist ù expediency Ever since then, however, who ruled Serbia has never really been decided at the ballot box but at the US embassy, with either pre or post electoral alliances or cynical schemes to manipulate the parliamentary majority Most recently, in 2012, leaders of the Radical Party re branded themselves as the Progressives to get the US blessing to take over and went on to deliver most of Washington s demands when it came to giving up the occupied province of Kosovo, among other things None of this really mattered to the revolution s backers; they only wanted a vassal regime in Belgrade, the actual rule of law, democracy or human rights in Serbia be damned They also decided the October 5 formula was too good to be used just once and set out to deploy it elsewhere Ambassador Miles oversaw the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, installing in power the US educated Mikhail Saakashvili This, too, proved detrimental to the country s actual inhabitants: Saakashvili started the August 2008 war with Russia, lost the war, and the 2012 election, and fled the country before he could be arrested for corruption He later joined the US backed government in Ukraine, but that s another story In 2004, the US sponsored the orangerevolution in Kiev, backing a DOS like coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko By that point, Washington wasn t even pretending to be uninvolved US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev, ran a Guardian headline from November 26, 2004, talking about the role of Miles in Georgia and his colleague Michael Kozak in Belarus The operation engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people s elections, wrote the Guardian s Ian Traynor, noting that the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 ù A decade later, colorrevolution techniques would once again be used in Ukraine, culminating in the February 2014 coup against President Viktor Yanukovich and the subsequent crisis in Crimea and the Donbass The manual for this kind of coup waswrittenby US scholar Gene Sharp But it was the former Otpor activists who spread it across the world In 2004, Popovic founded CANVAS (Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) and began traveling the world peddling his revolutionary methods to whoever was Uncle Sam s next target A 2011 documentary about the revolution business followed Otpor/CANVAS activity to North Africa during that year s Arab Spring uprisings Wherever they go, these agents of chaos infect the target country s politics, manipulating genuine local activists into becoming the agents of their people s demise While they preach democracy, their dirty tricks are effectively destroying its credibility in the long term That s fine with them, however; the objective is not democracy but obedience Besides, they won t stick around to see the consequences there is always the next revolution to plan and execute And they always mobilize the young, known for their excess of emotion and shortage of wisdom They sing the seductive song of bringing down a dictator ù(there s even a documentary! With a celebrity narrator!) to people who think that will solve all of their problems Before the dust from the revolution clears, however, the CANVAS consultants have moved off to the next target, leaving their duped students to watch in horror as their countries descend into strife or chaos If they are extremely lucky, they end up replacing one corrupt regime with another, only this time beholden to foreign masters While the colorrevolution s are not always successful, even the failed ones cause severe damage to the target country s politics Also, once infected, a country is always in danger of relapse Popovic was most recently sighted in Hungary, at the beginning of September, amid growing protests against that country s stubbornly independent government that eerily resemble the blueprint established in Serbia, 17 years ago Nebojsa Malic for RT",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/405771-october-2000-remembering-yugoslavia-nato/

Democratic National Committee met with top officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort, and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation, ùthe piece continued The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia ù And here was the zinger: Politico s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections ù Later, Politicofocusedon the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American activist, who admitted acting as a link between Ukraine s Washington Embassy and the Democratic National Committee And also how Sergei Leshchenko, elected in 2014 as an MP for Poroshenko s party, had offered ledgers purportedly showing connections between Trump and Manafort before urging Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort ùIncidentally, Manafort has always been especially appalled at attempts to link his work to Russia, saying all my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West ù Leschenko wasn t coy about his intentions He openly admitted trying toexposeTrump as a pro Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world, ùby preferring Moscow to Ukraine Furthermore, as The Atlantic noted: the investigation into the payments listed in the ledger îwhich in April were partially corroborated by theAPthrough wire transfers that Manafort claimed were legitimate îmysteriously faded after the U S election, raising questions about whether Ukrainian officials aired concerns about Manafort less to root out corruption than to undermine the Trump campaign ù Overall, Democrat Ukraine collusion seems far deeper than anything so far proven between the Trump campaign and Russia For instance, Donald Jr stands exposed as having been willing to meet someone described as affiliated with the Kremlin to get information on Hillary, which was pretty dumb The meeting itself appeared to be a bait and switch so the lawyer could lobby on other matters However, the Ukraine story involved a concerted and deliberate campaign, including cooperation between Kiev representatives and the Clinton camp to research Trump Kremlin connections Thus, If the issue is collusion, it s obvious there was much greater connivance concerning Ukraine and the Democrats than a single exchange involving Donald Jr and an insignificant lawyer One where no information was actually provided That said, American outrage over meddling from Kiev and Moscow is laughable in the context of Washington s long history of interference in both countries politics In 1996, the US openly intervened in Russia s election to help Boris Yeltsin defeat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov And in 2011, Washington officials, including Clinton, publicly supported a protest campaign over disputed parliamentary elections The following year,Michael McFaularrived as ambassador to Moscow and unabashedly courted fringe opposition leaders in his very first event in the role In Ukraine, the interruptions have had even more serious consequences By the admission of Victoria Nuland, a member of the Obama administration, Washington spent over$5 billionon influence projects in the country The first regime change ùoperation came in 2004 and was known as the orangerevolution ùAnd in 2013, US politicians and officials, such as John McCain and Nuland herself, turned up in Kiev to encourage the Maidan movement, in which the USambassadorGeoffrey Pyatt was prominent That led to the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government, which divided the country and caused the separation of Crimea and a civil war in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions And it also contributed to an economic collapse which has seen the average Ukrainian salary fall to around $200 a month and led to unprecedented levels of emigration For sure, Ukrainians didn t hide their hostility toTrump Interior Minister Arsen Avakov deriding the eventual winner as a dangerous marginal ùanddescribinghim as a clown ùon Twitter Many Russians publicly slammed Clinton, which was hardly surprising after shecomparedVladimir Putin to Hitler The fact remains there is no evidence of a direct Kremlin campaign to undermine America s election The media has

ù And it now appears they might be onto something because the failed diplomat is showing signs of the kind of delirium which is often a telltale sign of slumber deprivation His latest brain fart is truly astonishing Amazingly, McFaul has taken to the pages of the increasingly hysterical and McCarthyist Washington Post to suggest how employees of RT should be classed as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ù He s stuck a question mark on the end, to leave himself some wriggle room But even the snake like punctuation symbol is no stumper here I dont know the truth about foreign involvement in our elections I want the American people to know #FactsMatter https:// tdotco /uLjcKjSyHX McFaul should, and certainly does, know better And his Twitter praise of RT s chief editor, Margarita Simonyan, for her fantastic job in the service of the Russian state ù is further proof of the duplicitous strategy at play here Because it s clear how these attempts to install a narrative that RT is solely serving the Kremlin, are designed to leave American staff of this network in an impossible position Despite the gormless veneer, the shameless professor is playing a shrewd game One old Joe McCarthy himself would have greeted with relish As there s no mention of similarly †foreign state funded outlets like BBC, Al Jazeera or France 24, all of which also operate in the US, it s clear how the target is to scare American journalists away from working for RT Now, while it may be water off a duck s back to a veteran like Larry King, it has serious implications for a young reporter Not to mention, the repercussions for Russian citizens employed by Western news organizations You see, the US has its own version of RT, called Voice of America and its own Sputnik too, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Both of these began life as CIA cut outs, and they continue to be generously funded Indeed their parent, the BBG, has a budget around three times larger than RT Oh, and if you ve never heard of them, don t despair because you really aren t missing much But it might be worth looking at their charter, which insists they must be consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States Obviously, any attempt to restrict Russian media s freedom to operate in America would have knock on consequences for US equivalents here And from speaking to Kremlin officials, it s clear how it could also extend to private broadcasters and publications, given the imbalance in penetration In the sense that, while almost every major US entity has a Moscow correspondent, the inverse is not the same Thus, it s clear how this insensitive and dunderheaded punditry can make a lot of honest professionals feel very insecure Another problem with McFaul s supposition is where he attempts to convince readers how RT campaigned openly for one candidate, Donald Trump ù Put plainly; this is nonsense Because if the network was guilty of favoring a US politician in recent times, it s probably Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders, both of whom engaged with the channel frequently As did their supporters Also, on a personal note, I talk to RT employees very often, and none have exhibited any profound delectation over Trump s success, but quite a few expressed a fondness for Bernie All this is important in the context of an article headed let s get the facts right ù So is the manner in which McFaul informs us how we know that Russian actors stole data from people working at the Democratic National Committee ù But we don t know ù if it s true And McFaul provides no evidence for it Even ignoring how WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange has clearly stated how he didn t obtain the DNC files from Russian sources As a result, it s reasonably likely that the entire column is based on some dreaded fake news ù And this is certainly not something to be singing an aria about And you d think McFaul would have learned his lesson on making stuff up after WaPo used his comments to stand up the infamous PropOrNot ù piece which smeared around 200 media outlets as being agents of Russian influence?

"7 Mar, 2016",How EU & NATO exploited Ukraine to serve their own geopolitical goals," Ukraine will definitely not be able to become a member of the EU in the next 20 to 25 years, and not of NATO either Let s play a guessing game Who made this statement last week? Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Was it: (a) Vladimir Putin(b) Sergey Lavrov(c) Viktor Yanukovich(d) Jean Claude Juncker If the correct answer were (a) or (b), western journalists and pro Kiev regime activists which are frequently indistinguishable would be lining up to dismiss the quote as Russian propaganda ù Or Hybrid War ù Or whatever this month s agreed catchphrase/Twitter hashtag is As it happens, Russia has been consistent on one particular point since Kiev s orangerevolution , back in 2004 that the US s primary objective is to exploit Ukraine s fratricidal divisions to serve its own geopolitical goals Which Moscow believes are to pushAmerican forcesas close to Russia s borders as possible, in the name of containment Two things have prevented this plan from fully succeeding Firstly Ukraine s internal conflicts Capital city protestors, aided by Galician allies, have now removed two eastern dominated governments The second of which was fairly elected As sentiment in Kiev and Lviv doesn t reflect the entire country, the regimes these demonstrations created have been unable to consolidate popular, nationwide, support For example, current President Petro Poroshenko, now enjoys lowerapproval ratingsthan his ousted predecessor, Viktor Yanukovich, had before Maidan The other barrier has been many NATO and EU members reluctance to countenance full Ukrainian membership of their institutions Thus, Ukraine is drip fed with aid, and warm words of praise, while getting no closer to joining either club It s instructive to note that NATO is more than willing to supplymilitary assistanceand funding to Ukraine, but, despite heavy lobbying from the likes of Bernard HenriLevy, a Marshall plan esque economic strategy remains unfathomable to western leaders We hear plenty of, often bellicose, Washington solidarity with Ukraine s army, but very little about its pensioners, who are expected tosurviveon average payments of just $14 07 a week, at current exchange rates This compares to $40 51 inBulgariaand $41 25 inRussia, where utilities are significantly cheaper A guess at (c) would also be incorrect Yanukovich might have been a terribly corrupt and weak President, but, back in 2013, he did, belatedly, realize one thing: the EU association agreement, which he pulled back from signing, would become an unmitigated disaster for Ukraine That s because it involved sacrificing ties with the country s biggest trading partner, Russia, and replacing them with a far less certain alternative Free trade with the EU is largely useless to Ukraine, as things stand For the past two decades, the country s ruling classes have stolen everything they could, and moved that moneyabroad As a consequence, there has been little or no investment in modernizing Ukrainian industry That means its products are of insufficient quality to compete in cutthroat European markets Confusingly, many activists at Maidan seemed to believe that EU accession was on the cards for Ukraine It never was A free trade pact, heavily loaded in Brussel s favor, was all that was available By contrast, Russia offered$15 billionand a 30% discount on gas This was in response to an IMF demand that Ukraine raise utility prices and slash public spending in return for a bail out Post coup, Ukraine was forced into the latter scenario by default Since then, nominal GDP hasfallenfrom $183 billion to around $90 billion Meanwhile, public debt was 94% of GDP in 2015 and annual salaries now average about $2,000, the lowest in Europe On January 1st, foreign reserves stood at a meagre $12 5 billion You re surely guessed by now that (d) Jean Claude Juncker is our man The President of the EU Commission wasspeakingin the Netherlands, where a referendum on the EU Ukraine free trade agreement will be held in April While trying to assuage the fears of Dutch voters about more, unpopular, easterly EU expansion, he let the cat out of the bag about where Ukraine stands with Eurocrats In the heady days of late 2013, EU leaders, like the ultimately deposed, pro Americanpairof Carl Bildt and Radoslaw Sikorski,gaveMaidan protestors the impression that Brussels was open to Ukrainianmembership Even now, Kiev has NGOs devoted to EU integration and we ve heard endless talk of Ukraine s † European choice ù As an aside, given that the EU only controls 44% of the continent s land area, it s endlessly amusing when activists say Europe when theymean the EU Juncker s words, though an example of rare sincerity from a Eurocrat, are a kick in the teeth to Kiev s EU integrationists While he s merely confirming what smart analysts have already known for a long time, the fact that someone of his stature is openly dismissing Ukrainian ambitions is highly significant The EU Commission President acknowledged that the EU had enlarged too quickly in the past and insisted Brussels will not make that mistake again ù Interestingly, it could be argued that the haste to admit Romania and Bulgaria back in 2007, and the British media reaction to it, created the circumstances for this year s Brexit vote For that reason, the behavior of the UK authorities during Maidan was always quite amusing We ve seen Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond promote the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, while simultaneously admitting he dvoteto remove his own country from Brussel s orbit The hypocrisy is mind blowing Ukrainians are living under the illusion that their country is on the road to EU membership and acceptance into the western political and economic system To achieve these aspirations, they are enduring great sacrifices The problem is that the EU elite doesn t want Ukraine to join the club It s too big, too corrupt, too poor and too close to Russia It s time Kiev s legislative, and oligarchic, elite told their people the truth Ukraine s European choice is a fraud, built on false promises The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT

"3 Mar, 2016",US defense establishment believes Putin must be 'defeated',"Certain people in America s defense establishment believe that only governments that do Washington s bidding are truly legitimate ù Others have ideological reasons to stir up tensions with Russia This fuels discord and creates an unstable world Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Imagine if a major Russian media outlet carried an article with the headline, How We Can Defeat Obama ùIt s pretty certain that within minutes various pro NATO analysts would be all over Twitter labeling it as hybrid warfare, Russian aggression ùor even, heaven forbid, hot war Or whatever this month s agreed catchphrase is Let s take it a step further Ponder what would happen if the same pundits then realized the author was a recently redundant Russian Defense Department official Without any doubt, the concern o meter would reach the stratosphere Soon, the topic would be trending on Neocon Twitter Neocon Twitter, by the way, is different than normal Twitter In this version, all dissenting voices are blocked Last week, NewsweekpublishedEvelyn Farkas, the former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia (whovacatedthe post only last October) In her incredibly aggressive op ed, Farkas explained How We Can Defeat Putin ùThe same Putin who is the popularly elected President of Russia The world s second strongest military power Farkas is now an employee of the pro NATO Atlantic Council, which the formerly venerable Newsweek appears to have partnered with The Atlantic Council isfundedby the US State Department, the US Army, the US Air Force, the UAE & Bahraini governments and various other vested interests None of them are particularly supportive of Russia On the other hand, most would directly benefit from increased NATO spending How does Farkas propose defeating ùPutin? By spending more money on NATO, of course Also, she suggests sending more weapons to Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova Of course, it was American meddling in the first two that created the current tensions The latter country is currentlyenduringa political crisis and mass protests This is ignored in the western media, because the corrupt incumbent regime is pro Washington Farkas suggests arming the Syrian opposition, the loose coalition that includes the Al Nusra front, which is part of Al Qaeda, the same folks whoattackedNew York on September 11, 2001 Not to mention, that such a course of action would destroy the nascent ceasefire in that unfortunate country Reading between the lines, Farkas is essentially suggesting that Washington use Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia (and anti Assad forces in Syria) as pawns against Russia With no concern for the economic wellbeing, or safety, of the people who live in those countries (or those in Russia) The complicated ethnic situation in those regions also seems to be irrelevant The only priority is American interests Which are sacrosanct BREAKING:#Pentagonwants $582bn in funding as part of fiscal year 2017 budgethttps:// tdotco

1956 uprising That embryonic freedom movement was brutally oppressed by Nikita Khrushchev s USSR Thus, it s understandable that Evelyn has an axe to grind with Russia, even if many of its current leaders weren t even born at that time Indeed, it seems almost certain that Farkas rhetoric projects her own deeply embedded distrust of Russia Naturally, that hasn t harmed her career Hawkish anti Russian views are attractive to the US military industry, which requires atangible enemyto maintain funding levels A glance at herbiographyshows a meteoric rise, which includes top positions at NATO However, Farkas s perspective outlines all that s wrong with how the US interacts with the rest of the world today She s calling for the defeat of a leader with 80 percent approval ratings, because he doesn t support US foreign policy objectives If Putin prevents America taking over the world, he must be removed It s Doctor Evil stuff This fanatical analyst believes that Russia is a threat to America However, it s NATO which has been expanding during the past two decades, while Moscow has taken a defensive, often highly reactionary posture For example, in Syria, Assad s forces had the upper hand in Aleppo and would surely have taken the city, but Putin agreed a ceasefire rather than continue the bloodshed there A real life expansionist warmonger would have kept the fighting going In reality, it s America which has been aggressive in this century Illegally invading Iraq, destroying Libya, facilitating the collapse of Yemen and the Syrian Civil War In Russia s backyard, Washington has openly fomented uprisings in Georgia and Ukraine, the results of which have subsequently been rejected at the ballot box The US backed regimes in Kiev and Tbilisi were both eventually voted out after the Orange ù and Rose ù revolutions The current Maidan administration in Kiev now has lowerapproval ratingsthan the democratically elected, if corrupt, government it replaced This indicates that they were never popular upheavals to begin with, but rather driven by capital city liberals, without mass backing in the provinces The Washington elite believes that it can dictate to Russians about how they should be governed They also present fringe opposition figures, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky or Garry Kasparov, as realistic alternatives to Putin In the real world, serious Russia experts know that these characters have almost no support inside the country As it happens, should Putin be removed as President, or voluntarily resign, it s much more likely that his successor would be far more hardline in their attitude to the West By Russian standards, Putin is a moderate The vast majority of Russians are far less tolerant of America s behavior than their President Another Neocon obsession is with NATO expansion Their argument is that countries wish to join the alliance and that it s not Russia s business That fails to take into account how poor these states are The likes of Montenegro and Albania can choose to use their own meager resources to maintain a military or (https://www nationalpriorities org/campaigns/us military spending vs world/) have their defense spending largely looked after by America The same America that spends as much on its army as the next nine countries combined With NATO, comes money Lots of it Dollars are attractive to impoverished nations Doubtless, if Russia could match US largesse, the situation would probably be very different Thus, America buys loyalty and these nations become little more than US military bases in Washington s eyes The problem with Farkas Newsweek diatribe, and other similarly bellicose American discourse, is how downright dangerous it is These people believe that any leadership, no matter how popular at home, with an agenda contrary to Washington is invalid and must be removed or defeated They don t acknowledge the absurdity that if Russia followed the same logic, there would be an apocalypse This is because they believe that only the US is allowed to have and pursue interests A certain cabal in Washington thinks that only America, and countries that do its bidding are truly

"13 Oct, 2015",How Newsweek gets Russia wrong,"In the internet age, anti Russia commentary very quickly circulates around the world It lingers online, waiting to be cited by another op ed writer, thus feeding the cycle of nonsense in the so called analysis of Russia in Western discourse One of the main sources for factually challenged diatribes is think tanks In an era of miserly budgets, cash

an aggressive, authoritarian nation ready to unleash its huge nuclear arsenal He blames Russian media domestic and foreign branding it propaganda The German academic also insists that NATO and the EU are innocent targets of the Russian press The propaganda machine s constant repetition that NATO, the European Union and its allies are after Russia s lands and resources has convinced many Russians they must stick together to secure their nation s physical survival, ùUmland writes It s worth noting that the US is responsible for 70 percent ofNATO spending Thus, it can legitimately be argued that NATO is a tool of US foreign policy, dressed up as an alliance of equals Also, the very ethos of NATO is currently confusing Alliance bosses have longportrayedit as a force for the spread of democracy However, long standing member Turkey has been openlyrolling backfreedoms in recent years, with no apparent consequences READ MORE: Kurdish PKK militant group pledges to stop attacks in Turkey ahead of elections In reality, nothing sullies NATO s name more thanNATO s own behavior Its assertive expansion eastwards, andillegal warswaged against sovereign states in the 1990 s and 2000 s have hardly improved its image Thus, the notion that Russian media is a major reason for negative perceptions of NATO power in the West is patently absurd As it happens, the largest Europeanprotestsagainst American military aggression took place on February 15, 2003, with three million marching in Rome alone On the same day, 1 3 million rallied in Barcelona Another million marched through the streets of London It is implausible that RT influenced this movement, given that RT wasn t founded until 2005 Aside from NATO, the EU is doing a fine job of destabilizing itself, without any help from Russian media interests The union s third most powerful member, Britain, is threatening to leave, egged on by its own establishment newspapers, most notably theDaily MailandDaily Telegraph Newsweek, with

Witnesses recall horrific#Kunduzhospital airstrikehttp:// tdotco /yVkEnpjR18pic twitter com/qsczSoEXNy In light of all these deep seated problems, to suggest, as Umland does, that Russian media plays a part in the EU s woes is outrageously dishonest The real reason that elitist American institutions like the Atlantic Council detest the likes of RT is because they cannot dictate to it Popular media in the US, such as the New York Times, or the UK, for example the Sunday Times, is so beholden to NATO and government interests that Washington foreign policy bigwigs can t comprehend a critical news outlet gaining popularity Hence, when the New York Times publishes articles based on government sources, that is considered news Yet, when RT carries legitimate stories that counter the established narrative that is termed propaganda For example, if American and British troops, under the NATO banner, hold exercises in the Baltic States, Western media calls it training Britain s publically owned BBC even embedded a reporter with participants in defense of Europe When Russia does the same, inside its own territory, Moscow s actions are labeled ùaggressive ùby the UK press Umland continues: RT s pseudo pacifist stance began to lose clout with the start of Russia s all too obvious hybrid war against Ukraine The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 by a Russian missile (unproven) over Ukrainian territory in 2014 has been particularly damaging It dealt a lethal blow to the propaganda strategies of RT and other Russian outlets aimed at muddying the waters of Western public opinion on Russia s military escalation in the Donbass ù Not only was RT not muddying the waters, ùit strived to inform the world about Ukraine long before Donbass erupted RT crews wereshot at by snipersin Kiev during the US backed coup that removed President Yanukovich in early 2014 Later, RT journalists exposed the hardships of civilians in Eastern Ukraine something mostly ignored by Western media and Ukraine s domestic services In fact, RT attempted to cover the other side in the civil war, but Kiev repeatedlybanned our correspondentsfrom its territory Umland is not a journalist, but that hardly excuses him from ignoring facts in his opinion pieces His Wikipediaentry(the link to his Atlantic Council biography is invalid) says he s a political scientist, historian and Russian language interpreter A product of East Germany, he teaches at Kiev s National University, Mohyla Academy This institution, which is partiallyAmerican funded, served as theheadquartersof the 2004 orangerevolution As someone who works in Kiev, Umland is surrounded by militant Russophobia His views certainly seem to align with the virulently anti Russian post coup elite in Ukraine The kinds of people who run the show in Ukraine nowadays are deeply unpleasant TakeAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who recently shared a message from a Facebook friend ù who wants to help ISIS militants take revenge against Russian forces in Syria in accordance with Sharia law The majority of Gerashchenko s Facebook friends supported the idea, calling it brilliant ùand effective ù The new Ukrainian authoritiesbanned376 Russian films and TV series andoutlawedTV channels in Russian This despite the fact that83 percent of Ukrainiansresponding to a 2008 Gallup poll preferred to use Russian instead of Ukrainian to take the survey Census results suggesting that Ukraine has more Ukrainian speakers than Russian are not borne out in reality In 2005, even Kiev s Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciencesadmittedthat 58 percent of Ukrainians speak Russian at home The real figure is probably much higher Umland concludes that there s nothing to discuss with the Russian authorities Instead, he says, we ùhave to address the Russian audience directly: Neither better diplomacy with the Kremlin nor a boost in NATO s military capacity will overcome this threat Instead of engaging in ever more diplomatic activism and spending more on weapons, the West s leaders and thinkers should ponder how and what to communicate to the Russian people living both inside and outside Russia How can we reach them and make them believe that we are not their enemies? Where should we put our money and direct our energy to tackle not the symptoms but the root of our problem with Moscow? Finding practical answers and workable instruments to address these issues will make the Earth a safer place for all of us, ùhe writes Essentially, Umland is wondering how Americans (because in NATO terms they are we ) can reach out to Russians and tell them that the growing NATO presence on their doorstep is extremely good for them That s akin to tempting turkeys with positive news about Christmas RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/318584-newsweek-gets-russia-wrong/

Political analysts immediately noted that the protests in the streets of the Armenian capital resemble the first stage of the colorrevolution we ve seen in the past in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan Head of the International Committee in Russia s upper house of parliament, Konstantin Kosachev said: It s no use deluding yourself; all colorrevolution s have developed along these lines Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan acted fast All people arrested during clashes with the police were released within hours But the US Embassy in Yerevan expressed concern ù about reports of excessive use of force by the police and urged the Armenian government to conduct a thorough investigation Sargsyan ordered his government to compensate the price hike until a special commission investigated the situation in the national energy market But the demonstrators were not ready to compromise It was a decentralized networked protest that preferred ultimatums READ MORE: Firefighters v arsonists: US confirms $5bn spent on Ukraine democracy The protest did not have a political leader and was not even backed by political parties, but very quickly the political component become dominant, its target being the Armenian government Armenia was pushed to choose between East and West, North and South, between the Russian Federation and the European Union the impossible choice that Ukraine now being torn apart in a bloody civil war was forced to choose The universal formula effectively used by the Americans in Tbilisi and Kiev should have worked once again in the streets of Yerevan But it did not The Armenian president appeared to be different: he could go on a hard but effective compromise with the opposition The slogan Armenia is something, other than Armenia (Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran or Europe) is totally unrealistic Which is not understood in Washington, where the political elite today truly believes that the most cherished dream of any country in the world is to become another United State This is wrong And this is why American political and social technologies are not at all universal Even the Little Steps ù their favorite know how didn t work in Yerevan: when the protesters came forward with an ultimatum to move their barricade forward a yard a day towards the Presidents palace, the police made a Big Step and simply dispersed the demonstration And it proved to be quite a popular step in the neighborhood, sick and tired of the endless traffic jams of the last couple of weeks READ MORE: Anything US touches turns into Libya or Iraq : Top Putin quotes at youth forumThe Armenian government was smart enough to make its final move on the night, when all the Anglo Saxon media was following the OXI referendum, forcing the US to choose their priority: Securing the NATO bases in Greece, or trying to get another one in the Caucasus Or, maybe not The foreign factor that during the events in Ukraine led the orangerevolution to the Twitter top and made a global information trend, too, did not play into the hands of the opposition in Armenia As a matter of fact, street protest has long been part of Armenian political culture They hit the streets in 2008, unwilling to accept the election results, and later, trying to save the city parks from demolition But they never went over the top, respecting the social laws and common sense The following comment by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov seems to me the best assessment of what happened in Armenia this summer: Many are tempted to use the current developments in Armenia, in order to whip up anti government sentiment, although the root of these events was purely economic, Lavrov said For some, apparently, it seems useful to go further and develop these processes in a political way The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/310277-armenia-revolution-nuland-protests/

Srdja Trifkovic:When he s on the scene, you can be sure that there can be destabilization of the regime under the auspices of democratic change The context is quite clear Only ten days ago, Kyrgyzstan officially became a member of the Eurasian economic union, after passing the accession process by the parliaments of other members: Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Armenia which, of course, is a red flag to the State Department A year earlier, the US lease at Manas Air Base had ceased, and effectively, the US was watching one of the putative, important geostrategic assets in Central Asia slipping away It s curious that they weren t so concerned about this particular human rights case as they call it while they were still in possession of the Manas Airport The sentencing came in 2011, several months after the ethnic riots, and secondly, there s no doubt we re witnessing an activist for Uzbek separatism being lionized in much the same way as Albanian separatists in Serbia, who were actively involved in the clashes with police and the military in the late 1990s, were being celebrated and feted in Washington as human rights activists and victims of violence READ MORE: Afghanistan: The USSR left, the US wants to stay So this is just more of the same: whenever relations between the US and a certain country deteriorate because the country is no longer keen to be the US strategic asset like a joker from the sleeve human rights activists are produced, in this particular case, most likely, guilty of grievous crimes RT:Let s speak more about the significance of Kyrgyzstan The US had a presence at the country s Manas Air Base for many years How important is the country to the Americans? ST:It s funny that there is no country in the world that isn t important to the Americans nowadays Central Asia is the very heart of what Scottish geographer [Halford] Mackinder would have called the heartland And it s obviously an area where ostensibly the US doesn t have vital interests It s a land locked country, one of many in the former Soviet Central Asia, an area which is logically if we look at the map a field where Russia, China, and perhaps to a lesser extent, India, have vital interests but certainly not the US The US interest in Kyrgyzstan is purely the reflection of the strategy of full spectrum global dominance In other words, there isn t a single square foot in the world where vital US national interests are not involved READ MORE: US to boost military aid to Israel after Iran nuclear deal I m rather glad that Kirgizstan has seen the light and decided to throw in its lot with Eurasian Economic Union, because in practical terms, in terms of its economic development, especially agriculture; and in geopolitical terms that s where it should look for its future, that s where the future investment will come from Depending on an umbilical cord that is 7,000 8,000 miles long, with distant friends on the other side of the Atlantic in this particular case, would not have been a rational strategy for the nation Brian Becker from the Answer Coalition beleives the award is an attempt by the US State Department to lend its support to the political opposition RT:How much politics is involved in the State Department s award? Brian Becker:The State Department s award is pure politics This is designed to support the opposition Here s an individual who is in prison facing life imprisonment for murder, for incitement against other peoples, a major crime Whatever the outcome of the trial, it s pure politics on the part of the State Department to award this medal and clearly designed to support and stimulate the opposition inside the country RT:It s been reported that Azimzhan Askarov was actively supported by U S diplomat Richard Miles who some call the father of the colored revolutions What s the connection here? BB:It s pure politics You have the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the orangerevolution in Ukraine, the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan We have the State Department and the CIA having fallen upon this device of the colorrevolution to carry out regime change in all of the non Russian, former Soviet republics and with allied countries from Central and Eastern Europe all with an effort to not bring human rights, not to bring democracy, but to move these countries into the US s sphere of influence So you have the stimulation of opposition forces to carry out coordinated so called colorrevolution s which are really coordinated by CIA operatives and NGOs working with the CIA, and it s all for their purpose to absorb these countries into America s sphere of influence That s it RT:The US had a presence at the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan for years What importance does the country have for the Americans?

"25 May, 2015",Japanese nationalism: Decoy for American imperialism?,"As the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to amend the country s US drafted constitution, granting the Tokyo s military the power to wage war, some fear the return of old imperialistic tendencies Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Japan is ready to change
 its post war pacifist constitution; it is rapidly arming itself
 to the teeth, building battleships and purchasing fighter jets 
 Recruitment posters are everywhere Meanwhile, Japan is standing
 obediently and loyally by its occupier and closest ally, the
 United States In light of the situation, one has to wonder what is really
 nationalist about Abe? His loyalties appear to lie towards the
 West, particularly the United States Definitely not towards his
 own country and the Asian continent All that the US desires, Japan supports Washington is dreaming
 about a Pacific Century , in which it would play a
 decisive role; it is relentlessly promoting its Pivot to Asia 
 doctrine, which envisions Japan firmly by its side, militarily
 and demagogically; it is pushing for 12 nations Trans Pacific
 Partnership (TPP), and Japan claps In Wakkanai the northernmost city in Japan from which the
 Russian island of Sakhalin can be seen military radars and
 surveillance systems are humming and coastguard ships are
 standing by in the historic harbor, ready for action Almost all signs in the city are written in Japanese and Russian,
 including those warning that male visitors to the hot spring will
 be prosecuted if they enter the female section From the window of my hotel I can see Sakhalin, if weather
 allows During the summer, two mighty sea vessels are shuttling
 Japanese tourists between Wakkanai and the Russian town of
 Korsakov, situated on Sakhalin Island Russian fishing boats
 regularly visit Hokkaido Island, where there are cultural
 exchanges and even some trade In the Pechika restaurant, delicious Russian food is served, beer
 flows and Russian songs are sung (a popular tune is A
 million red roses ) Across from the parking lot, the
 Fukak≈ç ichiba complex proudly displays old black and white photos
 from the days when Sakhalin, and in fact all of the Kuril
 Islands, belonged to Japan The islands constitute an issue that has never been resolved 
 Japanese propaganda is constantly repeating the claim that the
 Soviet Union grabbed the Kurils at the end of WWII For decades
 Japan has been demanding their return But even in Wakkanai, not everyone is convinced that Russia
 should be compromising on the issue A captain of a small
 Japanese fishing vessel explains: We have an extreme right wing prime minister here in Japan 
 He is very close to the United States, a country that is
 antagonizing, and in fact most likely wants to destroy, both
 Russia and China If the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin go back to
 Japan, they would be immediately converted into another Okinawa;
 full of US Air Force and naval bases, very near the Russian
 mainland ù Some 3,000km away, the former ancient kingdom of Okinawa is
 living a continuous nightmare of occupation and consequent
 militarization From here, thousands of US and Japanese aircraft
 regularly provoke China and North Korea At the same time, local
 residents are outraged at the occupation as massive
 demonstrations shake the islands; people are demanding an end to
 the US military presence and want the US bases dismantled But
 Abe s government wants more US hardware, more runways and more
 war games I worked in Okinawa on two occasions The last time was in
 2013/14 when I was involved with a documentary film about the
 American bases, Battle of Okinawa , for South American
 network TeleSUR Douglas Lummis, an ex US Air Force pilot who is now a writer and
 professor, explained the situation to me in the city of Nahu: Okinawa hosts about 75 percent of the American troops and
 American facilities in Japan It s out of sight and out of mind
 of most of the Japanese people on the mainland Okinawa is a
 thousand miles away from Tokyo, from the capital If you talk to
 Okinawans they re angry and disappointed that for over 60 years
 now they ve been asked to essentially shoulder the
 American Japanese military alliance The military alliance with
 America is also accompanied by what critics would say a
 subservient attitude towards Washington in general Japan rarely
 balks against what Washington wishes on foreign policy ù The bases are now expanding even to pristine parts of Okinawa,
 like Haneko Bay Okinawan scholar Masaki Tomochi has expressed alarm by what he
 perceives to be the imperialist tendencies of both the US and
 Japan He is well aware of the suffering of local people: We think that US imperialism uses Japanese colonialism
 against us The Japanese government made a security treaty with
 the United States, and then the United States used Japan to force
 us, Okinawans, to accept the US military bases, ùhe
 explained There is no doubt that the bases are there to antagonize, to
 provoke China and North Korea, as well as Russia Many believe
 that the WWIII could easily begin from Okinawa Geoffrey Gunn, a leading Australian historian and Professor
 emeritus at Nagasaki University, is concerned about Japan s
 increasingly aggressive role in the region: All changed when the Abe government nationalized the
 Senkaku/Diaoyu [Islands] The status quo changed because now
 Japan declares that there is actually no dispute over these
 so called disputed islands Therefore the Tokyo government has
 angered China China is indignant with this change of the status
 quo ù For many years, Japan was able to boast of the smallest
 disparities between rich and poor anywhere in the world, as well
 as developing an incredibly compassionate social model No matter
 how right wing some its rulers may have been, in many ways, Japan
 could easily pass as a socialist country But there is one essential problem: It is socialist only for its own people For decades, Japanese corporations have been behaving like
 colonialist thugs all over East Asia For instance, I was told
 repeatedly that Japanese car manufacturers had destroyed many
 cities, corrupting local governments, forcing them not to build
 comprehensive public transportation systems Now numerous
 megalopolises like Jakarta or Surabaya, which are choking on car
 and scooter fumes, lack a single subway line or light rail
 system The reason for this is largely explained by Japan s efforts at
 indoctrinating Asian peoples with a pro Western worldview For
 decades, Japanese universities had been offering scholarships to students from poor Southeast Asian
 nations They would indoctrinate these students with pro Western
 dogmas, breaking the revolutionary spirit, while converting young
 people to behave as servants of the Empire; essentially doing to
 other Asians what was done to the Japanese After being defeated in WWII, Japan eventually became loyal to
 its Western masters Many Asian leaders, including former
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, demanded that Japan return to Asia ùIt never did It became rich
 during the Korean War, manufacturing goods and equipment for the
 Western military might It continued doing the same during the
 Vietnam War It is on the same course now David McNeill, Irish professor at the prestigious Sofia
 University in Tokyo, also works for the NHK, Japan s national
 broadcaster He is increasingly critical of the new, militarized
 and indoctrinated Japan: They are rewriting text books; they skip through WWII, dedicating
 to it only eight pages Nationalism is rising Naoki Hyakuta, a
 comedy writer, published a novel about Kamikaze fighters,
 entitled Forever Zero The novel sold 5 million
 copies! You know that nothing sells 5 million copies in Japan! Abe read the book and loved it He put him on board of
 directors of NHK! And the director of NHK is another right wing
 thug ù David continued, increasingly outraged: There is so much self censorship in Japanese media, now And
 the government is issuing guidelines , so called Orange Book ,
 for instance: how to treat anything that is contagious  or
 anything related to history There are instructions to writers
 and translators For instance: never use words like Nanking
 Massacre, except when you quote foreign experts Or Yasukuni
 Shrine ì never use word controversial ù in connection to it We
 cannot write about sexual slaves from WWII ù I am also told that the Japanese public is given a one sided
 interpretation of current affairs When it comes to topics like
 Russia, Syria and China, Japanese people are made to consume
 Western propaganda exclusively And they actually believe what the NHK says, ùsays
 David As we are implementing images from Hong Kong s Umbrella
 Revolution into my film with Noam Chomsky, my film editor,
 Hata Takeshi, smiles: In Japan, people will not understand that the West is behind
 those color revolutions and recent events in Hong Kong Here,
 there is total consensus that HK was a movement for freedom and
 democracy It is because there are hardly any alternative sources
 of information available ù Even in the places like Abu Dhabi and Beirut, television channels
 like RT are available in every major hotel Not in Japan In all
 big international chains, it is mainly a diet of local channels,
 plus CNN, BBC and Fox It appears that dissatisfaction with Japan s present political
 course is visible everywhere, and not only in some small,
 anti establishment circles Former vice president of a major
 civil engineering company, Segi Sakashi, 79 years old, recently
 expressed his outrage to me: With an extremely close relationship with the US, and an
 antagonist approach towards Russia, China and others, Prime
 Minister Abe appears to be highhandedly bringing the country into
 military conflict with its neighbors, namely Korea and China,
 while the population is completely ignorant of this and stuck
 with ever shrinking social services What is absurd and ridiculous about all this is that there
 does not exist any need whatsoever to antagonize our neighbors 
 China is one of the main trading partners of Japan So is Korea 
 We have been growing (or shrinking) economically, through mutual
 gains and losses Honestly, Abe is playing a very stupid game
 thinking that because of the 1960 Security Treaty with the US, we
 should be behaving like this ù All over Japan, white markers grow from the grass in parks and
 other public places Black messages in several languages proclaim May Peace Prevail on Earth! ù Considering Japan s foreign policy, these words could be
 interpreted as hypocrisy, even cynicism Japan is working hard to
 support the West at the very moment when the West is pushing the
 world towards a possibly fatal confrontation with peaceful but
 mighty nations, like China and Russia For this, Japanese leaders are facing fury in many parts of Asia,
 but great support and admiration in the West It is timely to
 recall the words of the great Japanese philosopher, Tenshin
 Okakura, who wrote more than 100 years ago in his work, The
 Book of Tea : The average Westerner, in his sleek complacency, will see in
 the tea ceremony but another instance of the thousand and one
 oddities which constitute the quaintness and childishness of the
 East to him He was wont to regard Japan as barbarous while she
 indulged in the gentle arts of peace: he calls her civilized
 since she began to commit wholesale slaughter on Manchurian
 battlefields ù The Asian continent would be delighted if Japan would stick to
 its tea ceremonies, especially after sending Prime Minister Abe
 to his ideological adopted homeland across Pacific Ocean The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/261693-japan-us-dangerous-right-wing/

 EU, Russia and the US should get involved in negotiating an end

 led to greater economic damage than the war waged against the
 rebels in the east of the country In 2014 alone, Ukraine lost $US 12 billion in foreign investment
 while the public withdrew more than $9 billion from Ukrainian
 banks, Yushchenko said If you lose financial stability and control over prices and
 money, you lose not only the capability for economic development
 but all other social issues, ù he said According to estimates, Ukrainian GDP is expected to shrink this
 year by another 12 percent, Yushchenko said, describing this as a catastrophe ù Yushchenko was the third president of Ukraine from 2005 to 2010

 administration The bad news for the post Maidan regime doesn t end there Less
 than 12 months since assuming office, President Petro
 Poroshenko s approval rating is now 33 percent, according to a
 second poll from Razumkov Disturbingly, their findings suggest
 that only 12 6 percent of respondents fully support the oligarch His prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, fares even worse Only 7 8
 percent expressed complete satisfaction with his performance 
 Worryingly for the PM, who last week wasdescribedas the most dangerous man in

 actively disapprove of his work in government It s an astounding
 fall from grace for Yatsenyuk, famously handpicked by the US
 State Department s Victoria Nuland to head up a pro Washington

 itself in fast forward In 2005, a year after mass street
 protests, Viktor Yushchenko enjoyed ratings of 60 percent plus 
 By 2010, he polled a mere 5 percent and could only watch as the
 subsequently ousted president, Viktor Yanukovich, took power It s worth noting that the government has almost complete control
 of (or support from) Ukraine s media, making its devastating poll
 numbers even more startling Billionaire Poroshenko personally
 owns the Channel 5 TV network and the other leading channels are
 the playthings of friendly fellow oligarchs Additionally, there
 is not much of an opposition to speak of The only explanation for the regime s calamitous ratings is the
 economic crisis The same emergency the west chooses to ignore

 bright future, the Maidan movement has in fact destroyed the

 Russian and EU neighbors is now impoverished by collation with
 many African states This is a tragedy Ukraine s currency, the hryvnia, hasfallenby 66 5 percent since January 2014

 protests, it was $405 Regardless of what is happening in
 austerity hit Europe, Yatsenyuk and Poroshenko have led
 Ukrainians to the poorhouse Rating agency Moody s reports that 12 Ukrainian banks have lost
 their licenses since January, on top of the 17 banks that lost
 them last year In a futile attempt to halt the hryvnia plunge,
 interest rates were raised to 19 5 percent last month Amidst all
 this, around 40 percent of Ukraine s bank loans are denominated
 in foreign currency (almost all euros or dollars) Furthermore, Rostislav Balaban, a lecturer at the National
 University of Kiev Mohyla Academy, has suggested that the cost of
 bribes has doubled While lamentable, this is a very urgent
 matter in a country where almost every interaction with the state

 Yatsenyuk to have a carefully crafted plan to pull Ukraine back
 from the brink, wouldn t you? Alas, in a sure sign that he

 claimed In a wonderful case of karma, it appears that the Maidan
 crew wanted to expose fraud committed by the previous Yanukovich

 After events of the past 12 months, it s surely in their
 interests to attempt a rapprochement with the Russophone south
 and east However, Poroshenko s pro US regime has another plan Instead of
 devoting every waking hour to the fiscal crisis, they have
 introduced a law which prohibits the showing of any Russian
 films, documentaries, serials or cartoons made since
 January 2014 or any productions portraying the aggressor
 country (Russia) in a favorable light made after August 1991
 (when Soviet hardliners attempted to overthrow Gorbachev) At a time when the very viability of the Ukrainian economy is in
 question, the best policy Poroshenko can muster is to ban Russian
 cartoons Presumably, his minions are also working on a
 memory wiping machine for adults? Russian culture is a fact of life in Ukraine Almost everybody

 Russian cartoons, reality shows and soap operas won t change
 that For Ukraine to survive, the country s fractured unity must be

"20 Mar, 2015","May 9 boycott calls defile Russian dead, shame American survivors","For the last 14 months the world has witnessed an international relations debacle the likes of which no history book has yet recorded The latest relations ruination tale unveils three more US ambassadors to Ukraine bereft of their senses This is a story some of you will not believe, and one some will
 be ashamed to hear As for this American, I am outraged This asinine LA TimesOp Edwill have framed for you most of what is wrong in our
 world When I heard that three former US diplomats had suggested
 moving the victory in Europe (VE Day) celebrations from Moscow to
 Kiev, Ukraine, I choked from laughter I thought it was a joke,
 to be honest Then I read the piece, the madness in it sank in, and my dead
 ancestors whispered Foul, this will not stand Here is a quote
 from the piece, to save you the reader some time Now remember,
 20 times more Russians died that Americans or Brits in World War
 II Western leaders could not sit in a reviewing stand on Red
 Square and watch parading Russian troops, whose comrades had
 recently waged war in eastern Ukraine Let that sink in for a moment They cannot pay their respects to
 an ally in the fight to end a planned 1000 year Reich that would
 have subjugated a billion people and exterminated an entire race?
 When your head is done wobbling, recall 100 other insipid ideas
 spewed from the mouths of such as these the last months Whether
 or not you believe CNN or Fox News, rerouting history and
 debauching the honored dead is insufferable Europe is not speaking German and goose stepping right now
 because tens of millions of Russians fought with bare hands if
 need be to prevent it Their honor and dignity is something every
 human being on Earth should acknowledge, just as other nations
 are so revered Excuse me, I m going to have to shine floodlights on Steven
 Pifer, John Herbst and William Taylor; the Three Stooges of all
 that is wrong in America The victory celebrated on May 9 in
 Moscow, the conflict Russians refer to as the Great Patriotic
 War , should be no less venerated by Americans Russians saved
 millions of our parents and grandparents lives Surely
 intelligent people can calculate the forces arrayed against
 Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and the armies of the
 so called Axis Powers Pifer, Herbst and Taylor are uneducated,
 crazy or driven by unseen interests, in my view The leader of my Stooges, Steven Pifer, is a think tank fellow,
 if you can imagine that A senior fellow at theBrookings
 Institution s Center on the United States and Europe, the former
 Ukraine ambassador is also (not surprisingly) Zbigniew
 Brzezinski s fellow Russophobe I ve not space to aptly frame his
 part in the current US policy debacle, but the sentient reader
 can add two and two These people are devoutRussia haters, plain and simple, and somehow the American
 people do not see the danger If you need more proof that Pifer belongs nowhere near a US
 embassy, track down areportnamed Mutual Security on Hold?
 Russia, the West, and European Security Architecture , via
 another think tank country club in America These men write many
 books showing their intellectual prowess, but I put it to you, as
 Oscar Wilde once said The books that the world calls immoral
 are books that show the world its own shame ù On to former Ambassador John Herbst s frolicking among this
 triumvirate of Brzezinski trolls, his bureaucratic resume reads
 is solidified in one post, in Ukraine about the time of the
 orangerevolution Herbst was around ù when everything going on
 in Kiev today was just a strategy on somebody s agenda 
 Associations with alleged criminals like Yury Lutsenko, his
 efforts at setting up so called unbiased media in Ukraine The career diplomat has also been the director of theNational
 Defense UniversityCenter for Complex Operations since 2010 
 For those who wonder if he is a spook NSA or CIA type, the
 places he s been posted and the initiatives and money he s
 overseen are not mutually exclusive of such The same faces being
 seen at critical events around the world, that s the sort of clue
 any chief inspector might look for from the scene of the crime The third servant of US democracy, William Taylor, is a surprise
 for me personally A graduate of the military academy at West
 Point, Taylor has all the earmarks of a man of honor Unless he s
 a product of Army Intelligence, he s assuredly aware of EXACTLY
 how dishonorable shunning Red Square on May 9 will be If a man of honor, someone entrusted as Taylor has been, is
 somehow involved in a misinformation campaign, a mudslinging fit
 by the Obama administration, there s deep trouble ahead in my
 view Taylor is key at the highly controversial United States Institute
 of Peace(USIP) While administration mouthpieces and senatorial
 supports claim USIP is a vital instrument for peace, detractors
 claim the so called peace organization actually looks more like
 the study of new and potential means of aggression The trade
 embargoes, massive sanctions, and even the European austerity
 programs we see, are said to be levers Washington pulls to exert
 US worldwide hegemony If Taylor is not an Army Intelligence (INCSOM) product,
 Washington missed a good chance at one Maybe the creed of these
 soldiers is aptly stated here: I am a Soldier first, but an intelligence professional
 second to none With pride in my heritage, but focused on the future,Performing the first task of an Army:To find, know, and never lose the enemy With a sense of urgency and of tenacity, professional and
 physical fitness,and above all, INTEGRITY, for in truth lies victory Always at silent war, while ready for a shooting war,The silent warrior of the ARMY team ù As for victory in truth, we all know that the end victory for
 humanity depends on who is defining what truth Certainly making
 a lie of tens of millions of dead soldiers sacrifices, defiling
 their memory in a barefaced lie, this is an act of dishonor A
 Japanese soldier would commitseppukuas an act of
 Bushido, and a Soviet soldier under then commissar Nikita
 Sergeyevich Khrushchev, he d simply be handed a loaded pistol I hope I ve made no secret of my personal disdain for what these
 men suggest, and for what they represent After all, this is what
 op ed pieces are for Russia, like any other country, has her
 skeletons tucked inside dark closets However deeply buried any
 Kremlin state secret may be, the world today or tomorrow cannot
 be misled from the iron fact and utter decency that May 9
 demands I leave you with some thoughts on these matters from an
 institute founded to further the ideals of a great American WWII
 general and later president, Dwight Eisenhower On the WW II Soviet Experience the Eisenhower Institute s JT
 Dykman prefaces the perspective with aquoteand footnote from Eisenhower himself,
 it is poignant for those of you able to imagine: When we flew into Russia, in 1945, I did not see a house
 standing between the western borders of the country and the area
 around Moscow Through this overrun region, Marshal Zhukov told
 me, so many numbers of women, children and old men had been
 killed that the Russian government would never be able to
 estimate the total I urge you my fellow human beings to read what s lain out via the
 good general s institute, it should be mandatory reading at West
 Point, especially given American generals on Fox News calling for
 still more dead Russians today We ve allowed indecent leadership, unruly secret interests, and
 complete nincompoops to sully every chance of peace in my
 lifetime Let s not dishonor our fallen forefathers further What
 a travesty that would be, I hope you ll agree As for the men
 I ve framed here, my father would have invited them on to the
 field at any hour of their choosing So who am I to argue against
 his bronze star? Phillip Butler for

"18 Feb, 2015",My Maidan memories: Living through Ukraine's nightmare year (Part 2),"It was a regular cold winter s day February 18, 2014 and nothing suggested trouble I was cooking dinner at home in Moscow whilst idly following Twitter reports of growing unrest in Kiev Oh, another one, ùI thought Just when I thought
 things were calming down ùWe d been down that very same
 road just a month earlier just when everyone thought things had
 come to a standstill, violence erupted READ MORE: Living through Ukraine s nightmare
 year (Part 1) Roughly six hours later I was standing alongside a huge RT crew
 at Kiev s Maidan Square, watching the protester occupied Labor
 Union building blazing It looked so much worse than before that
 it was genuinely terrifying But I still had no idea about the
 extent of the nightmare I just walked into But allow me to go back a little To New Year s Eve 2013 For a
 news reporter, these nights are not always about celebration and
 festivities, but work In December 2013, I was stationed in Kiev
 covering the ongoing Maidan protests, and management had told me
 several weeks earlier that I would be taking part in RT s special
 New Year coverage direct from Kiev s central square, which by
 then had endured a month long siege That particular Maidan looked like it was coming to end,
 inevitably Many who were strongly energized with protest spirit
 just a month earlier had become exhausted by this stalemate,
 which produced no visible results Some Kiev residents I knew 
 ardent opposition and supporters of Yanukovich alike had
 actually grown irritated with the Maidan Blocked streets, hordes
 of guests of the capital ùroaming central Kiev and no
 visible outcome from their dissent Even the authorities were no
 longer trying to shut the protest down in the early days of
 December 2013, I witnessed several attempts by police to disperse
 the tent camp It all came down to merely pushing and shoving,
 just like in the days of the 2004 orangerevolution This even made it into humorous folklore Ukrainians don t like
 to fight, they would rather patiently and non violently besiege
 the central square and wait until their foes just give up, having
 grown tired of seeing flags waved All factors considered, even
 optimistic supporters of Maidan among my friends turned
 skeptical, thinking this whole movement would completely die down
 as soon as it became too cold to protest My colleague,
 then reporter for the Russian news website Lenta ru, Ilya Azar,
 also suggested in his pre New Year piece that Maidan would likely
 disperse for lack of motivation and clear strategy I left Kiev on January 3, after almost two months, and I remember
 telling my wife as we boarded the plane: We might be in for
 an indefinite break from Kiev trips; I don t expect things to
 flare up here any time soon ù Again, we were all wrong thinking this protest could be over 
 Very, very wrong The situation started going belly up less than three weeks after
 New Year s Eve And that was another time I had to urgently board
 a plane to Kiev, literally not having finished dinner with my
 family Violence flared up at the corner of the so called
 governmental quarter just off Grushevskogo street Ironically,
 the situation exploded during what the opposition called a peace
 march on the parliament So much for peace I recall telling my crew when they asked me whether things were
 really bad this time that Ukraine could always treat us to an
 unexpected twist of events, but it seldom got really violent We
 were quickly proven that this was not an axiom, as we delved into
 the noisy protesters continuously banging on metal objects
 generating deafening cacophony epicenter of tensions on
 Grushevskogo Street, with the air above central Kiev poisoned
 with the scent of burning tires and tear gas Our January stint on Maidan was one crazy roller coaster The
 first few days or should I rather say nights were almost
 entirely sleepless We sat in our hotel room overlooking the riot
 scene (still, to this day, I think we had the best vantage point
 of all media covering the unrest) and waited for something to
 happen Some nights were calm, some were not, but we were always working 
 Endless live hits, frozen feet, tons of coffee and energy drinks 
 It was the first time since the protests began that bullets 
 although non lethal at that time started flying over central
 Kiev Violence started pouring over the edge from both sides,
 with protesters using Molotov cocktails against law enforcement
 officials, while the latter responded with rubber bullets and
 pellets I got hit on the back with those pellets quite
 obviously coming from the police twice while doing a report
 from the balcony of the hotel I don t know if it was deliberate
 or just a stray shot, but my bulletproof vest made sure my
 injuries were restricted to a slight swelling And then came the Unity Day of Ukraine, on January 22 I woke up
 at seven in the morning to a phone call from my cameraman Alex, you ve got to get over here, to my room, ùhe said
 with a shaking voice The police are on the offensive and
 they have just shot at me while I was trying to film out of the
 window Thank God they missed ùThe whole day was a bit of a
 blur we went live in the middle of the major brawl between the
 protesters and the police While I was on the receiving end of pellets reporting from the
 balcony, my colleague Peter Oliver found himself in the thick of
 the fighting Several hours later the first casualty was
 confirmed protester Sergey Nigoyan was said to have died after
 a supposedly non lethal police bullet hit him in the carotid
 artery Then another one dead a Belarusian mercenary fighting
 along the radical nationalist Ukrainian National
 Assembly Ukrainian People s Self Defense Organization (UNA UNSO)
 movement Things were spiraling out of control But as had usually
 happened in the case of Ukraine receded to another standstill
 just as quickly Not to mention a nervous standoff at the
 Ukrainsky Dom museum in the freezing cold for a few hours, with a
 few dozen policemen barricading themselves inside and protesters
 forcing them out It now seems naive, but we kept thinking all the time back then
 that this was surely the limit of this violence It couldn t get
 any worse than this, and the political forces would now find a
 compromise But it was the first time then that I had an idea
 which seemed crazy and unthinkable, maybe even like a conspiracy
 theory (which I genuinely despise): that somebody did not want
 the Maidan demonstrations to end That someone was interested in
 going to the very end That this protest was forcefully evolving
 from peaceful, popular and quite justified unrest into a violent
 cynical revolution, tailored to suit someone s needs Nevertheless, I left Kiev again in the first few days of
 February Again thinking my Maidan break would last for months 
 The opposition and those in power were negotiating, tires were no
 longer burning and the riot scene at the corner of Grushevskogo
 went quiet It was d√©j√† vu after emotions exploded for a short
 while, it went back to square one So typical and common Roughly
 10 days later, the 72 hours that changed Ukraine forever began On February 18, when we got to Maidan, it had literally turned
 into burning hell The whole square was ablaze The adjoining
 Trade Unions Building headquarters of the Maidan was blazing
 and flashbang grenades were exploding all over the place We made a bad choice in booking the same hotel where we had
 stayed in January, but we couldn t even get close to it a
 polite, yet very nervous policemen told us that area was unsafe
 and it was completely cordoned off They are using live
 rounds against us, ùwe were told by a sergeant We didn t
 have time to be shocked by such statement or attempt to verify it
 (although some popping sounds were indeed audible in the
 distance) We had to find a way to get settled and get our work
 done as soon as possible Going live all night via broadband, it was only by 7am that we
 found a way to sneak over to the other side of the barricade to
 the Hotel Ukraina where we had a studio for a proper live hit 
 And it took us almost a full hour to find a detour around the
 burning barricades From the height of the seventh floor, Maidan
 looked like a hellish cauldron The next day also filled with live reports and a lot of filming
 we heard of a symbolic truce which the opposition and the
 authorities struck It was then that I first made it to the
 police side of the protest, by the Dnipro Hotel I was wearing my
 press vest, and different policemen had, to put it mildly,
 different reactions to that Some were polite and cooperative;
 some shouted at me that I had to get the hell out of there In any case, I was interested in what the mood was like on the
 other side and had a few chats with them Needless to say I was
 surprised to learn that they were either boiling mad (for not
 being given orders to mash those protesters into the
 ground ù) or scared many of them again said they were shot
 at with live ammunition by the protesters Nevertheless, despite
 Maidan still burning and smoldering, it seemed that some kind of
 truce really was holding Some of the police by the government
 building were quite relaxed and told me they couldn t wait to
 change shifts standing out there in the freezing cold for days
 was taking a toll on them too Video:
 /files/opinionpost/38/f5/70/00/2591745_yarosh2_web mp4 On February 20, I woke up at 8am, as I had a live hit scheduled
 for 9am I monitored updates as I brushed my teeth it seemed
 that the night had passed relatively calmly and nothing suggested
 that things would go otherwise That s when I also received a
 text from my wife: It seems quite peaceful there, I just
 watched the news ùBut as I walked towards Hotel Ukraina I
 saw several flipped burnt cars on the sidewalk of Institutskaya
 Street A grumpy policeman told me that I could proceed down the street
 only at my own risk But there s a truce, isn t there? ùI asked He silently pointed at a burnt car, suggesting that was
 not the case As I made my way further down the street, I saw an
 absolutely blood chilling picture: scores of policemen lay on
 ambulance stretchers, all with different injuries Some were
 bleeding heavily One of them apparently had part of his hand
 blown off That did not look like a truce at all And by the time
 I reached my live hit spot just outside the hotel, the showdown
 began right as I spoke live on air You could see for yourselves in that raw video that things were
 spiraling out of control very quickly and, I have to admit, it
 was very scary Particularly because this was happening in one of
 the friendliest cities on the planet Just an hour later I filmed
 the first wounded (most of them later died) carried into the
 hotel lobby, which was turned into a field hospital by the
 protesters Several minutes after I filmed a video which still
 gives me a lot of doubts as to how this massacre happened on that
 day on it you could see unarmed protesters moving towards
 police lines and a man who just fired a rifle running back Video:
 /files/opinionpost/38/f5/70/00/2591744_yarosh1_web mp4 Just minutes later my cameraman and I were nearly killed in the
 hotel room we were about to broadcast live from by what looked
 like a sniper shot I don t really want to go on about this all
 over again especially with my colleagues now risking their
 lives in the war zone but I m still trying to understand who
 wanted us dead at that moment That brings me to the investigation of Maidan snipers Or should
 I say, the non investigation of it? In the most recent twist (and
 what a bizarre one too), the newly appointed prosecutor general
 of Ukraine said at a press conference in Kiev that investigators had no data supporting the notion that Maidan
 activists fired lethal rounds at the police ùThat was his
 response to a belated, but nonetheless important investigation by
 the BBC s Gabriel Gatehouse Oh, well So the people dressed in
 military uniforms and self made helmets who WE filmed firing
 sniper shots from the top floor of the Hotel towards the police
 lines must have been someone else then And 13 policemen who were confirmed dead on February 20 must have
 shot themselves And a guy who I filmed hastily retreating from
 the police lines with a smoking rifle must have just been taking
 a morning jog I don t mean to be overly sarcastic about this,
 but I would certainly appreciate it if those investigating the
 tragedy at the Maidan would consider the evidence we filmed, as
 well as witness accounts provided by the German ARD channel and
 the BBC The prosecutor general might also care to investigate why the
 coordinators from UNA UNSO movement the only ones present at
 the Maidan with actual military experience who had previously
 been sitting quietly in their tents on the square, were seen
 roaming around at Hotel Ukraina on that day, whilst one of them
 directed the initial assault on the police from the stage And
 there is plenty of documented evidence of that Just as he would
 probably want to investigate why one of the opposition MPs was
 trying to remove a sniper rifle in a case from the scene Or
 maybe the fact that those bullets which hit the interiors of the
 Hotel Ukraina were unmarked meaning they could not have
 belonged to law enforcement We would happily provide all the
 footage and physical evidence we have But nobody has ever asked
 for it As I ve said before, I despise and detest conspiracy theories 
 Until proven otherwise, I ll regard all statements and
 allegations that the Maidan massacre was orchestrated by the
 CIA/FSB as total nonsense I do not want to accuse anyone in
 particular with this article I do, however, feel that the spark
 which ignited the peaceful protest and turned it into a
 fully fledged murder spree came from someone else And it pains
 me personally that nothing is being done to investigate it There
 are still no solid facts proving involvement of any third party,
 but only because no efforts have been made by investigators And
 for my part, I know that this tragedy didn t happen out of the
 blue that it was well orchestrated Simply because I only
 believe my own eyes and I witnessed Maidan in its entirety from
 a small and cozy gathering on a warm November evening to the
 bloodletting catastrophe If you readpart 1of my Maidan memories, you know how I
 felt about this movement when it began I was largely on board
 with what the protesters were saying And I still refuse to
 believe that the very same people I shared the Maidan with back
 in November smart, peaceful and aspiring to changes for their
 country would have ever wanted to see corpses of their
 compatriots piling up on the streets of their capital Or would
 have taken up arms and become cold blooded killers Their idea
 was to inspire change through peaceful means, to change the
 government through early elections and make their country strong
 and prosperous Until what started as a movement with a noble cause was hijacked
 by those believing the change may only come through spilling a
 lot of blood Hijacked might sound like a bad clich√©, but to me
 this is exactly what happened with Maidan I have acquired enough
 accounts from policemen prior to and after the shooting which
 suggested they had no orders to shoot unarmed protesters, only
 using lethal force to protect themselves against rioters armed
 with lethal firearms and shooting at them Just as I have
 recorded enough accounts from people from the Maidan including
 a former opposition MP at that time who said going on an armed
 offensive was never the plan There s enough material for a book,
 which I may write one day On the evening of February 20, my sound man and I went for a
 quick grocery run We hadn t eaten for almost 30 hours by that
 point, as it was too dangerous to get out of the hotel On our
 way back we saw doctors carrying the dead towards the Maidan
 square for a vigil One, two, seven ¶we counted at least 13
 bodies One of those looked like it had been decapitated, or hit
 with a high caliber rifle in the head By then, large parts of
 Maidan were covered with dead bodies Most of these people were
 unarmed when they were killed, but there is still no definite
 answer as to who pulled the trigger Who wanted this blood? I fear that we will never know At least
 the unwillingness to investigate it suggests that this may be a
 very well guarded secret But I can make this promise here 
 while I m alive, I will not stop looking for answers to this
 question Not only because on that day I lost my Ukraine, which I
 had loved so dearly But first and foremost because I feel that I
 have a moral obligation to the families of those who lost their
 loved ones on that day so that they would finally know the
 truth Someday Aleksey Yaroshevsky,

 does this admission say about the US role in the Ukrainian

 says is the President can t get a story straight There are
 probably a bunch of people having a heart attack in the State
 Department when he said that, but essentially it s true What I
 wonder is if it s true on a different level than we even know 
 Maybe the deal we brokered is something that the President and
 the US State Department was doing behind the scenes while the EU
 was engaged in negotiating with Yanukovich, in negotiating this
 sort of a transition of power away from the President As we know
 that night was a very mysterious night Everyone went to bed

 30, 2014 The sentence the Navalny brothers got is too soft, according to a
 ruling United Russia party MP Mikhail Markelov called on the
 court to review the case and come up with a tougher penalty He
 has reminded that Oleg Navalny was a civil servant while working
 for the state owned Russia Post In this country quite a few lower level officials are
 serving jail sentences for less grave crimes, like abuse of
 power, ù he said Navalny was found guilty of
 embezzlement and money laundering Any other official in his
 place would have got eight to 12 years [in prison] ù The criminal case was initiated after managers from cosmetics
 giant Yves Rocher accused Navalny of major embezzlement in
 December 2012 The executives claimed the activist together with his brother,
 a senior manager in a subsidiary of the state enterprise Russian
 Post tricked them into signing a transportation contract with
 Oleg Navalny s own company at inflated prices This company allegedly never provided the services, but instead
 relied on a subcontract executed by other firms The scheme
 worked for four and a half years The overall amount of money paid by Yves Rocher to the brothers
 exceeded 55 million rubles (over US$1 6 million at the time) and
 the pocketed margin was over 20 million rubles ($600,000),
 according to the claim Additionally the brothers were accused of
 laundering the money with the help of a different family
 enterprise Officially charged with 30 million ruble (US$518,000) fraud and
 money laundering, Navalny has been under house arrest since
 February He was banned from using the internet and other means
 of communication, but continued to update his popular
 anti corruption blog by proxy of his wife READ
 MORE: Court puts Navalny under house arrest Earlier in December, Russian prosecutors asked that Aleksey
 Navalny be sentenced to 10 years in prison, and also sought to
 sentence his brother Oleg to eight years behind bars Navalny has
 claimed his innocence on all charges, stating that the scheme was
 an ordinary go between business Navalny has repeatedly stated that the criminal cases against him
 were instigated by the authorities as revenge ù for his
 anti corruption activism and forays into political opposition Some regard Navalny as an instrument of the West The idea
 behind promoting Aleksey Navalny is to make him a political
 matter, then to place high stakes on him and maybe to use him as
 a tool for an orangerevolution in Russia, political
 analyst Aleksandr Selivanov told RT, while saying the image of
 the activist was artificially constructed by the
 Western media Back in 2013, Navalny received a five year probationsentencefor taking part in a graft scheme involving

"9 Dec, 2014",Russia marks Heroes‚Äô Day with nod to Tsarist era,"Heroes Day sees Russians honor people awarded that title throughout history Heroes of the Russian Federation and Soviet Union, and those decorated with the Order of St George, the top award of the Russian Empire The latest honorary title Hero of Russian Federation was
 instituted in 1992, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the abolition of the Hero of the Soviet Union Since then,
 over 1,000 people have been awarded the title, most military
 servicemen, though not exclusively One example is Andrey Lamanov, an airline pilot who in 2010managed to land his dysfunctional jeton an
 abandoned runway in northern Russia that had been maintained by a
 local resident simply out of his sense of duty The plane rolled
 off the runway and into fields, but no one of the 72 people on
 board was injured in the accident Lamanov was named a Hero of Russia title and got a Gold Star
 medal for his feat The rest of the crew were awarded Orders of
 Courage Channel One television reports that despite pleas from
 his relatives, Lamanov refused to end his aviation career and
 continues to fly the very same plane he crash landed to this day The Defense Ministry announced solemn events all over the
 country Servicemen met with decorated veterans and wreaths were
 laid to monuments to soldiers who died in various wars that
 Russian has fought throughout its history The holiday itself was instituted in 2007 and its name the Day
 of Heroes of Fatherland was chosen because it is dedicated to
 everyone who received the highest awards from the Russian
 authorities The date chosen for the holiday is that on which the
 Russian Empire honored those decorated with the order of St 
 George The order was instituted in 1769 by Empress Catherine the Great,
 and many Russian military men generals, officers and simple
 soldiers received it for personal valor demonstrated in combat 
 The order was abolished after the October Revolution of 1917,
 along with other Tsarist decorations, but in 2000 the Russian
 President returned it, and since then 14 people have received the
 award The ribbon of St George burnt orange and black was
 transformed into the symbol of guards units in the soviet
 military and in mid 2000s Russian people re adopted it as the
 symbol of military glory and unity of the people of the Russian
 Federation ",https://www.rt.com/russia/212723-russia-heroes-holiday-history/
"28 Nov, 2014",‚ÄòForeigners at the helm of Ukraine means much more chaos‚Äô,"Instead of resolving problems with his citizens Ukraine s president is engaging with foreigners and serving their interests, which might lead to a systematic crisis and unrest, Anna Van Densky, political commentator for the EU Reporter magazine, told RT READ MORE: Poroshenko aims to change laws to
 allow foreigners into Ukrainian govt RT:What do you think of this development?
 How acceptable is it for foreigners to work as national
 lawmakers? Anna Van Densky:First of all it is not a
 completely new experience for Ukrainians because previously they
 had an American First lady The wife of President [Viktor]
 Yushchenko was an American So they knew how it feels But if
 they look at the other countries of the post soviet space they
 see that it happened in Georgia, they had a minister of foreign
 affairs who was a French citizen, they even had a President of
 Latvia who was a Canadian citizen, and today President [Toomas
 Hendrik] Ilves is an Estonian American It is not something
 completely new But of course it is very sad news for regular
 Ukrainian citizens because it means that the government will
 pursue not only the interests of oligarchs but also of
 foreigners It means it will be much more chaos than before RT:They ve also said American and German
 citizens could be up for the jobs Do you have any particular
 candidates in mind? AVD:I read the headlines and they said that
 there will be certainly a Georgian who will be the prominent
 figure in the government My guess that it is Mr [Mikhail]
 Saakashvili but probably I m wrong I think that the idea to
 engage so many foreigners at such a crucial moment in the history
 of the country because President Poroshenko should engage with
 his own citizens Now there is anti terroristic
 campaign ùwhich is going on de facto in spite of the Minsk
 agreement That is the major failure he should resolve And
 instead of resolving problems he has with his own citizens he
 starts to engage foreigners serving their interest It is
 dramatic because that would create a systematic crisis leading to
 the next civil unrest or maybe a revolution again The Maidan
 revolution was the second, next to the orangerevolution we ve
 already faced And also we ve had anti corruption slogans But
 they never came true I am afraid very much that now there are
 plenty of slogans but the reality is grim because oligarchs and
 multinationals are serving their own interests and the only loser
 is the regular Ukrainian citizen RT:The president has made it clear several
 times that Ukraine needs money But it s got an IMF loan; they ve
 been asking Washington and the EU for more So where is the money
 all going, when they don t even have the cash to provide basics
 for their own soldiers? AVD:Of course we all would love to know where
 this money goes We suppose they go to some corrupted
 individuals There is also a black market, for example in
 armaments and weaponry now That is the biggest problem: who is
 stealing money and how to fix a problem when the political
 opponents are removed What happens now: the political opponents,
 the people who didn t accept the coup d √©tat, they didn t accept
 President Poroshenko, let s say self ascendance, these people in
 Donbass region are excluded from the political process It is a
 very difficult situation and I m afraid that it will lead to
 further systemic crisis in Ukraine There is no good to come for
 Ukrainian citizens because previously international institutions
 also were borrowing money But it didn t do any good because as
 we know the population of Ukraine is extremely poor and it is
 impoverished even more by the latest politics, I mean that
 anti terroristic campaign of President Poroshenko Alexander Mercouris, International Affairs
 Editor for Russia Insider, agrees with Van Densky on the money
 issue and the controversy of the bill in Ukraine which will allow
 the appointment of foreigners to top government positions It s a strange thing to do, ùhe said, adding that it is
 unlikely that Kiev has already got any particular candidates RT:The president has made it clear several
 times that Ukraine needs money They ve got an IMF loan; they ve
 been asking Washington and the EU for more So where is the money
 all going? AM:The problem is they are not getting
 any money The IMF loan which was talked about apparently there
 isn t going to be any more money from the IMF until next year It
 is becoming increasingly difficult to say where Ukraine is going
 to find the money to cover its bills Some people are saying it
 needs about $20 billion over the next six months That is a huge
 amount of money to just keep rolling on At the moment it just
 isn t seen to be coming from anywhere The EU has said already it
 is not going to provide any more, Washington has not being
 forthcoming RT:Poroshenko s party has announced it s
 contacted a large head hunting company to look for the
 candidates What do you think of that? How acceptable is it for
 foreigners to work as national lawmakers? AM:I m afraid it is going to reinforce the idea
 that, firstly, there are problems within Ukraine about setting up
 with government and finding competent people, and also that
 Ukraine is increasingly coming under control of outsiders from
 Europe and the United States RT:Do you think they ve got particular
 people in mind here? AM:I think it is unlikely that they have got a
 particular candidate because if they had we would have probably
 heard about that by now RT:Ukraine has never hid its aspirations to
 join NATO and the EU, hoping it s almost through the doors But
 the German foreign minister has said it s not going to happen 
 Where will all these lead to? AM:I think that Ukrainian authorities probably
 know that already but they are not communicating the fact to most
 Ukrainians They are persisting with a policy that has never been
 a viable one It has always been clear to people who have
 observed the situation closely that Ukraine is not going to join
 NATO and it is not going to join the EU anytime soon And yet
 there is that constant pretense in Ukraine that it is And we see
 a bill is now going through the parliament to change the
 constitution, to remove Ukraine s non alien status, so that they
 can one day join NATO We see the Germans saying that isn t going
 to happen And it is not just the Germans, the French, the
 Italians have said it, lots of people have said it The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/209735-ukraine-bill-conflict-poroshenko-government/

Since 1991, the country has been completely divided along geographical lines Under its new borders of control should they become permanent western Ukraine and Kiev will have the upper hand for the foreseeable future It s also possible that, for this same reason, Russia could ultimately come to regret any moves to help the eastern provinces secede After the tumult of the winter, Ukraine needed a huge injection of aid Instead, it got strict IMF loans, which must be repaid Following the summer s conflict, it required a Marshall plan type strategy huge transfers from its notional allies ù This hasn t happened and even the latest installment from the IMF is delayed Such practice nails the illusion that joining the US led camp will result in an immediate improvement in living standards In fact, in Ukraine s case national wealth meager as it was has been destroyed in 2014 This will doubtless be of concern to countries like Moldova and Serbia who are wrestling with similar issues to those Kiev faced in recent years Since 2007, Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia won t tolerate any more NATO expansion In 2008, the interregnum President Dmitry Medvedev sent Russian soldiers into Georgia in response to provocations from Tbilisi which was flirting with the alliance When Ukraine seemed destined to enter the US led camp, Russia quickly facilitated Crimean citizens to reunify with Moscow Of course, this was in response to a strong desire within the peninsula who had actually first voted to leave Ukraine over 20 years ago Nevertheless, it was also a strategic move Under no circumstances was the Kremlin willing to countenance the loss of its naval bases in Crimea never mind allowing NATO to establish its own The image of John McCain, the failed US presidential candidate who wields significant influence in the Senate, standing shoulder to shoulder with Svoboda activists in Kiev is extremely telling Svoboda would be a prohibited organization in most of the Western world If they were Slovakian or Hungarian, for example, there would be absolute uproar Yet, in the name of giving Russia a jab, McCain and the US establishment can stomach supporting Svoboda Not to mention, failing to censor the Ukrainian loony fringe, Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) This suggests that Washington will get into bed with any form of extremists if it weakens Russia The problem with such a policy? If you lie down with the dogs, you wake up with the fleas There are only two countries in the world that the USA fears Russia and China Russia because it is the only nation that can destroy the American homeland China, due to its sheer volume of people and economic heft While Moscow is not a huge economic power (only 4 5% of global GDP), the military hardware it inherited from the USSR can wipe out the US Of course, the US can also remove Russia from the map However, both outcomes are entirely pointless Hence, the world would be a much safer place if the Kremlin and the White House negotiated new rules ù and the neocons were put out to pasture In China s case, any conflict is unthinkable Any violent engagement between Beijing and the US (or Russia) would result in unimaginable loss of life There is a powerful lobby in the Kremlin lead by Medvedev who desire closer relations with the West Indeed, there are even some who might like to join the EU or (shock! horror!) NATO if it were possible Contrary to western media projections, Russia is not some totalitarian state where dissenters are taken out the back and shot Instead, Moscow s politics are full of debate on policy Putin himself attempted to integrate Russia with the West in his first term His advances were rebuffed by extremists in Washington and some EU members who distrusted the Kremlin Now, due to Western actions, Putin has been forced to quickly ally with China This should be Europe s worst nightmare as it creates two distinct global power blocks, leaving the EU even more subordinate to Washington, and strengthens Beijing s chances of replacing the US as the world s leading actor The fact that nobody is debating it in Brussels is beyond comprehension Not to mention that Europe is extremely dependent on Russia s resources and Moscow on EU cash What should be a natural alliance is becoming a rivalry This doesn t make any logical sense Europe is in big trouble Germany is increasingly dominating the union economically at the expense of other members The south and east are economically banjaxed and only Ireland and France have positive birth rates Even with immigration, Germany s population is forecast to fall in the coming decades Only Ireland s is expected to rise significantly Ireland has only 5 million people so the efforts of its women are not going to save the continent The scale of the looming demographic crisis is exemplified by Lithuania, which has lost 27% of its population since 1990 Essentially, the only thing keeping population figures from decline in the Western countries is the mass migration of the east s youth The same has been true of Russia for the past two decades except the migration has largely come from the former USSR Although the birth rate has finally passed the death rate in Russia, it needs to raise further to undo the damage done since 1991 Furthermore, the EU s second biggest military power and third strongest economy, the United Kingdom, appears to want out France s position is also becoming volatile as the nationalist Front National threatens to take power in coming elections Despite all this negativity, the fact remains that the EU is the richest place ù in the world Its total GDP is higher than that of both China and the US However, it has been incapable of translating this fiscal might into political or martial influence Due to the after effects of WW2, the most powerful member, Germany, is basically a US military colony Meanwhile, Britain s global influence has waned to the point of irrelevancy and France, while stronger than the UK, seems disinterested in asserting itself The obvious solution is an independent EU foreign policy and federal EU armed forces However, the chances of this happening remind one of an old joke There s 2 hopes, Bob Hope and no hope Spend the years of learning squandering Courage for the years of wandering Through a world politely turning From the loutishness of learning Samuel Beckett, Dublin magazine The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/209531-ukraine-maidan-beckett-protest/
"24 Nov, 2014","Not jumping for joy: Ukraine, a year later","Just over a year ago, thousands of Ukrainians took to Kiev s main square, angry at oligarchs and corruption But instead of Europe ù and prosperity, they got a coup, more oligarchy, and war During the three month people power ù spectacle in Kiev s
 Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti) that began on November
 21, 2013, one of the protesters favorite chants was Who
 doesn t jump is a Moskal ù (a derogatory term for Russians) 
 After three months of jumping ù which involved attacking the
 police, attempting to storm government buildings, and cheering US
 and European officials who came to support them, the protesters
 overthrew the legally elected president and establish their own
 government on February 22, 2014 It has been nine months since
 then and a whole year since the Maidan ù protests began; let s
 try to see what they ve been jumping ù for Much like the 2004 orangerevolution , ù the Maidan protest was an
 exercise in perception management Officially, the reason the
 protesters gathered was the government s balking at signing the
 EU accession treaty A TV, internet and social media campaign 
 the very name EuroMaidan ù was a Twitter hashtag coined by some
 clever PR professional got the people riled up against the
 government presented as corrupt, incompetent and selfish Was this so? Part of the problem with the EU treaty was that it
 demanded Ukraine restructure its entire apparatus of state and
 society to the Union s standards, which would have cost something
 like $19 billion a year for the next decade (perThe Telegraph) But Brussels was willing to
 offer a paltry $750 million ( 610 million) in loans Ukraine
 needed much more just to stay solvent It was, by all metrics, abad dealfor Ukraine Meanwhile, Russia was offering $15 billion in favorable loans 
 and warning that if Ukraine signed a treaty with the EU, that
 would mean breaking the free trade treaty it had with Russia (and
 several other countries), causing further economic losses But
 the Maidan organizers spun this as Russia trying to steal
 Ukraine s European future ù Early in December, EU s Foreign Policy Commissioner Catherine
 Ashton and US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland came
 to Kiev and met with the protesters, giving them encouragement 
 inNuland s case, distributing biscuits as a
 publicity stunt President Yanukovich s cabinet was challenged in
 the legislature but survived a no confidence vote easily But
 the Maidan refused to accept the outcome of this democratic
 process Yanukovich tried to appease them, offering the
 premiership to one of the protest leaders, Arseny Yatsenyuk The
 Maidan said no, as the original protesters gave way to masked,
 helmeted and armed thugs dubbing themselves the Right Sector 
 and wearing Nazi insignia On February 18, the protests turned violent After two days of
 violence that saw dozens of dead protesters and police videos
 of peaceful democratic protesters butchering police
 officers and setting them on fire were quickly banished from
 public view in the West Yanukovich gave in On February 21, he
 signed an agreement with the Maidan leaders, brokered by German,
 Polish and French foreign ministers, to call early elections and
 give a general amnesty to rioters The Right Sector refused to
 accept the surrender, and its activists stormed government
 offices the next day Celebrated in the West as a popular revolution for liberty and
 democracy, the Maidan was nothing of the sort Research by
 independent journalists has revealed that the funding for various
 non governmental organizations, ù citizen
 initiatives, ù and free media ù instrumental in
 mobilizing the Maidan rebellioncame from the United States Moreover, Nuland
 herself admitted in December 2013 that Washington had spent $5
 billion since 1991 to secure and prosperous and democratic
 Ukraine ù What that translated to in practice is bestdescribedby columnist Brendan O Neill,
 writing three days after the February 22 coup: we have just
 witnessed European and American leaders remove an elected
 politician and replace him with a friendlier new
 government ù In late January, Nuland would be caught discussing how to
 midwife this thing ù with the US Ambassador to Kiev Geoffrey
 Pyatt, and having somechoice wordsfor the EU Yet even though our man
 Yats ù was indeed appointed Prime Minister after the February
 coup, Nuland s admission about her country pulling the Maidan s
 strings has gone persistently unmentioned in the Western press The coup was not the end, but just the beginning of Ukraine s
 agony As Right Sector thugs went around brutalizing dissenters
 and intimidating legislators and the media, the new government
 proposed a law outlawing the use of Russian Crowds gathered in
 multiple cities in the south and east of the country to protest
 the coup Crimea seceded in mid March, and was admitted to the
 Russian Federation within days In the eastern regions of Donetsk
 and Lugansk, the local population declared independence But
 while Washington and Brussels previously demanded Kiev refrain
 from violence against the Maidan, they fully endorsed a violent
 crackdown on these protests On May 2 in Odessa, pro junta militants attacked demonstrators
 protesting the coup, surrounding them at the Trade Union House
 and setting it on fire Official reports tell of 42 people who
 died in the blaze Amateur video footage showed junta supporters
 shooting and beating to death people who tried to escape Western
 and junta loyal media spun this as clashes ù with pro Russian
 protesters ù A week later, junta militants opened fire on
 civilians in Mariupol On May 25, in this atmosphere of terror and intimidation, the
 presidential election called by the junta was won by Petro
 Poroshenko an oligarch Donetsk and Lugansk didn t vote they
 had held their own independence plebiscites earlier, with the
 overwhelming majority in favor Poroshenko promised Ukraine would
 get massive aid from the West $15 to $25 billion ù from the
 IMF, as he said in a Washington Postinterviewin April All Kiev actually got was
 $1 billion in US loan guarantees Just days after Poroshenko was anointed president, Kiev began a
 massive military offensive to crush the rebels in the east 
 Tanks, airplanes, artillery and eventually missiles were used
 against cities and civilians Thousands have died Yet the
 military could not crush the rebels militia, prompting anguished
 cries of Russian invasion by Kiev s spokesmen every week and
 dutifully echoed by the Western press and governments In mid July, a Malaysian passenger jet routed over Donetsk by the
 air traffic control in Dnepropetrovsk (seat of the notorious
 oligarch and junta supporter Igor Kolomoisky) was shot down Kiev
 and the West immediately blamed Russia outright, and then the
 pro Russian rebels , then abruptly fell silent after Moscow
 presented radar and satellite evidence showing the plane could
 only have been shot down by the government forces In August, the Kiev forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, with
 their trapped units surrendering en masse to the rebels or even
 escaping across the border to Russia By early September it
 looked like the rebels might take Mariupol The advance was
 halted by the September 5 ceasefire signed in Minsk An adviser
 to President Poroshenko has sincestatedthat Kiev ought to follow the example of Croatia in 1995, and
 storm the rebel republics once it had enough American political
 and military support Officially, the Minsk ceasefire has been holding Both Kiev and
 the rebels have held parliamentaryelectionsearlier this month; as usual, the
 West praised the former and condemned the latter But the war
 continues: over 300 people had died since the ceasefire went into
 effect, according to aUN reportfrom early October The same report
 cites the fighting had claimed at least 3,660 ù lives, while
 8,756 people had been injured and 375,000 displaced Some 40,000
 businesses were forced to shut down These estimates are almost
 certainly too low Recently released official figures put Ukraine s GDP as down by
 7 8% in 2014 However, considering that most of the country s
 industrial and mining output was in the now disputed regions in
 the east, Kiev has literally destroyed its revenue stream 
 Ukraine has unpaid gas bills, mounting loans, and almost no gold
 left (as recentlyadmittedby the Central Bank Governor
 Valeriya Gontareva) credible reports indicate all of Kiev s
 gold was taken to the US shortly after the February coup And what of the fabled EU agreement that supposedly started it
 all? The junta government signed the political part of it in
 March, while Poroshenko signed the economic portion in June but
 the whole thing has been put on ice till December 2015 Far from
 the promised phantom prosperity, it always stood to cause a
 great deal of pain and disruption ù (aBBCdescription) Ukraine wasn t able to handle it a
 year ago, before its society, economy and politics were destroyed
 by the coup and the civil war Leaders of the Maidan protests and their Western backers wanted a
 united Ukraine dominated by the anti Russian ideology of Stepan

 the renowned Ukrainian journalist, Mustafa Nayyem (who now sits
 in parliament) Lets meet up at 22:30 under the Independence
 monument Dress warm, bring umbrellas, tea, coffee, good mood and
 friends, he wrote It looked like a genuine invitation to a
 picnic One of my Ukrainian colleagues, who had spent a day with
 all of us in front of the Ukrainian parliament, frowned with
 disapproval Oh, c mon! Another protest, seriously? As if
 people still haven t realized this country cannot be changed by
 flag waving ù Oh boy, how wrong he was and all of us, for that matter We
 naively thought that this gathering, one of many, wouldn t change

 to what happened in Ukraine then, and what is happening there

 ago and my opinion does not necessarily reflect the opinion of
 my employer, the RT news channel This story is solely focused on
 that first Maidan, and I will write separately about the
 protest s later stages You may ask why was there such initial pessimism about the
 first Maidan? Because in the four years I had spent living and
 working in Kiev, I had seen a lot of such gatherings Always
 loud, always tense, but never fruitful Some may say, What
 about the orangerevolution ? Yes, undoubtedly it brought
 some result although I m not sure it was the result Ukraine was
 craving for And that is exactly why in February 2010 Viktor Yanukovich the
 man completely written off after his fiasco in 2004 came to
 power Legitimately elected by a majority of votes That is
 exactly why three and a half years later many desperately grasped
 on to the idea, which his predecessor Viktor Yushenko was fondly
 cherishing, but never fulfilled to sign an association
 agreement with the EU That is why angry people took to the
 streets again I remember feeling utterly surprised when the first talk of
 Yanukovich pushing through the EU association deal came up 
 although at the time I felt that government could not surprise me
 anymore Roughly a year into his presidency, it was already clear
 by then that Yanukovich was not a messiah, that he would not pull
 ties between Ukraine and Russia out of the mud, which Yushchenko
 had dragged them into Yes, investment from Russia had increased 
 Yes, some factories like the Antonov airplane factory had a
 second lease of life Yes, Yanukovich abolished the controversial
 and much maligned glorification of the 1940s Ukraine Insurgent
 Army a move that irritated both Moscow and many in Ukraine
 itself But it was evident that on an inter state level things were messy
 as well The total stalemate in talks to alter the gas price for
 Ukraine was ample proof of that Some even speculated whether
 Putin actually disliked Yanukovich on a personal level Some were
 more pragmatic that Yanukovich and his team were too ardent in
 pursuing their national, or personal, interests in talks with
 Moscow But from whatever side one looked at it, Yanukovich s
 push toward the EU made little sense considered as either a
 bargaining chip to use in negotiations with Moscow or as an
 attempt to rescue his fast falling approval ratings This
 decision looked particularly bizarre, considering Moscow made
 itself quite clear about the possible outcomes You probably have
 your own opinion on whether such a reaction was justified But I
 doubt many will question the fact that any country has the right
 to protect its economic interests Back then few thought let
 alone reported on it that in the case of the Ukraine market s
 total re orientation, Russia would have suffered a massive hit to
 its industry The damages could have been in the billions of
 euros Ukraine reached Maidan 2013 in a lamentable state Corruption 
 always strong since the fall of the USSR was at astronomical
 levels I knew a few people who lost their businesses after
 visits by thugs in leather jackets Even the brilliantly staged
 Euro2012 football tournament did not sweeten the bitter pill 
 the land which had had an uneasy economic and ethnic situation
 even before Yanukovich, was on the edge We sometimes spoke with
 colleagues of mine by colleagues I mean those working at
 Russian, Ukrainian and Western media about when it was going to
 go off Not if, but when When the riots in Vradievka happened,
 it felt just like the beginning of it It calmed down, but not
 for too long My work as the bureau s chief reporter in Kiev ended in November
 2012, right after the parliamentary elections I remember putting
 the case to management I felt that the election results almost
 guaranteed things would not become calmer That in six months we
 may see a genuine storm, a lot more serious than the ever present
 power in fighting in Ukraine (I mean endless dismissals of
 parliament, early votes, fistfights inside the Rada, blackmail) 
 But, on the other hand, going back to Moscow meant that Kiev was
 only an hour s flight away although I did not expect that I
 would be flying back and forth almost every two months And not
 even because I love Ukraine I still think that the time I spent
 there was the happiest in my life and not because I ve left so
 many friends and close people there Slowly but steadily, the
 revolution was boiling up there It leaked through minor civic
 upheavals and worsening of the economy I was wrong in my
 estimations only by six months On November 16, 2013, I went to the producers and expressed my
 concerns that this time it may be close to actually flaring up 
 That I had inside info don t ask where from, I ve had plenty of
 good sources in Ukraine then that the EU deal would not be
 signed Well, go there for 3 5 days, if nothing happens you
 can always do a couple of feature stories, was the
 response It s worth mentioning that by then the previously
 propaganda free (I hate the P word, but there s no other way of
 putting it) society in Ukraine was already bombarded with
 information on how the EU deal would change their lives more
 incomes, better standards of living, European values The full
 spectrum of clich√©s Globally, we were among the very few if
 not the only one media to report the other side of the story
 (and you can easily find my reports from that time online) That
 the association deal may only bring positive effects to ordinary
 Ukrainians in the long term after at least 20 years That the
 immediate blow to the country s economy could be devastating,
 particularly in machinery which almost entirely depended on trade
 with Russia That the EU association deal would not mean the
 country becomes a member of the EU any time soon (Turkey was and
 is a good example of that) We reported on that not because we
 wanted to discredit the EU, and not because we had a mission
 against Ukrainians But because those worries and concerns were
 expressed to us by renowned economists in Ukraine even those
 who thoroughly supported integration with Europe They also told
 us that Ukraine can and should have the best of both worlds 
 which it has been doing since the USSR ceased to exist 
 Nevertheless, people there didn t want to listen to us or them,
 as if they were blinded or obsessed with this EU deal Those,
 however, were the bunch who preferred to voice their stances from
 the comfort of their armchairs People who were ready to act had
 a slightly different opinion When I first came to that Nayyem inspired Maidan, I saw these
 people The people who knew very well that the EU doesn t want
 them for now But they also knew very well that they were fed up
 with living in a country like this They were of different intellectual and income levels students,
 journalists, poets, carpenters, managers, photographers, donut
 sellers All united by the wish to make their country better I
 shall repeat myself and I reported on this back then there
 was a clear understanding on that Maidan that the
 long sought after EU agreement would be just a formality That it
 will still have to be ratified by all EU members which seemed
 doubtful in the times of the Eurozone crisis That this agreement
 will first and foremost change the legislative basis in Ukraine,
 bringing it under European standards Not all actually understood
 what those standards meant, but the existing laws and, most
 importantly, not keeping them made people furious How can one
 criticize the people s will to aspire to a better life?
 Especially when they are not breaking any laws not blocking
 traffic, not ripping cobblestones from under their feet and are
 not arming themselves? I will say this everything happening at THAT Maidan back then
 was sweet and innocent Which did not apply to another ridiculous
 display at the nearby European Square literally 200 steps away 
 Another numerous rallies, filled with fiery speeches by the same
 old politicians Everything looked like one big Groundhog Day 
 except that people at those rallies may have got slightly more
 irritated than before Those protesting (although I m still not
 sure if its right to call them protesters) at the Maidan even
 spoke of figurative borders between them and those at the
 European we re here with no party flags, let them stay
 somewhere else It was quite telling, that the only clashes with
 the police at that time happened at the European square where
 political parties rallied There was nothing like that at the
 Maidan there were dialogues, there were guitar songs, there was
 faith in making things better And then all of a sudden 
 somebody decided to put paid to that with batons and raw
 strength When my cameraman called me at 5am with Where are you?
 Maidan was dispersed! ùI could not believe what I had heard 
 Who? What for? Why was the force used? Now, a year on, we can say
 many investigations of tragic events over that period have
 drowned in the whirlpool of the events Of course, I m not the only one who wants to know who fired
 sniper rifles at February s Maidan, what exactly happened in
 Odessa and what and who brought down MH17 We may never know But I still hope at least one thing becomes clear some day who
 ordered the use of force against a handful of students, who would
 have probably gone home in a few days anyway? It was that episode
 which changed everything In two days, a furious crowd of many
 thousands marched through the streets of Kiev The crowd which
 put the EU association deal far aside Police surrendered without
 a fight Maidan was immediately occupied, as well as the City
 Administration building A few hours later, first major clashes
 erupted by the presidential administration building For the
 first time in Kiev, me and my crew breathed and choked on pepper
 gas Something I never imagined could happen in wonderful Kiev 
 It was then that the mechanism of revolution bloodletting,
 cruel to both its heroes and its antagonists was activated It
 was then that the absolutely justified and long boiled rage of
 the people began to be transformed First, into a persistent
 several month long siege, and then to somebody s personal weapon
 to bring down the state To be continued Aleksey Yaroshevsky,

 currently over Ukraine Sadly, an us or them ù narrative emerged
 almost instantly and hasn t shown any signs of abating The US
 media is selling a menace of unreality to its readers and its
 Russian counterpart is little better Regrettably, in a time of
 almost unlimited information, the general public understands less
 than ever as spin replaces truth Another worrying development has been the emergence of shady US
 PR activists, masquerading as journalists, which dupe traditional
 media with tactics tested in the Middle East Unable to counter
 with facts, they resort to personal attacks if they find time
 after one sided nod fests ù purporting to be debates on
 Ukraine While it s clear that US politics features only two
 parties, which are different sides of the same coin, classic
 European debate is more varied and nuanced than the US style
 with us or against us ù narrative Even Russia, a
 nascent democracy, has a healthier culture of debate than the
 American mainstream If you get your news from Moscow, a group of fascist,
 Russia haters overthrew Ukraine s elected government earlier this
 year According to the Western corporate media, President
 Yanukovich fled in terror after his security services murdered
 innocent civilians in Kiev If you watched CNN this summer,
 freedom loving hipsters were fighting a war with dangerous
 terrorists in East Ukraine In Moscow, the government forces were
 terrorists and the rebels were the freedom fighters Confused? In
 the words of James Joyce: It made him very tired to think
 that way It made him feel his head very big ù The fact is that nobody knows who shot the protestors in Kiev,
 the US line is Yanukovich s forces, and German media blames
 pro Maidan Also, the proportion of neo Nazis at Maidan a b√™te
 noir for Russian TV was small, though noisy and highly visible 
 That is not to make light of their extremism, just to point out
 that the vast majority of, initial, protestors were campaigning
 for a better life, not the far right How horribly ironic that
 their, genuine, activism has actually helped to make life in
 Ukraine even worse than it was pre Maidan As for who are the terrorists? That s best left to Gerard
 Seymour: one man s terrorist is another man s freedom
 fighter ù Which media is 100 percent truthful in coverage of Ukraine?
 Probably none of them In a 24 hour broadcasting age, the facts
 are often the first casualty of the race to be first with the
 news Not to mention that no pretense of balance exists Why did Ukraine s fractious unity finally fall apart and why did
 an already impoverished state finally hit the bottom of the
 barrel? I think the answers to the death can be found in the
 birth Birth, it turns out, was the death of Ukraine Ukraine is not a nation in the sense that most of Europe is It
 doesn t have a common language or shared history, nor does it
 have a fixed historical territory In this sense it is analogous
 to Yugoslavia or the United Kingdom The separatist areas are
 akin to the Irish situation in the 1920 s, despite being part of
 the UK for a considerable length of time, the Irish would no
 longer accept London rule This was because they didn t feel
 British and had another culture and language People in Crimea
 and Eastern and Southern Ukraine feel the same towards Kiev While it may work as a federation which the UK has moved
 towards it doesn t work as a linear state Present day Ukraine
 was assembled by the USSR for logistical reasons Moscow wanted
 to link the industrial east with the southern ports and the
 agrarian west To facilitate this, huge movements of people took
 place For example, in Lviv, the western nationalist stronghold, a
 Polish majority were scattered to make way for rural Ukrainian
 peasants Only 70 years ago, Lviv (or Lvov) was the 3rd largest
 city in Poland and its second largest cultural and academic
 center, after Warsaw Conversely, the southern port of Odessa
 was, until a few generations ago, a city of the Jewish and
 Russian elite They dispersed to Israel, Moscow, America and
 provincial cities of the USSR Then, in 1991, the USSR collapsed and Ukraine lost its raison
 d √™tre Suddenly language issues and petty nationalism took over 
 Kiev, fancying itself as a strident global capital, began to suck
 cash from profitable eastern industry and the west fell into a
 torpor of mass unemployment and extremely low wages for those
 lucky enough to work This made finding muscle ù for Maidan
 rather easy For many of the young west Ukrainian activists ù 
 generally accepted to have been paid it was probably their
 first proper, well remunerated, job Another problem was that the central Ukrainian industrial base,
 around Dnepropetrovsk, Krivoy Rog and Kiev was largely beholden
 to the Soviet military industrial complex, for the most part
 inherited by Moscow This explains why Antonov the famed plane
 maker is currently on the verge of collapse Antonov like countless other Ukrainian companies simply
 cannot compete in western markets The Soviet system collapsed into oligarchy in both Russia and
 Ukraine The smaller pool of oligarchs in Kiev rivaled their
 Moscow brethren for opulence, ambition and wealth The snag was
 that the pot was much smaller in Ukraine and left little to be
 scattered to the populace In 1999, Russia got Putin, the state began to re centralize and
 many billionaires had their wings clipped This didn t happen in
 Ukraine Hence, in 2013, Ukraine was in a similar position to
 Russia in 1998 While reinvigorated Russia and the other
 significant neighbor, Poland, began to develop a middle class,
 Ukrainians were running to stand still and often sliding
 further behind The, ultimately, disappointing Orange ù revolution of 2004 had
 introduced the US, NATO and the EU into the Ukrainian fray In
 the years that followed, Kiev s kleptocratic elite, essentially,
 played the Western block off against Russia to get sweeter deals 
 By 2013, Yanukovich was in situ when the bluff was called and the
 Kiev cabal was forced to choose one or other The West wanted the
 President to sign an Association Agreement with the EU; Russia
 tried to cajole him into a new Eurasian Union ù Due to the
 divisions inside the state, either outcome was going to cause
 problems Who s to say that if Yanukovich had signed the EU deal
 that an alternative Maidan wouldn t have broken out in Kharkov or
 Donetsk? On the subject of Yanukovich, it s worth mentioning just how
 dreadful his regime was the conclusion of 20 years of
 state licensed robbery in Ukraine However, the kleptocracy
 wasn t confined to upper echelons; it snaked right down to
 primary schools and maternity hospitals While Yanukovich wasn t
 a pleasant ruler, Ukrainian corruption didn t start with him and
 it hasn t ended with him either It s endemic Once Kiev s Maidan protests started, it s obvious that a grouping
 within Washington s State Department sensed an opening and took
 full advantage Moscow s subsequent moves appear to have been
 reactionary rather than planned, but not excusable It s also
 likely that the Americans were surprised by how quickly momentum
 developed after they first got involved The end result is that Washington and Brussels are propping up an
 oligarchic regime led by Kiev and Lviv interests and that Moscow
 is stuck, for now at least, with a shattered eastern enclave
 which identifies as pro Russian Of course, the Kremlin also won
 the prize of Crimea, but that s not a free gift After 23 years
 of misrule, Crimea s infrastructure and economy is miles behind
 mainland ù Russia Upgrading would be costly, even without
 sanctions and economic turmoil For ordinary Ukrainians, the choice is stark Either stay at home
 and try to rebuild a viable state, or states, from a damaged
 carcass or leave for the far wealthier EU or Russia, if possible 
 As migrants, they will be a cheap, mostly disciplined and
 well educated labor force at home prospects seem grim One year

"3 Nov, 2014",‚ÄãDonbass election day ushers in ‚Äòthe real ceasefire‚Äô,"Kiev refuses to recognize the elections in eastern Urkaine but has not provoked any hostilities either The Donbass elections
 resulted in a predictable outcome, bringing victory to Alexander
 Zakharchenko, head of the Oplot battalion, who scooped more than
 70 percent of the votes Turnout varied from 65 percent to 100
 percent at 350 polling stations, where 1,148,000 people had
 registered to vote This election has been surprising in two ways First, not a single shot has been fired in Donbass since November
 2 a situation unseen since spring, including the ceasefire
 declared in early September after the Minsk talks Second, the most successful Donbass commander, Igor Bezler,
 handed in his resignation just before the election On Sunday, Alexander Zakharchenko made his first public
 appearance in a tieless shirt (instead of his military uniform) 
 Accompanied by his wife and a few dozen combatants, after casting
 the ballot he showed up to Lenin Square, where white trucks
 carrying humanitarian aid from Russia had lined up next to the
 Lenin Monument Previously, humanitarian cargos used to be
 unloaded outside warehouses by the railway Now the square is
 also a concert venue to celebrate the elections Whenever Zakharchenko goes, the militia cordon off the adjacent
 streets, causing annoyance to many But those who make it through
 his bodyguards can still approach him The self proclaimed Donetsk People s Republic has no president 
 Zakharchenko is the prime minister His deputy is IT professional Andrey Purgin Purgin is a smart, well educated man who moves around unescorted,
 walks often, and does not intend to change his habits When asked if what happened in Donbass was a left ù or
 right led ùrevolution, he said that right wing
 ideas dominated the revolution, and its soundtrack was Zhanna
 Bichevskaya s songs ù Zhanna Bichevskaya is a Soviet folk singer who borrowed a lot
 from Joan Baez in her singing style In the 1970s, she was the
 first performer in the USSR to sing songs of the White movement,
 who fought the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War She also sang
 numerous Russian folk and Cossack songs In the Soviet Union,
 many sought escape from ideology into music Many former Soviet
 citizens, including residents of Donbass, prefer to lament Soviet
 and imperial Russia s past rather than develop new ideas Our biggest problem is that our political class is too
 weak, ùsaid Purgin Too few people can generate ideas
 today Meanwhile, intellectuals are in self imposed isolation 
 Their only connection to this land is banknotes with Mazepa s
 portraits (Ivan Mazepa was a Cossack leader who opposed Peter the
 Great 300 years ago), and they do not remember the taste of
 victory ù He calls these intellectuals professional Russians ùAs
 the fighting began, they fled the country It is unclear who the winner is, ù said Purgin This sounds bitter and painful The Communist party was banned from the elections Only 20 years
 ago, Communists were the most popular party in Donbass Both
 left wingers and right wingers have yet to give proper wording to
 their ideas One can often hear people in Donbass say that militias oppose
 Ukrainian oligarchs, who are to blame for the bloodshed We are going to see large corporations grab seats in
 parliament vicariously, of course, ù added Purgin Looks like the time for ideas has yet to come in Donbass Purgin confirmed Igor Bezler s resignation He was a great
 commander But the active military phase is over, ùthe
 vice premier told me Purgin has put some unusual ideas on the agenda he wants to
 make the church as powerful as in Greece and Cyprus, with
 amendments to this effect to be enshrined in the region s
 constitution The church must be an additional arbitrator, an institution
 with authority that weighs in on issues, including ethical
 ones, ùhe explained The vacuum of ideas is the most startling thing about Donbass
 today, as all the banners as varied as imperialist and
 monarchist are gone six months after the May independence
 referendum All that s left is the black and orange St George s
 ribbon Polling stations look very much alike, the only difference being
 the number of windows shattered by the shockwave from explosions When we come to the city center, we see some stands outside a
 polling station with vegetables sold by local businessmen They
 don t charge much a kilo comes at a symbolic price of 1 hryvna
 (US$ 07) There is a line, but it s not longer than inside
 polling stations The Kiev district of Donetsk is closest to the city airport and
 has arguably suffered the most from relentless shelling The
 turnout is quite high, but the proximity to the strategic site
 has had its effect Security officers examine journalists IDs
 more carefully and the locals are more reluctant to speak of
 their experiences and pose for a photograph Raisa, 74, has cast her ballot Born in Donbass, she worked as a
 math teacher She doesn t have a vegetable patch near her home,

 pro West election outcome ù according to Reuters while TASS
 has reported that Russia will recognize the results ù
 After the turmoil of the last 12 months, anything approaching
 consensus from the rival factions circulating around Ukraine must
 be welcomed According to preliminary results, a certain amount of horse
 trading will now ensue as even the combined might of President
 Petro Poroshenko and outgoing Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk s
 parties fall short of an overall majority It s widely believed
 that Poroshenko will seek a constitutional majority (2/3rds) in
 order to enact anti corruption legislation and other policies he
 has prioritized With around 100 independents elected in single
 seat constituencies, that won t be as straight forward as most
 observers had envisaged After the euphoria of spring and summer,
 the hard slog starts now The anticipated far right surge didn t really happen Between
 them, Svoboda, Right Sector and The Radical Party mustered around
 13% In the rest of Europe, such a result would be widely
 condemned and alarm bells would ring loudly but, given what s
 happened this year in Ukraine, it s almost a relief Only the
 Radicals will enter parliament through the list system with a
 projected 22 seats while the other two will scrape around 7 from
 direct elections That gives the nutters ù around 10 percent of
 the actual seats While they won t wield much power, the infamous
 Rada fights should be more interesting, or alarming However, given that Yatsenyuk moved markedly to the right in
 recent months, it s likely that his People s Front hoovered up a
 fair amount of extremist votes The hope is that Yatsenyuk was
 merely doing this for electoral advantage and doesn t actually
 believe his own verbiage If it s the former, the PM might have
 done everyone a huge favor if the latter, it s time for a
 collective shudder How representative was the ballot of Ukrainian opinion? Oligarch
 Igor Kolomoisky s television network claimed that turnout was

 29, 2014 In previous elections, the west and east of the country were
 divided along party lines, this time most eastern voters didn t
 bother to attend a polling station Meanwhile, their western
 brethren enthusiastically embraced the process This is worrying Among those who did vote in southern and eastern regions, Yuriy
 Boyko s newly formed Opposition Bloc came from nowhere to perform
 stoutly Yet, in Kiev and the west, they barely got a preference 
 The divisions might be less obvious than before, but they still
 exist Boyko s party won all constituencies in Kharkov and
 Lugansk and 8 from 9 in Zaporizhia In Kolomoisky s
 Dnepropetrovsk stronghold they took 10 from 17 and in Odessa 4
 from 11, with Poroshenko s faction gaining the other 7 
 Poroshenko also secured 6 from 7 in Nikolaev These results suggest that while Kiev and the west strongly
 support a European direction for Ukraine, the central, southern
 and eastern regions are not, remotely, as positive The notion,
 propagated by most of the EU/US media, that all of Ukraine is
 united behind an EU dream is, patently, false Under a normal ù
 future turnout, these regions would, presumably, deliver an even
 stronger anti Western message However, without question, the pro Western camp has done
 spectacularly well If Ukraine s economy received sufficient
 support from Washington and Brussels, they might even solidify
 their gains Indeed, restive regions might, eventually, alter
 their stance and Ukraine could be firmly on the road to Europe 
 However, if ù has a long tail The problem is that neither the US
 nor the EU has shown a willingness to deliver cartloads of cash
 to Kiev Indeed, on Tuesday, Ukraine s outgoing finance minister,
 Alexander Shlapak, admitted that its unlikely ù that Kiev will
 receive the second tranche of a $17 billion IMF loan this year 
 It means that Ukraine has received only 760 million from the EU
 in 2014 This is peanuts Kiev s budget deficit is forecast to be
 around 15 billion For context, Britain is currently fighting with the EU about 2 1
 billion it owes and threatening to withhold it London, for the
 record, hasn t suggested sending it to Kiev either With such
 infighting in the current union, Ukraine is at the back of the
 queue with its begging bowl Brussels annual budget is 143
 billion, meaning that despite all of the nice verbal support for
 Kiev this year, they ve given around 0 5% to the embattled
 nation If support for Ukraine is measured on Jerry Maguire s
 show me the money ù metric, it would be charitable to describe it
 as lousy ù For Kiev to sustain support for its Western journey, it must
 deliver economic growth and raise living standards Not in 5 or
 10 years time, but now The last time Ukraine had a revolution ù
 (remember, the Orange one) in 2004, all the same promises were
 made Just a few years later, the losers ù of that revolt took
 power and that eventually led to the Maidan violence and
 subsequent civil war There is no doubt that the pro Brussels movement is better
 organized this time (and better funded on the ground) but the
 hard work has only begun Revolutions might be won with emotion
 but they are consolidated by cold, hard graft when everyone has
 sobered up Ukraine s morning after ù is long overdue and the
 hangover will be humongous If Brussels is serious, really serious about bringing Ukraine

 in elections at all levels from the age of 16 The minimum age of
 candidates would remain unchanged, 35 years for the President and
 21 years for State Duma deputies Didenko explained that modern young people are often much better
 informed about politics and the latest news than an average
 member of the public It is known that the younger generation is the main target
 of manipulators who operate with the orange ù technologies; they
 are the main backers for those who organize Maidan and
 Bolotnaya, ù the MP said Young people get involved in
 protests mainly because they have no election rights and cannot
 participate in political processes ù Orange ù or color ù revolution is a widely used
 term for vivid and intense street protest, usually over alleged
 violations at elections that lead to displacement of parliament
 and government in a country, like the situation in Ukraine in
 2004 and in 2014 The lawmaker says that dropping the voting age to 16 would
 significantly increase voter turnout He explained that as
 elections in Russia are held on a single voting day in
 mid September, adults and pensioners can be away from their homes
 for vacation and rest; young people however begin their studies
 on September 1 and will be definitely available to vote Didenko
 added that adults who shun the elections would start taking part
 in polls once they see their future is being decided by the
 young We will have a perfect balance the younger generation will
 get their voting rights and the older generation would become
 more disciplined, ù the lawmaker told reporters Didenko also quoted some international experience in the issue
 saying that Iranian citizens can vote from 15 years of age,
 Cypriots, Brazilians, and Cubans can vote at 16 and Indonesia
 sets the minimum voting age at 17 years This was not the first time the LDPR has suggested dropping the
 voting age and there is a good reason for this Statistics show
 that over 55 percent of students support LDPR in elections of all
 levels and leaders of the party have grounds to suggest that
 senior schoolchildren would demonstrate the same behavioral
 pattern However, the head of the Lower House Committee for Constitutional
 Law, Vladimir Pligin (United Russia), criticized Didenko s
 proposal, saying that it was normal and correct that the voting
 age matched the age of full civil and criminal responsibility
 which is 18 years in Russia Georgiy Fyodorov of the Russian Public Chamber also rejected the
 motion suggesting that young people would not be exercising their
 new right and this would only lower the turnout at elections The
 activist also said that in his view younger people were easier to
 cheat or bribe as they did not fully understand the value of
 their votes ",https://www.rt.com/russia/199707-russia-voting-age-lowered/

 Talk Anymore and Barack Obama just might be a Crazy Horse
 fan: I Don t Want To Talk About It ùwas one of their
 biggest hits and was later, with great commercial success,
 covered by Rod Stewart Vladimir Putin speaks fluent German,
 lived in the country for years and could enjoy the folksy Hofmann
 sisters, who are solidly traditional They had a smash with Ein Leid in Unserer Sprache ùwhich means, in English, Suffering in our language ù With the NATO backed Kiev regime having effectively lost the
 military attempt to retake the south east of Ukraine from
 Russian supported rebels, talking has become a necessity, but, I
 believe, it s more than Ukraine that needs to be discussed 
 Winston Churchill famously opined: To jaw jaw is always
 better than to war war ùand a lot more of the former is
 needed to avoid future conflict in the borderlands between the
 two powers When two big bears target the same berries, something
 has to give The biggest obstacle is that Western leaders, apparently, want
 Putin to apologize for events in Ukraine and to return Crimea,
 against the will of its people, to Ukraine It is clear that the
 Russian President has no intention of either and that he believes
 NATO created the problem by encouraging the Maidan protests,
 which led to the overthrow of the country s democratically
 elected previous government It is impossible to see how Putin can return Crimea the locals
 won t countenance it and it is also clear that the populace in
 Donbass and Lugansk are not going to accept direct rule from Kiev
 after the events of this summer They might submit to remaining
 inside the Ukrainian state if autonomy is agreed For their part, Western administrations appear unwilling to
 accept any responsibility at all for the disaster they fomented
 in Ukraine, despite the fact that their fingerprints are all over
 it Without NATO enlargement, driven by US ideological doctrine
 (shared by some European policymakers) to spread Western liberal
 values to a region where support for them is far from unanimous,
 there would have been no war That is a fact However, in this round of musical chairs, Obama is playing the I don t want to talk about it game He canceled a
 meeting slated for September of last year because of Russia s
 offer of asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and, together
 with other Western leaders, failed to turn up for June s G8
 summit in Sochi Indeed, despite all the horror and tension in
 Europe this year, the US President has not met face to face with
 his Russian counterpart since the June 2013 encounter at a G8
 summit in Ireland This could be forgiven in a time of stability but in a period
 where the entire world seems unhinged, with conflicts bubbling
 all over, a lack of personal contact between the leaders of the
 world s two largest military powers is irresponsible at best and
 downright dangerous at worst What makes it even more ridiculous is that outside of Ukraine
 there is much the pair might agree and cooperate on The Kremlin
 is likely equally concerned about Iraq s IS (Islamic State)
 nut cases and they could also, surely, work with Washington on
 Gaza and Iran, not to mention copious other disputes that are in
 danger of escalating Plainly, a lack of communication between
 Washington and Moscow is making the globe ever more dangerous So how do we get them in Buddy Holly mood, singing Words Of
 Love? ùObama and Putin must hold a summit to resolve the
 problems between NATO and Russia, which go back to Ukraine s
 membership of the alliance s (no, not a joke) Partnership
 for Peace program in 1994, but have accelerated since
 2004 s orangerevolution , which Moscow saw as an
 attempt to wrest Ukraine out of its orbit Why only Obama and not the other NATO leaders? ùI hear
 you cry This is simple, despite the charade in Wales this week,
 the USA is NATO and the organization is an extension of their
 foreign policy if Washington withdrew in the morning, the rest
 might as well go home The root of the conundrum is NATO s eastern expansion While
 Russia tolerated the accession of the Baltic States, after much
 protest, trusting a 1997 treaty prohibiting the Western alliance
 from basing large amounts of troops in the east, it is clear
 Moscow will not acquiesce to further eastward expansion It is
 also hazy as to how such moves benefit the US or Western Europe
 in the first place, offering security guarantees to largely 
 unstable and divided states that do not have a huge inclination
 for liberal political values Furthermore, Western elites seem dazed and confused by what has
 unfolded in Ukraine However, they were warned by serious
 thinkers in the 1990s that relentless expansion into Moscow s
 backyard would lead to collision with the Kremlin Then Russian
 President Boris Yeltsin cautioned: When NATO comes right up
 to the Russian Federation s borders the flame of war could
 burst out across the whole of Europe ù Yet, they didn t need to look all the way to Moscow for advice 
 At home, George Kennan, the greatest American Kremlinologist of
 the 20th century, warned I think it is the beginning of a
 new cold war There was no reason for this whatsoever (NATO
 expansion) No one was threatening anybody else ù It shows so little understanding of Russian history and
 Soviet history Of course there is going to be a bad reaction
 from Russia, and then (the NATO expanders) will say that we
 always told you that is how the Russians are but this is just
 wrong, ùhe added In Britain, Tony Judt, the pre eminent historian of his
 generation, wrote a seminal essay in 1995, The Grand Illusion ù,
 and in 2009, a year before his death he again counseled: Russia is a great power in areas that matter to us Russia
 borders on Iran, Russia borders on Turkey well, not literally,
 but across the seas Russia borders, much more importantly, on
 all the former Soviet states going right past Afghanistan and up
 to the Chinese border, which are the most volatile, most likely
 to matter to the US on issues of terrorism, the Taliban,
 Al Qaeda ù You can t conduct your foreign policy toward Russia on the
 basis of Polish attitudes or, indeed, Georgian attitudes, ùcontinued Judt Despite all these warnings, factions within the US administration
 would not relent and their activities eventually led to the
 carnage in Ukraine Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of
 state for European and Eurasian affairs, estimated in December
 2013 that America had invested more than $5 billion since 1991 to
 bankroll pro Western movements in Russia s neighbor Now,
 Ukraine s fragile unity is shattered, thousands are dead and Ian
 Bremmer, of New York s Eurasia Group, is warning that the
 country s economy will collapse ùWashington s meddling
 has turned a poverty stricken, dysfunctional state into a failed
 one Many Western commentators now contend that other east European
 countries close to Russia are in danger from the Kremlin s ambitions nations Judt labeled the cassandra
 states ù In my view, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania s concerns have some
 validity They are bordered by a huge military power, which was
 the largest entity in the multi national Soviet Union, which once
 effectively colonized them Due to understandably painful
 memories of that era, there is little doubt that Western
 propaganda, by creating alarmism, could stir feelings of
 endangerment However, nothing in Russia s behavior suggests any aggression is
 imminent and Moscow understands that any attack would lead to
 World War Three, due to US guarantees on their security Only a
 madman would risk a nuclear war to subsume three tiny countries,
 which despite large ethnic Russian minorities, are largely
 harmonious Vladimir Putin is not mad To get an understanding of Russia s feelings towards NATO, I
 spoke to a senior Kremlin official who said: We are not
 interested in confrontation at all We prefer negotiations rather
 than hostilities Nobody is thinking to attack the Baltics why
 on Earth would we do it? But when we see military buildup on our
 Western borders we feel that this buildup is against Russia 
 Remember, the last time an attack came from the West in 1941, it
 took 27 million Soviet lives All the major invasions (Hitler,
 Napoleon, Poles) came from the West that is why we are
 genetically fearful about this alliance Having this powerful potential at our borders leaves us
 feeling unprotected We feel a kind of invasion could be
 initiated by the Americans from the Baltic territory so this
 leads us to the conclusion that the military bases in the Baltic
 could be used in the future against Russia, ùthe source
 added Essentially, the East European states fear Russia, and Russia
 fears NATO With all this trepidation swirling around, Europe has
 become destabilized Hence, the only solution is to remove the
 panic before the general angst turns into full blown anxiety To achieve this, Obama and Putin will have to'jaw jaw'and NATO and Russia must set new parameters on the world order 
 this could include talks on nuclear armaments and other mutual
 concerns to boot The West needs Russia for many reasons, as Judt
 said, and Russia needs the West to continue its economic revival
 and modernization Russia is not the Soviet Union, and much of
 Washington s and US media thinking is fastened in that era Modern Russia is far from a closed country, it s a vital cog in a
 global trading wheel and the age of sanctions risks dragging
 Europe into the economic abyss with Russia also, despite its
 access to Asian markets, seriously harmed Additionally, the new distrust between Moscow and the West, if
 unchecked, could, feasibly, lead to another cold war, which no
 rational person could desire During his last election campaign, Obama famously sang Al Green s Let s Stay Together ù the president will also recall
 that Green sang talk to me say something good to me ùObama ought listen to the Reverend and ignore Crazy
 Horse because not talking about it has plummeted NATO Russia

 National Security and Defense Council Secretary (NSDC), ù
 Parubiy wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday However, he did not explain his reasons I consider it
 unacceptable to comment on the resignation during the war, ù
 he wrote citing the crisis in southeastern Ukraine Regarding his future plans, he wrote that he will continue
 dealing with the issues of providing assistance to the front,
 primarily to volunteer battalions ù Poroshenko s spokesman said on his Twitter account that Parubiy
 will stay on the presidential team ù The president accepted Parubiy s resignation, speaking of it at a
 meeting with the heads of the NSDC departments on Thursday Poroshenko thanked the former security chief for his work in
 the darkest days of the existence of our country, ù and for
 taking decisions that helped the country survive, ù said
 the president s statement on his website On Monday, reports appeared in Ukrainian media about Parubiy s
 resignation The Local Zn ua website, citing its source, said
 that the security chief is due to resign due to diverging
 opinions with the country s president The media stated that
 Parubiy decided to resign after he was ordered to declare another
 ceasefire in Kiev s military operation in the southeast of the
 country, but he refused to do so Kiev s bloody eastern Ukraine campaign LIVE
 UPDATES Parubiy was appointed secretary of the NSDC on February 27 by
 then acting President Aleksandr Turchinov, following the
 government coup in the country The former security chief gained
 a reputation during the Maidan protests in Kiev he was the
 commandant of Euromaidan self defense from November last year Parubiy was also one of the initiators of the creation of the
 country s National Guard forces, which are currently involved in
 Kiev s punitive operation in the southeast As Secretary of the
 NSDC, Parubiy oversaw this military operation He has been a political activist since 1991, when he founded the
 Social National Party of Ukraine together with Oleg Tyagnybok 
 The party promoted radical nationalism with neo Nazi features,
 such as a Wolfsangel ù on its first logo In 2004, the party
 changed its name to Svoboda (Freedom) and since then has been
 headed by Tyagnybok It has been often characterized as far
 right Parubiy co led the orangerevolution in 2004 and was
 rewarded for his contribution READ MORE: Police & activists clash on

"4 Aug, 2014","‚ÄòBehavior of Kiev government is worthy of a banana republic, not a European state‚Äô","Ukraine s President Petro Poroshenko discovered the new Constitution doesn t suit him, so he needs to purge Parliament, and ban the Communist Party, John Laughland, director of studies at Institute of Democracy and Cooperation, told RT RT:Petro Poroshenko called some of the parliamentary factions a
 fifth column that undermines the government s policies Also, the
 Communists were recently ousted from the parliament Will we now
 see another political lynching? John Laughland:Of course there is How ironic,
 because the EuroMaidan ùrevolution was predicated on
 the idea that the powers of the President of Ukraine should be
 drastically reduced in favor of those of the Parliament, and the
 very moment when President Yanukovich was overthrown on February
 21, the very next day Parliament voted itself new powers in time
 to go back to the 2004 Constitution Now the new President
 Poroshenko discovers that actually this new Constitution doesn t
 suit him, so he needs to purge the Parliament, he needs to
 stigmatize people who don t agree with his policy as fifth
 columnists, he needs to ban the Communist Party And above all,
 he and his cronies, the government itself, the Prime Minister and
 other ministers, they are of course trying to wreck the elections
 by changing the electoral law in advance of the polls so that
 they get the Parliament they want It s obvious that it is worthy
 of a banana republic, that is not worthy behavior of a European
 state RT:Will the President now try to form a
 parliament that will basically pass anything he tells them to?
 And could a parliamentary overhaul be just an attempt to shake
 off responsibility for recent decisions such as the military
 operation? JL:It s difficult to say Obviously the large
 part of the answer to that question depends on what will happen
 to the Party of the Regions It was decapitated in February, it
 hasn t yet found a new leader who is capable of taking things
 forward, and part of its electorate doesn t want to belong to
 Ukraine anyway and is engaged in a civil war That will be the
 decisive factor to what extent the Yanukovich party will be
 able to bring it together and fight the elections in any
 meaningful sense Obviously, the new power will put every single
 obstacle in its way But I think it is very important to
 emphasize as we saw in last week s fake resignation of Prime
 Minister Yatsenyuk, that there are of course divisions not only
 between East and West, between pro and anti Russians in Ukraine,
 but also within the pro Western fraction itself, between the
 Udar, the Svoboda and the Fatherland parties We know from the
 orangerevolution in 2004 that this coalition fell apart after
 year or so, will the same thing happen this time again, that s
 one of the other things we need to watch RT:The country s Prime Minister tried
 resigning around a week ago, but failed In your opinion, was it
 a PR stunt or a real attempt to distance himself from the power
 elite? JL:I think basically a lot of Ukrainian
 politics is explained by money and obviously the war is costing
 money, Ukraine is on the brink of default and some of the
 political parties who are controlled by oligarchs let s not
 forget the role of oligarchs is absolutely key in Ukrainian
 politics perhaps started to cut up a bit difficult about paying
 for this war Yatsenyuk, when I said fake resignation, it was a
 classic parliamentary maneuvering in a sense that he made the
 vote for new money for the war a matter of confidence and
 therefore, put his own job on the line and thereby managed to get
 these dissident parties back on board Let s see how long it
 lasts, let s see how long it takes for this heteroclite coalition
 to stay in place It did not last long in 2004; it fell apart
 after year and a half It may well last for another few months in
 Ukraine but in long term prospect we have to wait and see The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/177768-ukraine-poroshenko-constitution-tensions/

 on informing Russian citizens on the methods of Western
 propaganda that seeks to disrupt the constitutional order in the
 country and forcefully overthrow the lawfully elected
 authorities, the activists told the mass circulation daily
 Izvestia The council s founders claim they possess information that after
 the nearest all Russian election day on September 14,
 anti government activists will launch their own committees and
 headquarters for organizing street protest and other actions

 to Russia could be a sign that the information war will move on
 to Russian territory The head of the Institute of Political Research, Sergey Markov,
 agreed that though there was no immediate threat of revolution in
 Russia, the future situation was not safe, as the party of war ù
 in Washington was not hiding its desire to repeat the Kiev
 scenario in Moscow Markov also noted that the new anti fascist committee should
 study the statements of leading politicians and activists in
 order to establish their attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis

"24 Jul, 2014",'West projects Russia's Soviet past onto the situation in Ukraine'," There is no simple answer to the question why everyone is attacking and demonizing Russia, but it definitely will not lead to compromise, Professor Neil Kent, member of the Cambridge Initiative for Security Studies, told RT Russia s past, when it was pilloried as a totalitarian state, is
 still projected onto the present day, because people do not have
 an accurate understanding of what is going on, Kent said RT:When flight MH17 crashed, leaders in the
 US and the EU immediately pinned the blame on Russia Is the
 media being encouraged by them? Neil Kent:I would rather say that the media has
 its own agenda, to have a good story and have a priori
 convictions For example, I noticed in the last few days that one
 of the Pussy Riot women was writing about this whole tragedy To
 have Pussy Riot write a cool analysis of such an event seems to
 me like having Assange write about the Swedish legal system That
 sort of polemic is not what is needed to understand what has
 happened in such a tragedy RT:A couple of days ago, the US State
 Department said the American military would provide conclusive
 evidence How decisive is the intelligence made public so
 far? NK:To say it in one word, inconclusive I did
 jury duty in England a while ago and it was a case of someone
 stealing a rubber duck It took a fortnight to get to the bottom
 of that If it took two weeks to get to the bottom of someone
 stealing a rubber duck from a garden center how much longer would
 it take to get to the bottom of such a difficult situation? I
 think, having conclusions on the basis of films, videos,
 recordings, and deciding virtually immediately who the culprit
 is, is not the way to go about it At Cambridge where I am based
 cool analysis is considered extremely important RT:Most of the accusations target Russia
 and Vladimir Putin Why do news outlets think Moscow has such
 close ties to the militias in east Ukraine? NK:I think there are certainly those in the
 media who want sanctions, and there are those in government who
 want sanctions One of the things that intrigued me is that
 amongst the old traditional English establishment, centered
 around St James s in London, pillar of industry and land owners,
 people have come up to me rather sheepishly saying why is
 everyone attacking and demonizing Russia? And I do not have a
 simple answer to that I do not see why it is happening because I
 do not see that as a useful way of analyzing the situation or
 achieving happy results and compromises for everybody concerned RT:In your opinion, could all this media
 hype help those in the EU pushing for the imposition of economic
 sanctions on Russia? NK:Unfortunately in England there is what one
 of our Cambridge group calls historic attention span deficit
 syndrome , and by that they mean that people don t have an
 accurate historical background to the whole situation And since,
 for quite a long time Russia (in the Soviet period and even
 tsarist phase) has been pilloried as being an absolute
 dictatorial, vicious, totalitarian system I think it is
 projected onto the present day, because people do not have an
 accurate and objective understanding of what is going on There
 is not often a cool analysis of the situation in Russia on the
 ground or indeed in Ukraine, in Crimea RT:Why do you think Kiev s military
 operation in eastern Ukraine is being praised by Western leaders
 and the media? NK:One has to look back at the Orange
 revolution in Ukraine, the so called Arab Springs all over the
 Arab world, none of which turned out to be a spring, they d
 turned out to bring a new winter with the elimination of
 Christians from large swathes of the Middle East, and death and
 destruction Part of that is caused by ignorance about the
 situation and an incredible naivety People would like to imagine
 that in foreign cultures, particularly in England and America,
 people have the same values and react the same way they do at
 home And they somehow project there the new American Revolution,
 the tide that happened in 1774 in the US as a result of a coup 
 This wonderful new idyllic state will rise up from the ground and
 lambs and the lions will live in harmony ever after And I think
 it is sad, because I will never forget how at the beginning of
 this situation I heard the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox
 Church saying to people: Please, everyone, all my flock, in
 Ukraine, in Russia, wherever you are, do not take up arms against
 one another, sit down and speak to one another and negotiate 
 Somehow a lot of people in England, in the US, but I do not think
 it is everywhere in the EU like that, somehow had the naive idea
 that these coups would take over everywhere, only good people,
 moral people would be involved, there would not be neo Nazis,
 there would not be horrid totalitarian people And unfortunately
 that has turned out ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/175332-mh17-plane-ukraine-demonizing-russia/

 people still on Maidan, according to Kiev s newly elected mayor,
 Vitaly Klitschko The prosecutor general said that law enforcement bodies should
 take measures to restore order in the capital s central districts
 as crime there was getting worse There are 19 buildings, including administrative offices and
 hotels, which remain under the protesters control According to
 Yarema s information, nearly 500 activists are living in the
 seized offices Instead of protecting the country, defending its
 independence in the East or working for the country s benefit,
 imposters are engaged in direct extortion and banditry, ùhe
 said On Wednesday, it was reported that over 60 pieces of art worth
 $185,000 had gone missing from the Ukrainian Museum of National
 History, which is in the Ukrainian house, international
 exhibition and convention center This building is currently in
 the control of the activists When asked about the possibility of using force while evicting
 the so called euromaidan encampment, Yarema replied: The
 option of force is possible If there is armed resistance, police
 officers have the right to use their weapons At the same time, he assured journalists that there will be
 no confrontation and people would only be detained if they
 offer resistance to police Responding to the prosecutor general s demands, Vitaly Klitschko
 said the use of force is an extreme ù measure, which he had never
 considered The forcible dispersal of Maidan, I am sure, can only be an
 extreme step I do not consider this and never have I am sure
 that we need to communicate so that people leave, he said Klitschko agreed that activists should leave so at least traffic
 could be restored along the city s main Khreschatyk Street He stressed that he has been receiving a large number ùcomplaints filed by Kiev residents because the blockade of
 the main artery of the center of Kiev, Khreschatyk, is paralyzing
 the work of the entire city ù Moreover, gunshots and explosions can be heard coming from the
 encampment from time to time Kiev s authorities have suggested that Maidan activists leave the
 city s main square and move to some location outside Kiev 
 However, this proposal was rejected Klitschko said that a joint decision on eviction of
 Maidan ùwill be taken in the coming weeks Elected Kiev s mayor back in May, Klitschko has so far failed to
 reach any agreement with activists occupying Maidan One of Klitschko first public statements after securing his post
 was a call for them to leave The key goal of the Maidan ousting the dictator has been
 reached, so the barricades should be dismantled, ùhe said
 back in May However, Klitschko s call provokedmass protestsas activists criticized Klitshchko for
 not taking into account their opinion on whether Maidan should be
 dismantled or not They threatened to start a third Maidan ù(following the
 2004 protest during the orangerevolution ù and the second one in
 November 2013 February 2014), unless the order to dismantle the
 barricades in the Ukrainian capital is rescinded That was when Vitaly Klitschko quickly changed his rhetoric,
 saying that Maidan should itself determine its future ",https://www.rt.com/news/171596-ukraine-maidan-dispersed-prosecutor/

 that civilians are not being targeted and the army is liberating
 the east of the country? Daniel McAdams:Well unless it is the most
 elaborate deception campaign in the history of propaganda,
 everything that I ve seen has shown that the jets and the
 military from Kiev are decimating villages And I think it should
 not be a surprise because the new president has already said, We
 will attack, and liberate our land, ù but the members of his
 administration have referred to the people in the east as
 sub humans, insects and other things So you first dehumanize the
 population and then you begin an ethnic campaign And I think
 that is what you are seeing in the east now is the beginning of
 an ethnic cleansing campaign We have already seen that
 100,000 plus have fled to Russia So this is the administration
 that has used deception and lies in the past and I think we re
 seeing it again RT:But if you say it s an ethnic cleansing
 campaign, then to what end? I mean, even though these people are
 living in the east of Ukraine and their tendencies and their
 sympathies may lie with Russia, they are still Ukrainian
 citizens DM:That is correct but they also are
 disconnected from Kiev It is very ironic, today in the US we re
 celebrating the 238th anniversary of our Independence Day where
 we broke away from an unelected tyrannical government far away 
 Yet, the same US government is now doing its very best to
 suppress the people in east Ukraine who want the very same thing
 just the ability to secede from a government that they feel is
 oppressive and does not represent their views So it is actually
 a sad irony sitting here in the US celebrating Independence Day RT:President Poroshenko is proposing a new
 time and place for the negotiations with these republics How
 committed do you think he is to those talks? DM:Well, he is committed but his position has
 already been clear: you have to surrender or be killed So, I
 think the talks, unless I m mistaken and it is very possible, I
 hope I am mistaken, but the talks will nearly be about the
 conditions of their surrender So those are not really talks in
 the true sense of the word So it is hard to be optimistic about
 it RT:So what kind of result do you think will
 come from them? DM:I do not think much will come from them,
 again unless I m terribly mistaken If you look at this post coup
 government in Kiev, this really is an orangerevolution 2 0 Look
 down at the persons, to the people who have been appointed they
 are all Yushchenko s retreads, they are all cronies of
 Poroshenko, billionaire oligarchs So this is nothing new If
 this was a revolution to get rid of corruption and to start
 afresh, it is a remarkable way of doing it So I think I do not
 expect anything different at all, except that this is way more

"28 Apr, 2014",‚ÄòRussia not obliged to finance Ukraine-EU integration‚Äô,"Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it
 badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage
 because of the political contradictions and ambitions over
 Ukrainian crisis RT:Has the gas supply to Europe ever been
 as threatened as it is now? Anna Van Densky:It has always been a problem
 like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was
 very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms
 that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an
 independent state They have to pay for gas as for any other
 commodity Now of course it s not the first so called gas war
 because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as
 an instrument of political pressure That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also
 threatened, that s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to
 stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation
 with crisis in 2006, 2009 It s a system that should be really
 reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that s why it s ideal
 for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the
 energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy,
 for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc So this
 dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the
 Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were
 many parasites around this easy money RT:Is South Stream pipeline really
 necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long
 term deal with Ukraine? What do you think? AD:There are a lot of details that are very
 ambivalent First of all, in any supplies it s much better to
 have multiple ways than one way, so it s not only for political
 reasons There can be other reasons like a catastrophe The
 problem of supply isn t dependent on Ukrainians as such [The]
 more routes, [the] more secure it is That s why you talk all the
 time about diversifying the ways of gas South Stream is an ideal
 way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to
 Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU So it s one of the ways,
 it s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through
 Ukraine, it s just diminishing this route and giving other
 alternative routes and opportunity It s also very fashionable
 because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative
 to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example RT:Ukraine still wants heavily discounted
 gas prices Is that a fair request? AD:It s not a fair request, no It comes from
 the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was
 basically one state Asking for this price is absolutely
 ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and
 buying a commodity It s a confusion and this confusion caused a
 lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment
 Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state,
 they had to accept that they can t develop their country on cost
 of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other
 countries That s the way it goes So it s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if
 Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together
 with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to
 help them to pay their bills, because it would be very na√Øve to
 expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian
 integration into the EU So it s not the way the things work Unfortunately, all the
 revolutions are very anti democratic because now the decisions
 are in the hands of a very small group of people, they were not
 elected democratically I personally hope that after the real
 democratic elections there will be new leaders who will accept a
 fair and modern style relationship with Russia RT:Isn t Russia s reputation as a reliable
 energy supplier is now a hostage to Kiev s political whims? Is
 there any solution? AD:The South Stream is an ideal solution
 basically because it goes from Russia through the Black Sea and
 to Europe It will help Europe because European needs gas badly,
 for example, Italy wants to develop southern Italy, and it would
 be a great opportunity for the economies of the south to get
 Russian gas Let s not forget that gas remains the most
 ecological among all types of energy So it s good for Europe,
 it s good for [the] economy and it s very sad that such a
 commodity is taken hostage because of these political
 contradictions and ambitions It s especially important to have South Stream corridor as a
 solution to diversify the ways of gas to Europe The latest
 Ukrainian Maidan revolution is not the first one, there was also
 the orangerevolution and the hope was flying high, but it didn t
 deliver it and it ended in a second revolution, Maidan When the
 situation will be stabilizing in Ukraine nobody really knows We
 hope it will be stabilized soon Anyway, I think that European
 and Russians, the taxpayers from both sides can t be taken
 hostage of this political instability in Ukraine, so the South
 Stream and Nord Stream, maybe other pipeline like Yamal, will
 help to create real strategic partnership and well being of the

 by relevant structures and who received special training 
 Enlisting can be hidden in quite innocent contexts We are seeing the departure of CIS citizens from home
 countries or Europe, where they reside as refugees, or their
 parents were refugees in the 1990s, to study in different
 educational centers mostly under the declared purpose of
 religious education, ùNovikov said Recently the committee has been marking an increase in mercenary
 terrorism, ù when international terrorist organizations eye
 changing management models in whole regions, defragmentation of
 states, and creation of new orders In this regard, the threat to the constitutional order in
 several regions significantly increases; the order may be
 destabilized when domestic problems are solved through military
 means, ùNovikov said The CIS is also concerned about militants who received hotspot
 training and now have returned home, but still continue subversive activities, ùhe said Such international militant bases, which also recruit and train
 mercenaries, are operating in Syria, Libya, Egypt, and across
 Pakistan and Afghanistan The CIS s concern has been also shared by some European states

KS:Yes, indeed This is a common sense and we are looking at it Because President Putin, when he first began in 2002 [sic] his stewardship of Russia, he was very pro European He wanted Russia to become a European power, to be accepted as a European power, to participate in equal measure with the West in dealing with European security He had broad ideas about Western security going from Canada right to the Urals And culturally, of course, Russia has always been a European part But his view of how to construct European security was not accepted by the West fully And then they did what we all know, progressively extending the borders of the EU and NATO, not only next to the former Soviet borders, but also trying to penetrate the former territories of the Soviet Union, the heartland of the former Soviet Union if you like They tried orangerevolution in Ukraine, you have the situation in Georgia, then they had this Velvet Revolution and all that in Central Asia So I think when President Putin spoke recently after the annexation of Crimea, listing up his grievances with the West, I think they were well founded And he has been experiencing that over the last 15 years he has been in power SS:You wrote about Western media bias against Russia What are your thoughts? Is the media just saying what the viewers want to hear or is it shaping the viewer s prospective? KS:It s both I ve been speaking a lot to some European leaders And some sensible ones actually feel that media at times is a step ahead whereas they in political part and understanding the responsibility of power want to be more moderate towards Russia, but at the media level the tirades against Russia, and propaganda against Russia is very strong A lot if it is led by NGOs and human rights organizations, and people like that, who have their own agenda Behind them there are, of course, agencies and institutions of the West, so I would say that are not only the governments that are making policy against Russia I mean, the Western governments But there are whole other elements in the equation including the media And the media gives a forum to some diehard anti Russian elements in the West And then they come out with that articles repeatedly listing out what they think are shortfalls in the Russia s performance, that Russia has not lived up to Western expectations in terms of democracy and the market economy And then they vilify President Putin personally and demonize him, and constantly bring up his past, KGB background, etc , to fuel the antipathy towards him and create an anti Russian bias in the public mind SS:You also said that West threats China as less menacing than Russia despite its rising power Why is that? Is that because the West economy is so intertwined with China s? KS:I have been saying for some years, not recently, that by weakening Russia, what is really happening is that a power vacuum that is being created is being filled by China And in fact, in the longer term, China has a population of 3 billion people Its economy is already the second largest in the world And the fact that they are now spending double digits on their defense, and they are the largest exporter in the world, the others are really the competitors and the potential adversaries of the West and the United States of America Russia is not In fact there is a huge shortsightedness in Western geopolitical attitude towards Russia Because Russia could actually be a vital balancing factor in international relations And that is why we in India, and I personally, feel that Russia is critical to an international balance between the big powers, in terms of economic and financial fusion between the United States and China I think that is where the problem is Because the total trade relationship between Russia and the United States is very little comparable to what it is with China It is maybe five to six times less And the US corporations are in China, looking at China in very large scales The bilateral trade is enormous, which then, of course, puts a lot of constrains on the US attitude and policies towards China, because at the end of it, the US corporations have a great deal of influence on the American foreign policy SS:The West is trying to impose all these sanctions on Russia even if it could actually hurt their own economy But do you think these sanctions can actually only reinforce the tighter cooperation between Moscow and the East? KS:Well, up to a point, yes But remember this is a delicate subject that although Russia and China are working closely together in the UN Security Council and share many points in common in terms of how to conduct international relations and counter some of the very negative US and Western policies towards the rest of the world, but at the end of it whatever Russia is losing, China is gaining China is emerging as the Number 2 power in the world, a position that the Soviet Union held And Russia is demographically in a huge disadvantage comparing to China: 145 million versus 1 3 billion, the kind of economic activity that China is generating So unless Russia is willing to accept being second fiddle to China in the years ahead, that s a different matter But if Russia also wants to be accepted fully, as it should be, it has to play its cards in such a way to be not too weakened by the West in a way that its dependence on China becomes more than it should be So there is a limit to the degree to which Russia can allow its relations with Europe and the West to deteriorate, notwithstanding all the provocations SS:So Russia has been expelled from the G8 global gathering Realistically speaking, how big of a blow is that? And also isn t the membership in G20 where economies on the rise have a say, more important? KS:Actually expelling or suspending Russia from G8 to my mind does not make any sense After all, if there are differences between the West and Russia what is required is dialogue and negotiation And to some degree this negotiation is continuing, as [Russian] Foreign Minister Lavrov is meeting [US] Secretary [of State John] Kerry, President Putin has spoken to President Obama, and then the Western countries are themselves pointing out, the US is pointing out, that there are so many areas in which they expect cooperation with Russia to continue So therefore suspending Russia from the G8 to my mind is pandering to domestic lobbies and to extremist opinion within the US and others It is, to my mind, not serious diplomacy You cannot afford not to talk to a country like Russia Therefore, frankly I think they are admitting that is a failure of diplomacy on their part SS:Russia is saying the G20 may eclipse the G8 as a leading international forum Do you feel the same? Could that happen? KS:Yes In fact that was the intention, that after 2008 global crisis, which was caused by the banks of the United States of America, and the very weak regulatory mechanisms, and the liberty given to hedge funds to engage in all sorts of financial speculation which caused such havoc in global economic markets, and the realization that the Western countries, US and Europe, were heading for low growth, economic stagnation, recession, that the G8 itself could no longer deal with the global economy and that, what was needed then was international cooperation, much more deep international cooperation in terms of meeting the challenges and hence the idea of the G20 So the G8 to that extent receded into the background And the primary discussions and decisions with the regard to jobs, global growth, combating the financial crisis, devolved onto G20 And in the G20, the emerging markets and others, and would be emerging markets, would be members So yes, to my mind the G20 was intended to supersede the G8 SS:You have said that the United States conduct is reinforcing the need to rebalance the international system which at the moment is tipped towards the West What are the main mistakes US is making? KS:I think, in their obsession with human rights, minority rights and democracy and the crusades that they have launched to impose these ideas globally, they are causing a great deal of instability all over the world If you look at all the hotspots of the recent years, whether it was Iraq or Libya or Syria, or the break up of Yugoslavia, etc , etc , or for that matter, the rise of terrorism, which is a country that is responsible for the rise of terrorism by actually involving extremists and fundamentalists, Islamic elements into the fight against the former union in the first place So if you look at the whole package of problems that we are facing today Who is behind this, whatever the intentions, leave aside Even for a moment, if you accept that this was done with good intentions, who is behind it? It is the United States of America and the West, Russia is not involved So the cause of instability is the tendency to interfere in the internal relations of others, to question the sovereignty of countries, to develop new norms, which then are used as instruments to change regimes and impose democracy and push forth market economy in the countries so that US and other corporations get access to these markets These are the factors if instability SS:You also believe that the term Äúinternational community Äù has essentially been hijacked by the West and its allies Are the opinions of such populous countries as India and China marginalized, you think? KS:I don t think so This is a rearguard battle that the United States and the West are fighting to preserve their domination of international affairs If you really look at the economic changes that are occurring and the shifts in the balance of power, that have taken place in the last couple of decades, it is quite clear that the West cannot afford to maintain the same degree of domination of the world affairs as before But of course great powers will not yield political, economic security ground so easily and they will fight back to the extent that they can I don t mean they will militarily fight back, I mean fighting back with the instruments of power at their command, which they are currently using against Russia: sanctions and things like that But this is a losing battle, we have to move forward to a situation where the international institutions have to be reformed, developing countries, the emerging economies have to be given greater share in decision making and norms have to be developed by consensus, not on the basis of advancing the agenda of the Western powers I think the historic movement is in favor of rebalancing power within the international system and emerging economies and BRICS countries will play a role in that SS:Like you have said the BRICS countries represent a fifth of global gross domestic product and have high geopolitical importance in their separate regions Yet the West is dismissing it and calls it artificial grouping Is it a self defense mechanism? KS:If you notice that if Western countries are left out of any international organizations or the multilateral organizations they feel threatened, because they want there in every multilateral organization that is formed so that they control it from within And they have the enormous resources, clout and influence to be able to do that Now BRICS therefore causes concern to the Western countries at least it has caused a great concern when it was first set up because we thought this was a good platform for promoting multipolarity and that each of the countries was going to become a fulcrum of influence within the regions in which they are Those who started attacking it, saying we are not democracies, that our geopolitical systems are very disparate and their interests collide with each other I think BRICS has shown the capacity to move forward Of course, we should not minimize the hurdles that lie ahead But BRICS is becoming more and more a reality SS:You ve also written that the BRICS nations are against regime change, interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, politicizing human rights and humanitarian intervention So is BRICS club essentially anti West? KS:No, I don t think so Look we have to be very realistic, because whatever the degree of commonality in our thinking and views on many issues which are confronting the international community there is also the fact that individually most of these countries, almost all of these countries have extremely strong relations with the West China, for example, is the strongest, the biggest economic partner of the United States of America After that is Japan Russia s biggest economic partner is Europe India s biggest economic partner is the United States of America So it is not as if it is a Äòneither/nor situation I don t think that BRICS are anti West Nobody needs to be anti West What they are against are the excesses of the West and the tendency of the West to dominate and, as I said, to create the kind of norms which give them the moral platform, they believe, to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and go in for regime changes and this and that And that has caused immense misery to the populations of the countries in which they intervene So BRICS, I think, can act as a corrective But certainly I don t think that BRICS intends to confront the West in any way I think the BRICS countries want a cooperative system in which their role and their views count SS:Among all BRICS members, India and China are the ones who have sharp differences What effect could that have on the BRICS partnership? KS:I think that is where the weakness of BRICS lies Because although at one level India and China have now become the largest partners in terms of trading goods, not in the whole economic relationship, yet there are serious differences between China and India relating to the border In fact, China has territorial claims on India And China s conduct in the South China Sea and the East China Sea And this very self assertive position on territorial issues is a matter of concern, because these attitudes that are being exhibited by the Chinese government have to be studied by us very carefully as they have implications for our own territorial differences with China And China is now very conscious of its great power status and has begun speaking the language of the great part it wants at G2 with the United States All these things we want to look at, but at the same time we are cooperating with China internationally on climate change issues, on the WTO issues We have both to oppose to regime change, this responsibility to protect and not showing respect for the sovereignty of other countries So therefore we have different levels at which we are working with China: cooperative at some levels, competitive at others But yes, for BRICS to become then to a very cohesive, strong force which would begin to count more than it does at present, there has to be a resolution to India China differences SS:But all five BRICS states have internal of challenges to overcome They need to focus on lack of social progress for example in Brazil, there is corruption in China, India, Russia, inequality, racial tension in South Africa Would those domestic problems impede the bloc from solidifying? KS:I don t think that the internal problems are standing in the way of these countries coming together as a force on the international platform, because these internal problems are there even in the Western countries in different degrees You know, for example Europe is going through a huge problem internally The eurozone is in trouble Germany is dominating Europe; Spain and Italy are in a mess Greece was in bigger a mess United Kingdom wants to walk out the European Union United States has been exhausted with all these military adventures in various parts of the world It still has a problem on the economic side domestically jobs are a huge issue The Western democracies have become dysfunctional The separation on parts which, on paper, looks very good makes in fact functioning of the United States as an entity more and more difficult also in terms of relations with the outside world So all countries have their own internal problems So if the West can continue to exert its force internationally despite all the problems they are facing internally, so can the BRICS countries to continue to exert their influence progressively more and more on international affairs, even as they tackle their domestic problems I don t see it as a Äòneither/nor situation SS:The BRICS are also about to launch a separate financial powerhouse: the BRICS Development Bank Can it ever dream of countering the IMF, the World bank or the World Trade Organization? KS:No, I don t think so I don t think so Not in the foreseeable future in any case And in any case, for the time being we are only discussing the $50 billion capital for the BRICS Development Bank which is nothing compared to not only the IMF and the ADB and others, but in terms of global needs It is a very small step But, yes, it can be built up But then, down the road, I think there will be some concerns at who would potentially dominate this bank given the China s $3 3 trillion foreign exchange reserves and huge amounts of capital at its disposal To have a system where there is some degree of equality in the management of a new financial institution will be a lot of work to be done ahead So it is not going to happen tomorrow or day after But yes, it is a good step RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/brics-russia-world-system-824/
"10 Apr, 2014","Internet giants to government: We can spy on customers‚Äô data, you shouldn‚Äôt","Silicon Valley has been largely speaking out as of late against the United States government s controversial surveillance programs, but some say the nation s top cyber firms are scared that their own abilities to collect info could soon be eroded Months into the ongoing and always heated debate about the US
 National Security Agency s spy operations, President Barack Obama
 said last December that he had appointed a small panel of experts
 to assess the NSA programs in question that had been exposed
 after former contractor Edward Snowden started to disclose
 classified documents earlier that year That review group has
 since presented a few dozen recommendations to the White House,
 andlast monthPres Obama asked Congress to
 codify into law changes concerning the way that the US government
 gets access to certain sensitive records î namely the telephony
 metadata created by telecommunication companies and currently
 gathered in bulk by the NSA, as exposed by Mr Snowden In January, however, the president also said a separate group
 would reach out to privacy experts, technologists and business
 leaders to inspect the way that big data ù is created, collected
 and used by both the public and private sector, and whether
 we can forge international norms on how to manage this data and
 how we can continue to promote the free flow of information in
 ways that are consistent with both privacy and security ù Ultimately, Obama said at the time, [W]hat s at stake in
 this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines or passing
 tensions in our foreign policy ù Now this week in the National Journal, reporter Brendan Sassowritesthat Google is getting
 nervous ùover what the president had to say On the one hand, the Internet behemoth wants the public to
 know it s outraged by US surveillance programs and is
 aggressively lobbying for new rules to keep its customers data
 safe from the government s prying eyes, ù Sasso wrote But as public attention turns to data privacy, Google,
 Facebook, Yahoo and other tech giants want to be sure that their
 own data gathering practices don t get lumped in with the federal
 spying programs that are the target of popular ire ù Indeed, the giants of Silicon Valley î even some of the ones
 implicated in certain NSA spy programs, according to Snowden s
 leaks î have spoken up about alleged counterterrorism
 intelligence gathering practices perpetrated by the NSA that
 routinely sacrifice the privacy of the world s wired population
 in exchange for supposed national security for some At the same
 time, however, some î including Google î have earned reputations
 for not exactly valuing customer data as being something sacred
 or sensitive Incourt documentsfiled by the search engine giant
 last year surrounding a class action lawsuit concerning the
 company s automated scanning of messages sent through its Gmail
 service, Google said Indeed, a person has no legitimate
 expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over
 to third parties And while the CEO of Facebook may have
 recently lashed out publically at Pres Obama over the NSA s
 activities, the social networking site has been scrutinized
 heavily over their own issues regarding privacy in the past, and
 just this year weresuedfor allegedly monitoring its user s private
 messages When leaked NSA documents suggested last year that the US had
 beentapping into informationsent between Google s
 datacenters in an unencrypted state, however, the search
 company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, said it was
 outrageous ù Then when disclosure made last month
 accused the NSA of masquerading as Facebook in order to trick
 targets and take over their computers, CEO Mark Zuckerbergsaidhe was confused and frustrated by 
 the behavior of the US government ù Another remark made
 by the social networking star in a statement published last month
 î that The US government should be the champion for the
 internet, not a threat ù îwas all but echoed by other leading
 websites and tech experts who blamed the country s behavior for
 undermining the very infrastructure of the net But with big data ù being brought into the Obama administration s
 crosshairs too now, Sasso says those same companies are saying
 Leave us out of your spying fight ù And some, he added
 for an article published by the Journal on Tuesday this week, say
 there is widespread frustration with the White House ù
 because of both big data and the NSA s operations being examined
 at once Companies have very specific relationships with their users,
 and they tell them what they re doing with their data, ùone
 unnamed technology industry lobbyist said to Sasso On his part, Sasso succinctly summarized the difference between
 the public and private sector s information gathering in just two
 sentences: Tech companies are lobbying against NSA spying because they
 worry it could undermine trust in their services, ùhe said 
 But they depend on the ability to harvest data about users
 to target advertising and to provide other services, ù John Podesta î the Obama administration counselor tasked by the
 president in January to review big data technologies î said
 during an address at University of California Berkley this month
 that Big Data requires us to ask ourselves, how do we
 embrace new technologies and the progress they bring to our
 society, while at the same time protecting our fundamental
 freedoms and values, like privacy, fairness and
 self determination? ù [T]he legal and policy questions that these technologies
 raise are quite old, ùBerkley s newspaperquotedPodesta as saying In the midst of what some are calling a Big Data
 revolution, ùhe said, we re taking this opportunity to
 consider the landscape, and to really interrogate whether our
 existing policies are prepared for what s on the horizon
 technologically ù Now according to Sasso, Silicon Valley is shaking because î
 despite being assured by his anonymous tech source that comparing
 the NSA with big data is on par with assessing apples and
 oranges ù î the cyber companies that collect personal
 information for reasons other than alleged national security
 could soon lose their ability to harvest data as well ",https://www.rt.com/usa/big-data-nsa-obama-664/
"30 Mar, 2014",From Chocolate King to Darth Vader: Ukrainian presidential hopefuls submit bids,"Sunday, March 30 was the last chance for candidates to get their names on the list of presidential hopefuls Twenty four candidates expressed their will to join the election race, 7 of whom have already been registered by the Central Election Committee To be registered all nominees had to submit their applications to
 Ukraine s CEC, including a monetary deposit of 2 5 million hryvna
 ($236,000) On April 5, the CEC will finish considering the
 applications and registering candidates, and the election
 campaigns will go into full swing They will have 50 days to
 persuade Ukrainians to vote for them on May 25 The main candidates have been known since Saturday, when the main
 political parties nominated their choices Ukrainian businessman and pro European MP Pyotr Poroshenko enjoys
 the highest rating among potential presidential candidates A
 mid March opinion poll showed he would score 36 2 percent of the
 votes After UDAR s leader boxer turned politician Vitaly
 Kiltschko withdrew his own candidacy, Poroshenko was nominated as
 candidate to represent the party in the presidential election Often cited as one of the most influential people in Ukrainian
 politics, Poroshenko served as Foreign Minister under President
 Viktor Yushchenko in 2009, and Economic Development and Trade
 Minister under President Viktor Yanukovich in 2012 From 2007 to
 2012, he served as chairman of Ukraine s National Bank Poroshenko is also a confectionery magnate, who has been dubbed
 the Chocolate King ùAnnouncing his candidacy, Poroshenko said he would focus on
 building new, effective, modern armed forces ù to
 protect the country s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and
 vowed to create more jobs Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine s former prime minister, has submitted
 her application to the CEC after being nominated as candidate by
 a unanimous vote at a Batkivshchina (Fatherland) Party
 conference Tymoshenko outlined her election program as a campaign of direct
 action ù There will be no promises, she vowed Tymoshenko was a major figure in the so called orangerevolution 
 in 2004, when supporters of pro western Viktor Yushchenko
 challenged the victory of pro Russian Viktor Yanukovich in the
 presidential election After two rounds of the election disputed
 by the opposition and mass protests, Yushchenko eventually won a
 third round Tymoshenko was Ukrainian prime minister from 2007 to 2010 She
 ran for president in 2010, only to be narrowly beaten in a
 run off vote by Yanukovich Her second term as a PM was cut short as in 2011 she was
 sentenced to seven years in prison for abuse of power for her
 role in the January 2009 gas contracts with Russia Tymoshenko
 supporters, who had been saying that the case was politically
 motivated, warmly welcomed her at Maidan Square in February 2014,
 as she was released amid a raging political crisis Tymoshenko s
 early release came after the Parliament amended the law to free
 her It was also the day when she first voiced her intention to
 run for the presidency on May 25 Speaking after her party s nomination on March 30, Tymoshenko
 declared the unity of the people of Ukraine ù the main
 goal, stressing necessity of returning Crimea She vowed a
 personal fight against oligarchs ù and expressed her
 confidence that Ukraine should join the EU in the shortest
 possible time ùAccording to a recent poll by Ukrainian research group SOCIS,
 11 6 percent of respondents said they would support Tymoshenko
 should she take part in the second round of elections Initially a self nominee, Mikhail Dobkin, who is currently under
 house arrest, facing separatism charges, was among the first
 people to submit his candidacy At the Saturday s Congress, the
 Party of Regions named him as its candidate with 315 party
 delegates supporting his nomination Dobkin said he was going to appeal for his house arrest to be
 revoked to let him have a full fledged presidential campaign Businessman turned politician and the former governor of the
 eastern Kharkov region, he vowed to focus on reviving diplomatic
 relations with Russia, if elected president The most
 difficult issues can be solved with diplomacy, ù he told his
 fellow party members after the nomination Touching upon Crimean
 Peninsula, Dobkin said it is necessary ù to return the
 territory With President Yanukovich having asked to exclude him as leader
 of the Party and chairman Nikolay Azarov having fled the country,
 the Party of Regions had to elect a new leadership before
 nominating candidates Aside from Dobkin, other three party members submitted their
 candidacies as self nominees Sergey Tigipko (country s former
 vice PM in 2010 2012), Yury Boiko (vice PM in 2012 2014) and Oleg
 Tsarev A survey conducted in mid March by the SOCIS polling organization
 estimated that Mikhail Dobkin could secure 5 3 percent of votes Unlike other parties, the ultranationalist Svoboda party had no
 intrigues or disputes and, as it was anticipated from the very
 beginning, nominated its long time leader Oleg Tyagnibok His
 candidacy was supported by all 568 delegates to a Svoboda party
 conference Devoted to the ideas of nationalism, Tyagnibok has been a member
 of the Social National Party since 1991 and then became its
 leader in February 2004, the year when the party received its
 current name In 2004 he was kicked out of Parliament over a fiery speech that
 was slammed for anti Semitic rhetoric He was back in Parliament
 eight years later with his right wing Svoboda party securing 38
 out of 450 seats Svoboda is a far right party that emphasizes national sovereignty
 and sees neighboring Russia as the biggest threat Speaking to fellow party members, Tyagnibok said he would stick
 to The Program for the Protection of Ukrainians accepted by Svoboda In the political part of its program, the Svoboda Party demands
 Ukraine s suspension from the CIS, the Common Economic Space and
 EurAsEC, in which Russia is also a member state It wants close
 political and economic cooperation with natural allies (Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and
 Bulgaria) as well as with the US and the UK Tyahnybok was a candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2010,
 but then he received only 1 43 percent of the total vote He is
 wanted in Russia for organizing a stable armed group
 (gang) ùand fighting alongside militants during the Chechen
 war in 1994 95 The Right Sector group s leader Dmitry Yarosh is a self nominated
 candidate for the post of Ukrainian President The
 ultra nationalist movement announced on March 24 that it wants to
 become a political party The Right Sector political party also
 includes the Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) branches the
 Ukrainian People s Self Defense (UNSO), a paramilitary force, and
 Trizub (the ultra right Stepan Bandera All Ukrainian
 Organization) The Right Sector is highly critical of the coup appointed
 authorities in Kiev It accuses the acting president, Aleksandr
 Turchinov, of playing undercover games ù Russia charged Yarosh with inciting terrorism after he urged
 Chechen terrorist leader Doku Umarov to launch attacks on Russia
 over the Ukrainian conflict Moscow put him on an international wanted list for participation
 in hostilities against Russian soldiers in Chechnya in 1994 95 A recent poll conducted by Ukrainian research group SOCIS about
 presidential election preferences showed that only 1 6 percent of
 people were ready to vote for Yarosh Meanwhile, the majority of those who submitted documents to the
 CEC and $236,000 deposit are self nominated candidates Self nominated Olga Bogomolets managed to submit her candidacy at
 the second attempt The first time she did not have enough money
 for the deposit She shared pictures of her registering at the
 CEC on her Facebookpage Bogomolets was the main doctor for the Maidan mobile clinic when
 protests turned violent in Kiev in February She treated the
 gravely injured and helped organize their transportation to
 neighboring countries, who provided assistance in treating those
 with severe wounds Bogomolets turned down the position of Deputy
 Prime Minister of Ukraine for Humanitarian Affairs offered by the
 coup appointed regime Bogomolets appeared to be unwillingly involved in the scandal
 over a leaked phone conversation between the EU foreign affairs
 chief Catherine Ashton and Estonia s foreign affairs minister 
 The latter referred to this same Olga [Bogomolets] ùwho
 he claimed had told him that all the evidence shows ùthat the same snipers ù killed policemen and protesters Also on the list of the presidential hopefuls are a number of
 party leaders: First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party s
 Central Committee, Pyotr Simonenko, the chairman of the
 nationalist Ukrainian People s Party, Aleksandr Klimenko, leader

"28 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãIntellectuals standing ground on Ukrainian issue,"As my plane left Dubai for Kiev, I began browsing through an endless pile of newspapers and magazines: from the New York Times to the Economist, from the Times to several Gulf based and Turkish periodicals, as well as Spanish and German ones Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist He can be reached through hiswebsiteand hisTwitter The consensus on Putin being a villain was absolute There were
 no dissident voices, but also, not surprisingly, no Russian
 intellectual voices There were absolutely no editorials written
 by Russians attacking the Western destabilization of Ukraine and
 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel

"21 Mar, 2014",‚ÄòNew Ukrainian govt undemocratic in the extreme to push for early EU association agreement‚Äô,"It seems undemocratic in the extreme of the new Ukrainian government to be forging ahead with signing the association agreement with the EU ahead of elections, security analyst Charles Shoebridge told RT The Yatsenuk government should have waited for two months, to get
 the formal democratic mandate to do that, Shoebridge
 believes On Friday, Ukraine and the EU signed anassociation agreement, signaling closer relations On February 19, the Ukraine s National Security and Defense
 Council ordered the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to introduce visa
 requirements for Russian citizens However, several hours later
 the Ukraine s Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenuk said that government
 wouldn t rush to introduce visas with Russia, given close
 socio economic and family links between the two nations Such a
 controversy in official statements on the same issue makes you
 think that there is no consensus among the new authorities,
 Shoebridge believes RT:What are actually the real intentions of
 the new government in Kiev? And will the new leaders in Kiev be
 able to overcome their divisions by the time of the elections in
 May? Charles Shoebridge:Yes, thisvisasituation is one of the latest of a number of
 occasions where there seems to be [a number of] conflicting mixed
 messages coming from within the Ukraine government Of course,
 one could say Well, there is some confusion within the
 government, it s a new government after all; it needs some time
 to settle in and get its policies sorted out and speaking in one
 voice ù But there could be another reason for this, which is that there
 are struggles for power, if you like, within the Ukrainian
 government itself After all the Ukrainian government is
 currently dominated by two political parties Within these
 parties different individuals have different views and different
 agendas as well, so it may well be that the lack of communication
 between different aspects or different parts of the Ukraine
 government with some more willing to assert their desires and
 their agenda than others And certainly there seems to be lack of
 consultation within the government, and this power struggle for
 authority and positions within that government structure may well
 accelerate What we are seeing is not these mixed messages becoming less over
 time; they actually continue to happen suggesting that the
 direction of the Ukrainian government is not towards settling
 down and speaking with one unified voice And we also need to
 consider it in the context of the upcoming elections suggested to
 be two months away, and they will be jostling for power and
 influence And the elections, even if they do go ahead smoothly,
 may not return people to the same ratio of power that s currently
 within the Ukraine government, which of course is far from being
 an inclusive government RT:Ukraine s interim prime minister has
 also postponed the signing of the economic part of the
 association agreement with the EU But wasn t the EU deal the
 main goal of the protests which led to the upheaval? How will
 Maidan react to this further delay? CS:Initially, the Maidan protests were sparked
 by the decision not to sign the EU association agreement, but I
 think they quickly moved into something much more important; they
 turned to a desire to have less corruption and indeed one could
 even say that the reaction against the political establishment
 was reflected when Timoshenko came and spoke to Maidan, and there
 was some disaffection in the crowd that the old guard were coming
 back to dominate what some would see as their revolution But the numbers on the Maidan were very small; this was not the
 orangerevolution of hundreds of thousands of people We were
 talking about 20 30 thousand people even at the maximum times and
 this is the opposition s own figures And of course many of those
 have now gone home because they see that toppling the old
 government that was their aim has been achieved One needs to look at where the power actually lies, and it seems
 to be that in many cases the police and the established
 functioning organs of states are actually not functioning, and
 the power of the street still seems to be largely in the hands of
 certain activists more on the far right, those who have been more
 organized on military lines Svoboda is powerful within the
 government in terms of the number of positions it holds 
 Consequently, the demonstrators on the street are perhaps not as
 important as they once were It s also certainly the case that if
 the election is due to be held in two months and the old
 government was toppled supposedly on the trigger of the EU
 association agreement, then it would be seen by many, I think
 quite rightly, to be undemocratic in the extreme to be forging
 ahead with such a controversial measure without any formal
 democratic mandate Just by delaying by two months the signing of
 this agreement, it could potentially be done for the people of
 Ukraine to speak in a fair and free election with a democratic
 mandate RT:Arseny Yatsenuk is now condemning the
 referendum in Crimea However, back in 2007, as Ukraine s foreign
 minister at the time, he was supporting Kosovo s independence 
 Why is that? CS:I think it s well established that
 politicians generally, of course there are exceptions, use
 principles on a piecemeal basis We ve heard many Western
 politicians condemning the taking over or the referendum itself
 in Crimea The referendum has really just proved what people knew
 would happen anyway I think even in the West there was an
 acceptance among political leaders that even if the election had
 been completely free and fair, the vast majority of people [in
 Crimea] would have voted to go back to Russia And yet that has been condemned in the West because it puts the
 Western leaders in a difficult situation where they are actually
 condemning the principle of self determination The thing that
 according to Western arguments makes this referendum illegal is
 that the Ukrainian government won t allow it to happen But even
 if secession or independence wasn t legal because it wasn t
 approved by the Ukrainian government, this doesn t mean you can t
 hold a referendum Of course, it s enacting on a referendum that
 may well be illegal In Kosovo, of course, the Western leaders would say it was a
 different situation because there was a humanitarian
 intervention, and then the referendum took place But the
 independence took place some years later, so there was no
 overriding humanitarian reason at that time So you will get the
 situation that even can apply in a broader sense to situations
 such as Iraq and even perhaps Afghanistan to some degree But the
 West sees fit to intervene in the independence of other nations
 to violate sovereignty, and indeed in this case of Kosovo to
 create a new state without the consent of the parent state But
 they will try to find differences in this case Notwithstanding all of that, I think there is an acceptance among
 the West s leaders that Crimea is a special case, that they will
 make much noise right now about the situation, but they
 understand without any shadow of a doubt that this is a fait
 accompli and that Crimea is now a part of the Russian Federation The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-association-agreement-with-eu-341/
"20 Mar, 2014","‚ÄòCrimea is now part of Russia, the West has to come to terms with that‚Äô","Claiming that Crimea is part of Ukraine is the same as Serbia arguing that Kosovo is not really separated from it, Gregory Copley, editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs, told RT Crimea is now part of Russia, the West will come to terms
 with that, the question is how much longer they ll perpetuate the
 crisis in the rest of Ukraine and whether they will escalate the
 problem, which I think will be unwise for the US and Western
 European interests, ùCopley said Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell s Chief of Staff, goes further,
 saying that as long as Crimea belongs to Russia, Ukraine should
 be made a buffer zone between the West and Russia This is a serious situation that will be alleviated with
 recognition that Russia and Crimea are going to be together, a
 recognition that the Ukraine should be a buffer state between let
 it say NATO, the West, and Russia, and a recognition on the
 Russian side that that s the case and Ukraine is left alone, and
 the same thing on the Western side, ùWilkerson argued He blames the US for the creation of the artificial crisis, which
 resulted in downgrading relations between great world powers
 whereas their cooperation in other spheres is so needed Obviously it s not working the way we were trying to make it
 work, which is largely the US s fault that they try to extend
 NATO well beyond NATO s proprietary distance, and its ability to
 handle an alliance that was spread all the way to Kiev, to
 Tbilisi This is absurd We started this mess, we knew (we should
 have known if we had a brain) that Russia would react to it, now
 Russia has reacted, let s come down, let s handle it like the
 great powers we re supposed to be, ùLawrence Wilkerson told
 RT Gregory Copley also highlights another aspect of this issue,
 namely US financial programs aimed at boosting colorrevolution s 
 He claims that the 2004 orangerevolution was one of the examples
 of these programs What the US and the EU have done over the past decade or
 more has been to fund the colorrevolution in Ukraine in 2004,
 etc , and the subsequent outbreaks recently, which have led to
 this present situation And if they had the ability to act more
 overtly, they would have done so They ve instead chosen to act
 through street protests and indirect sociological warfare to
 mobilize the Western Ukrainians to seize power when they were not
 able to do so electorally, ùhe said Copley also added that there is an indication that the US
 and the EU have had no way to go and they say they don t wish to
 engage Russia militarily ù It s not to say that they could prevail ultimately in a
 military confrontation with Russia, that s not the point The
 point is why do you want to do it over a prize which is perhaps
 not worth having if you are NATO or the EU or the US? ùhe

"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ] The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia This has been the colorrevolution s that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments It s not something that comes as a surprise to me SS:You ve mentioned Georgia and orangerevolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s SS:You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another prot√©g√© of that whole Shachtmanite issues You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations SS:But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years SS:The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the orangerevolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent ù SR:I absolutely agree The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned ù or gotten out of control ù it s a fine line There are individuals who are very well trained These NGOs operate on every level They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier because the patrols are less likely it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia Herzegovina is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the European Union has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time SS:With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? ù What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing SS:If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp of ¶ and there s a lot of money that comes with that There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders it comes with the good price tag SS:So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your money ¶NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative SS:If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either Let s say that NATO does want to come in they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies ¶because NATO won t come in as a state, run only ¶you know, European Union will have to come alongside it So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it I think the Western economy is poison SS:You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that ¶ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic That s the problem that I have with this You talk about hegemony the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance SS:What about these sanctions that the U S and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success They would slow down the amount of success that they are having The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the European Union, and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia ¶you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time SS:But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany ¶ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise SS: ¶It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, ù how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the European Union I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine SS:If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"12 Mar, 2014",Russia ‚Äòvery restrained‚Äô considering Washington‚Äôs plot for Ukraine,"Russian reaction to the Ukraine crisis so far has been very restrained considering the level of ideologically driven strategic threat the US has brought to Russia s borders, former member of the Reagan administration, Paul Craig Roberts, told RT RT:Ukraine s deposed leader is claiming
 that Washington is breaking its own laws when offering money to
 the current authorities in Kiev Does he have grounds for such
 claims? Paul Craig Roberts:Of course, he is correct 
 The US has been lawless now for about four presidential terms We
 don t obey our laws, we don t obey international laws, we torture
 people The US is lawless It does whatever it wants to do I
 mean the government is lawless, Washington, the executive branch RT:Well if it has no credibility from your
 point of view, what do you make of the fact that US is supporting
 what Yanukovich said is a totally illegitimate government in
 Kiev? PCR:They wanted to capture Ukraine for a long
 time They tried in 2004 with the orangerevolution and now they
 think they have it They mainly wanted Ukraine in order to put
 missile bases all over Russia s borders And that is the main
 purpose RT:So Putin s response has come as no
 surprise to you? PCR:I think the Russian response has been very
 restrained considering the level of strategic threat that
 Washington has brought to Russia RT:And talking about the strategic threat,
 what do you make of NATO sending forces to Ukrainian borders? Is
 it helpful in this tense time? PCR:The Americans are reckless How many
 countries have they invaded? How many places are they carrying
 out violence as we speak? They want world hegemony There re
 three countries in the way Russia, China and Iran And so they are going to do whatever they can to weaken those
 countries so they cannot stand up to Washington s hegemony And Ukraine, that is what Ukraine is all about, everyone knows
 it s a coup plot by the Americans I mean by Washington, I don t
 think the American people have a clue And Washington s money is
 behind the coup and that Washington is not paying attention to
 some of the unsavory elements that are participating in this new
 government, because all Washington wants are military bases in
 Ukraine in order to intimidate Russia and to degrade Russia s
 military capabilities And that is what the whole thing is about So it is dangerous
 because Washington is intent on exercising its hegemony over the
 world and so that is what you are faced with This is a direct,
 ideologically driven, strategic threat to the sovereignty of
 Russia ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-hegemony-ukraine-role-238/
"12 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãPeople expressing their opinion horrify Ukraine‚Äôs coup-installed govt ‚Äì Russia‚Äôs Upper House chair,"The West is advancing its plans and geopolitical interests by playing the Ukraine card to the detriment of Russia s interests, but these bad actors disregarded quite a few factors, the chair of the Russian Upper House Valentina Matvienko told RT RT:Ms Matvienko, you spent your younger
 years in Ukraine, and your surname also seems to have a Ukrainian
 origin You know the region very well, too, so I would really
 love to hear your opinion on the recent events in Kiev Were they
 caused by internal or external reasons? VM:I m Russian Matvienko is my husband s
 family name But it doesn t matter I do love Ukraine a lot RT:You lived there? VM:I lived there as a child And I think every
 Russian now feels very deeply about what s happening now If we
 look at how many relatives and friends Russians have in Ukraine
 and Ukrainians have in Russia, it becomes crystal clear that we
 are genetically interconnected We are one nation; we share one
 Orthodox Christian faith and a long common history We come from
 the same cradle Why civilians started a peaceful protest is easy to understand 
 The people were angered by the low living standards and high
 unemployment, including youth unemployment Over 3 million
 Ukrainians are known to be working in Russia, and still more have
 jobs in other countries Their discontent was understandable But
 that discontent was manipulated by armed nationalists to take the
 power into their own hands These are the internal reasons As to
 the external reasons, the US is now clearly trying to achieve its
 geopolitical goals by playing the Ukraine card We know of the
 first attempt it took during the orangerevolution , when in
 violation of international law, the third round of the elections
 was announced to get into power the president they supported 
 This put Ukraine under Yushchenko ten years behind in terms of
 economy That made the people so angry that, at the next
 election, Yushchenko made it to barely 10% of the votes That s
 how Ukrainians made it clear what they thought of such a policy In 2008, the US said it was ready for Ukraine s accession to
 NATO This was in line with attempts to draw Ukraine into the EU
 and NATO as soon as possible, imposing a certain path on Ukraine
 while disregarding Ukrainians own opinion No one asked the
 people But the people felt very differently about it! That s why
 Victoria Nuland said they had spent 5 billion dollars to promote
 democracy in Ukraine RT:Just how acceptable is it to spend such
 enormous funds on democracy in a foreign country and to speak
 publicly about it? VM:This is called meddling in another country s
 domestic affairs, which runs counter to international law And we
 can see what this democracy ended up in, with radical
 nationalists setting the tune in Ukraine and preaching a Nazi
 ideology under slogans like Ukraine for Ukrainians only They
 don t even realize what a potentially explosive situation they ve
 been creating There are millions of Russians and other
 ethnicities there Ukraine is a multiethnic state So repealing
 the law on language caused a lot of outrage in the
 Russian speaking regions in the east of the country and that
 doesn t boil down to Russian speakers only Annulling the law
 against Nazi propaganda was just as bad, even unthinkable In
 fact, Yanukovych did hand in his power, like the opposition asked
 him to RT:You mean the 21st February
 agreement? VM:Before that, he annulled the laws that did
 not sit well with the opposition, dismissed the Prime Minister
 and offered that post to Yatsenyuk, signed the agreement of
 February 21 and pulled the police out of Kiev He never gave any
 orders to use force We could see that clearly Unfortunately
 neither the Western nor the Ukrainian media have shown any of
 this to their audiences, breaking the people s right to free
 information They never showed the Berkut units who stood up for
 the constitutional order of the country without using any
 weapons, bravely resisting the gunfire, the Molotov cocktails,
 the stones hurled at them Yanukovych fulfilled all the
 obligations That s why it s fair, like President Putin said, to
 ask: Why stage an anti constitutional coup? Why take power by
 force? Why didn t they choose the path of peace and democracy?
 What happened was a breach of every democratic rule there is 
 Disbanding the constitutional court and bringing criminal charges
 against its judges is totally unprecedented in world history 
 not to mention the violent seizure of public buildings and
 deposing a legitimate government, as well as the vehement
 Russophobic propaganda targeting Russia, their own neighbor RT:I can t help agreeing with you here:
 we ve seen a lot of bad press from Ukraine, so to say VM:It should be objective, rather than good or
 bad RT:But unfortunately it s bad press VM:There is no unbiased coverage whatsoever!
 Instead, we can hear hysterical claims that Russia has allegedly
 declared a war on Ukraine! But that s not true RT:This takes us to my next question 
 Propaganda is one thing, but high level contacts are another Why
 does the West blame Russia for dividing Ukraine? What is their
 reasoning? Anything apart from servicemen in civvies in Crimean
 streets? VM:Those who orchestrated the coup in Ukraine
 are bad conductors They disregarded quite a few factors First,
 Ukraine is no third class country It is a large European country
 of 45 million people Ukraine s eastern, central, southern
 regions view the situation differently from its western part The
 intimidation and terror in Ukraine, the media hype and the ban to
 speak Russian brought the population of Eastern Ukraine to the
 streets They said they won t recognize the government, which is
 illegitimate, and they disagree with where it is taking the
 country But their voices remained unheard This was followed by
 groundless claims that Russia is allegedly stoking the situation 
 That s not true! It s enough to attend one of the peaceful
 protests in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russians were so
 scared the gunmen and militants might interfere with their
 peaceful life, that they asked Russia to protect them We re so
 tired of all the revolutions, chaos and anarchy, that s what
 they said as they addressed Russia We tried to stand by for
 quite some time So no one can accuse us of meddling into
 Ukraine s domestic affairs RT:Do you think that we stood by for too
 long? VM:I guess we should have spoken up earlier 
 But we did our diplomatic best in line with international law as
 a civilized nation But now Russia cannot tell millions of
 Russians in Ukraine that it doesn t care or won t offer any
 protection The time has come The Russian President, for his
 part, can see hundreds of thousands rallying across Russia and
 saying, We must protect the Russians, and we cannot leave them
 to their own devices! We felt that genocide was looming and the
 ban on the Russian language would be soon followed by the slogan
 Ukraine for Ukrainians brought to life That would mean lots of
 refugees coming to Russia We don t want this to happen! We would
 like all ethnicities, including Russians, to co exist peacefully
 in Ukraine So when Crimeans learnt that the militants were about to come to
 Crimea and start another Maidan like massacre right next to the
 Russian Black Sea Fleet, which has been based there for 220 years
 under an international agreement do you think we should have
 waited for the first drop of blood to fall? That s why the President asked us for help The developments were
 so rapid and unpredictable that we decided to give him the right
 to send troops as the last resort in an emergency RT:When the MPs authorized Putin to use
 military force, it had a bombshell effect VM:Our consent RT:Ms Matvienko, while it s clear that war
 won t be starting any time soon, what do you think should happen
 to spur Russian troops to cross the border into Ukraine? VM:Our consent to deploy troops if needed sent
 a clear message to all the hotheads in Ukraine to stop in their
 tracks and sober down, to consider the opinion of the eastern
 regions and remember Ukraine is a multiethnic country, to embark
 on a constitutional path and abide by the February 21 agreement,
 which suggested a step by step action plan and a snap
 presidential election Why didn t they do it? Why didn t they set
 themselves apart from the radicals, disarm the militants and show
 to Ukraine that the current government IS taking action? They
 should have included representatives of the southern and eastern
 regions into the cabinet as well, to make their voices heard But
 they didn t do any of that! Instead, they chose to take the path
 of threats and violence I am entirely convinced, however, that no troops will be sent I
 hope that there are many more sensible people than radicals in
 Ukraine Everyone understands the possible consequences A war
 between Ukrainians and Russians is plain unimaginable ‚Äì we are
 two brotherly nations RT:So that declaration was merely a
 political move? VM:It was a warning that Russia won t leave
 millions of Russians alone in trouble in case of genocide RT:Speaking of the future, how do you think
 the Crimeans will vote at their referendum: in favor of the
 Constitution that gives them broader autonomy or in favor of
 joining Russia? VM:I ve already told you why the Crimeans were
 so frightened by the ongoing crisis and why they pushed the
 legitimate Crimean government into asking President Putin for
 help and protection It was the Crimeans who scheduled the
 referendum for March 16, not the Russians There are no Russian
 troops in Crimea We ve got our Black Sea Fleet under enhanced
 guard just in case there is a conflict which I hope will never
 happen Crimeans have a right to self determination Even in the Soviet
 era, Crimea had a broad autonomy The 1992 Constitution gave
 Crimea lots of powers However, over time they shrank to zero and
 Crimea was stripped of all the autonomous rights Now Crimeans
 are told how many Russian schools they should have and there is a
 ban on using the Russian language! That s what made them go for
 one of the two options: either to go back to the 1992
 Constitution with a broader autonomy, or to join Russia That is
 an absolutely legal action in line with international practice 
 just like the Scottish independence referendum, just like it was
 in Kosovo and so on Only the Crimeans have the right to decide 
 So let us not speculate I ve got my own thoughts on this, but
 I d like to stay away from predictions And may their idea of
 their own future come true The present Ukrainian government has already spoken of its
 intention to enter the EU and NATO, but they should have asked
 their own people first! They should hold a referendum and ask the
 people that question, so that they could express their own
 opinion But the authorities won t do it because they re afraid
 most people will not support this abrupt swing to the West, as it
 will be no good for the Ukrainian people Those who stirred the
 chaos in Ukraine understand that Ukrainians are not to be cut off
 from Russia They made up the Ukrainians mind without even
 asking them So let s wait for the Crimeans decision Then we ll
 be able to build our own policy RT:If the Crimeans vote to join Russia at
 the referendum on Sunday, it will usher in a new Cold War,
 according to influential political analyst Dmitry Trenin I
 disagree I think the Cold War never ended How would you comment
 on this? VM:Political analysts can say what they please 
 The Cold War, which lasted for forty years, saw the conflict of
 two political, social and military systems Fortunately, that
 Cold War is over But judging by the Western press, many
 politicians in the West have kept the Cold War mentality Russia
 is accused of every imaginable sin There is absolutely no
 objective information to be heard The country has changed; it
 has a completely different political form of governance But they
 choose to ignore this I am strongly opposed to any wars,
 including cold wars Russia will do its best to avert such a
 scenario And I hope that the US and Europe understand what
 consequences there may be, should anyone attempt to start a new
 Cold War We all must put every effort into avoiding it RT:You mean that the Cold War will be over
 once its last soldier is dead? One of them is Zbigniew
 Brzezinski, by the way VM:He must be very happy now to see his scripts
 being staged! RT:Certainly So according to the so called
 Brzezinski plan, the fire that started in Kiev will soon reach
 Russia Would you agree that the events in Kiev are a testing
 ground for what is to happen in Russia? VM:One thing is clear: the West is advancing
 its own plans and geopolitical interests by playing the Ukraine
 card to the detriment of Russia s interests Imagine having NATO
 troops in Ukraine at our border running over 2,000 km! This is
 unacceptable Besides, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
 collapse of the USSR we got all the guarantees that NATO would
 never move any closer to Russia s borders RT:And what has happened ever since? VM:And now these guarantees have proved to be
 worthless Look, a whole of three European governments promised
 security to Yanukovych and the implementation of these
 agreements RT:And what has happened to him? VM:Look what has happened to him and to those
 guarantees! There is only so much hypocrisy you can have, sorry 
 There are legal and political solutions to these problems And we
 have been looking for a political solution to the Ukrainian
 crisis from the very beginning RT:Ms Matvienko, sadly, we re running out
 of time Thank you very much for this interview I wish you all
 the best VM:My pleasure RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005‚Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/geopolitical-interests-ukraine-game-230/
"9 Mar, 2014",‚ÄòWest backed Ukrainian extremists to get rid of Yanukovich‚Äô,"When the West realized they could not get rid of President Viktor Yanukovich through peaceful demonstrations, they brought in the mob, journalist and writer Christine Stone has told RT Leaders of far right groups like Dmitry Yarosh in the Ukraine are
 useful to the West because their existence allows them to back
 more moderate political figures and save face, Christine Stone,
 who acted as an observer at Ukraine s presidential election
 during the orangerevolution a decade ago, told RT RT:What do you make of the decision by the
 leader of the Ukrainian far right group, Dmitry Yarosh, to run
 for President do you think he stands a chance? CS:No, I don t think he stands a chance But he
 serves a very useful purpose for the West in that when he is
 soundly beaten by moderates ù like Yulia Timoshenko or Vitaly
 Klitchko they will be able to appoint who the sensible and
 moderate Ukrainian voter wants ù So I think he serves a purpose
 in this forthcoming election, assuming it takes place as
 predicted RT:Russia s Foreign Minister said the West
 was aware of the influence radical groups have on the interim
 Ukrainian government, yet prefers to stay silent on that issue 
 Do you believe that s the case and if so, why? CS:I think the West has used extremists in
 various wars and upsets that have been caused in the last 20
 years or so Originally in Georgia in 1991, the mafia helped
 chase Zviad Gamsakhurdia away from power Similarly in Syria and
 Libya extremists were used in Syria s case unsuccessfully, at
 least so far to break the Assad government, and to get rid of
 Colonel Muammar Gaddafi So, I think what happened in Ukraine was when they realized they
 weren t able to shift Yanukovich and his government through
 peaceful demonstration, they had to call upon the mob, the mafia,
 to bring this about in this case of course the far right So I
 think they are aware of what s gone on and I m afraid they have
 been fully involved RT:The West seems to be rushing to assure
 Ukraine it will be welcome in the EU and NATO What s in it for
 Europe and the US? CS:Obviously in terms of NATO it means the West
 and its forces will be one step nearer the Russian border So
 there is a lot to gain there As far as the EU is concerned, it s
 a slightly more nuanced state of affairs I think it s very unlikely with things as they stand that Ukraine
 will become a member of the EU But, it is not impossible if the
 West in any way felt they were backed against a wall they could
 hurry them in, or at least hurry a western Ukraine in That would
 cause enormous problems, particularly for member states like
 Britain, which have taken in thousands of people from Eastern
 Europe and the former Soviet Union over the past ten years I think the prospect on the ground for Ukraine entering the EU
 for many member states would be fairly dramatic and unwelcome ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-west-mafia-yanukovich-722/
"3 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãRule by oligarchs: Kiev appoints billionaires to govern east,"The self proclaimed government in Kiev has appointed two of Ukraine s richest men to govern large industrial regions in the defiant east One of the reasons for the Maidan protest was the influence the rich have on politics in the country The appointments of new governors of Donetsk and Dnepropetrovsk
 Regions are among 18 made on Sunday by Kiev, which is struggling
 to consolidate power after the coup which ousted President
 Yanukovich last month The newly appointed Dnepropetrovsk governor is Igor Kolomoysky,
 Ukraine s third wealthiest man, with an estimated fortune of $2 4
 billion He co owns the informal commercial group Privat, which
 includes Ukraine s largest bank Privatbank, which Kolomoysky
 heads, as well as assets in the oil, ferroalloys and food
 industries, agriculture and transport A former ally of Yulia Tymoshenko, Kolomoysky reportedly had a
 falling out with her and refused to finance her election campaign
 in 2010, which the ex prime minister subsequently lost to
 Yanukovich Kolomoysky was reported to be a principal sponsor of
 the UDAR party, which is one of the three fueling the street
 campaign to oust Yanukovich Kolomoysky has a dual
 Ukrainian Israeli citizenship and controls his business empire
 from Switzerland The new governor of Donetsk Region is Sergey Taruta, who is
 estimated to worth around $2 billion, putting him among the
 top 10 wealthiest people in Ukraine He heads ISD, one of the
 biggest mining and smelting companies in the world, and also own
 Donetsk based Metallurg Football Club Not a stranger to politics, he used to sponsor Viktor Yushchenko,
 who came to power in Ukraine after the orangerevolution of 2004 
 Among his personal habits is a reputed love for luxurious jewelry
 and ostentatious gold statues, reports RT s Peter Oliver The appointments will have a positive effect on the regional
 aspect, ùbelieves Vladimir Groisman, who was appointed
 vice president for regional development in the self installed
 government They are well known and wealthy people They had a choice 
 they could by a plane ticket or fly their own plane and go to
 another country and wait for the developments there Or they
 could take responsibility I respect their choice, ùhe said Among the accusations mounted on Yanukovich by protesting crowds
 in Kiev was the charge that he used his presidential power to
 take over assets of Ukrainian businessmen and make an illegal
 fortune for himself and his allies Some Ukraine observers
 suggested that the oligarchs, threatened by presidential greed,
 financed the Maidan protests, seeing them as leverage on the
 government After his ouster, photos from Yanukovich s opulent residence of
 gilded furniture and a private zoo in suburban Kiev made
 headlines worldwide There is little doubt that many of those who
 sought to topple him for being corruptly enriched would eye the
 appointment of affluent businessmen to offices of power with a
 deal of suspicion The feeling is palpable in many comments in Ukrainian media That s good news I m tired of those businessmen in
 power, ùsaid one sarcastic commenter at the site of the
 Ukrainskaya Pravda a leading online news service It s OK The oligarchs have been controlling the regions
 anyway I think they will provide order, because only they have
 the authority, unlike some middle rank appointees, ùsoothes
 another one Are they handing out fiefs? I m sick of it Is that what the
 people died for at the Maidan? ùanother commenter says There is also the regional aspect, which Groisman mentioned The
 better developed industrial east of Ukraine depends on business
 ties with Russia and would be hurt badly by the EU association
 agreement, which the new government wants to sign as soon as
 possible Mistrust towards Kiev is growing in the east, with
 several regions already declaring they would not be taking orders
 from the capital The defiant regions seek greater autonomy from the central
 authorities Having the right to elect their own governors as
 opposed to have them appointed in Kiev, is one of the demands

"24 Feb, 2014",Ron Paul: Leave Ukraine alone!," Last week Ukraine saw its worst violence since the break up of the Soviet Union over 20 years ago Protesters occupying the main square in the capitol city, Kiev,
 clashed with police leaving many protesters and police dead and
 many more wounded It is an ongoing tragedy and it looks like
 there is no end in sight The current conflict stems from a divide between western Ukraine,
 which seeks a closer association with the European Union, and the
 eastern part of the country, which has closer historic ties to
 Russia The usual interventionists in the US have long meddled in the
 internal affairs of Ukraine In 2004 it was US government money
 that helped finance the orangerevolution , as US funded NGOs
 favoring one political group over the other were able to change
 the regime These same people have not given up on Ukraine They
 keep pushing their own agenda for Ukraine behind the scenes, even
 as they ridicule anyone who claims US involvement A recent leaked telephone conversation between two senior
 government officials made it clear that not only was the US
 involved in the Ukrainian unrest, the US was actually seeking to
 determine who should make up the next Ukrainian government! Senator John McCain, who has made several trips to Ukraine
 recently to meet with the opposition,wrotelast week that the US must stand up to
 support the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea Why are US government officials so eager to tell the Ukrainians
 what they should do? Has anyone bothered to ask the Ukrainians?
 What if might help alleviate the ongoing violence and bloodshed,
 if the Ukrainians decided to re make the country as a looser
 confederation of regions rather than one tightly controlled by a
 central government? Perhaps Ukraine engaged in peaceful trade
 with countries both to the west and east would benefit all sides 
 But outside powers seem to be fighting a proxy war, with Ukraine
 suffering the most because of it If you asked most Americans how they feel, my bet is that you
 would discover they are sick and tired of the US government
 getting involved in every crisis that arises Certainly the
 American people want none of of this intervention in Ukraine 
 They understand, as recent polls have shown, that our
 interventionist foreign policy is only creating more enemies
 overseas And they also understand that we are out of money We
 could not afford to be the policemen of world even if we wanted
 to be And I bet if we asked the Ukrainians, a vast majority of them
 would prefer that the US î and Russia and the European Union î
 stay out their affairs and respect their sovereignty Is it so
 difficult to understand why people resent being lectured and
 bribed by foreign governments? All we need to do is put ourselves
 in the place of the Ukrainians and ask ourselves how we would
 feel if we were in the middle of a tug of war between a very
 strong Canada on one side and a very strong Mexico on the other 
 We would resent it as well So let s keep our hands off of
 Ukraine and let them solve their own problems! Former Congressman Ron Paul s article first appeared atthe free foundation org, the temporary home

"24 Feb, 2014",‚ÄãWill NATO annex Ukraine?,"Anyone who believes Washington is deeply enamored of democracy in Ukraine must hit eBay, where Saddam Hussein s WMDs have been found, and are on sale to the highest bidder Or pay attention to the non denial denials of the Obama
 administration, which swears on a daily basis there s no proxy war or Cold War redux in Ukraine In a nutshell; Washington s bipartisan Ukraine policy has always
 been anti Moscow That implies regime change whenever necessary 
 As the European Union (EU), geopolitically, is nothing but an
 annex to NATO, what matters is NATO extending its borders to the
 Ukraine Or at least Western Ukraine which would be a valuable
 consolation prize This is a purely military centric game the logic of the whole
 mechanism ultimately decided in Washington, not in Brussels It s
 about NATO expansion, not democracy When neo con
 State Department functionary Victoria Nuland had her 15 seconds
 of fame recently, what she actually meant was We re NATO,
 F**k the EU ùNo wonder there will be an urgent NATO Defense
 Ministers meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, centered on Ukraine No one will ever read that in US corporate media or in academia
 for that matter Harvard Professor Francis Boyle talking to Voice
 of Russia, or Princeton s Stephen Cohen in a recent article for
 the Nation, are glaring exceptions Every informed analyst knows the mastermind of this policy , since the 1970s, is Zbigniew The Grand
 Chessboard Brzezinski Dr Zbig was US President Barack
 Obama s mentor at Columbia and is the Talleyrand of the Obama
 administration s foreign policy machine He may have softened up a notch recently, arguing that although
 the US must remain the supreme power across Eurasia, Russia and
 Turkey must be seduced by the West Yet his historic Russophobia
 was never diluted As we re now on the road (again) of regime change in Ukraine,
 that seems not such a lousy deal for only $5 billion the amount
 volunteered by neo con Nuland herself Compare it to other lavish
 Bush Obama continuum foreign adventures, from Afghanistan and
 Iraq to Syria Yet expect major bumps ahead Most arguably progressive, as well as some rabidly right wing,
 Google generation denizens in Western Ukraine and in Kiev seem to
 entertain the notion that the country, under regime change, will
 be accepted as an EU member, they will get an EU passport, and
 will find a good job in Europe, just as Polish plumbers and
 Romanian restaurant managers did Well, not really If only they could board an EasyJet and see
 with their own eyes what s going on, job market wise, in southern
 Europe or in London for that matter, now terrified of a horde of
 Eastern Europeans seizing English jobs As for the ultra nationalists and frankly neo fascists totally
 anti EU the only thing they care about is to get rid of the
 Russian Bear s embrace And then what? In the West s ardor for democracy it s so easy to
 forget that Western Ukrainian fascists were aligned with Hitler
 against the USSR It s their descendants that have been in the
 forefront of the hardcore violence last week And Right Sector
 still insists they will continue to protest In this
 sense they may not be Washington s preferred puppets; they are
 just momentarily useful patsies As for former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko now
 elevated in the West to the status of a blonde Mother Teresa 
 she has called the Maidan (Independence) Square protesters liberators ùThey may soon liberate themselves from her
 after highly corrupt Saint Yulia runs for president
 next May The Ukraine that works in the east and south is made up of
 historic Russian provinces, think Kharkov, the Black Sea, Crimea 
 The country s GDP is roughly $157 billion That s one fifth of
 Turkey (which may become the new Pakistan) As it is, Ukraine
 holds no economic value whatsoever to the West (even less if it
 becomes the new Syria) The only positive would be
 NATO s warped strategic advance Anyone who believes a mired in crisis EU will buy Ukraine out of
 is economic mess could once again bid for Saddam s WMDs on eBay 
 Or imagine the US Congress handing out $15 billion for Ukraine to
 smooth out its foreign debt, not to mention reducing the price of
 imported gas just like Moscow did last December The multi billion dollar question now is what Russian President
 Vladimir Putin will do One must feel tempted to detect roars of
 laughter in the Kremlin corridors For starters, Putin will decide whether or not Moscow will buy $2
 billion in Ukrainian eurobonds after there s a new government in
 Kiev, as Gazeta ru reported Kiev will get absolutely nothing
 from Moscow until it s clear the new regime will play ball, in
 the interests of holding the country together Saint Yulia, by the way, was originally thrown in jail
 because of a gas deal that was negotiated on Moscow s high price
 terms Back to hard facts: Ukraine cannot survive without Russian
 gas, and the Ukrainian industry cannot survive without the
 Russian market One can mix all shades of Orange, Tangerine,
 Campari or Tequila Sunrise revolution, and throw in the requisite
 IMF structural adjustment correction these facts are
 not going to change And forget about the EU buying
 Ukrainian The Western Orangeade gang from masters to servants may still
 bet on civil war, Syria style Anarchy looms provoked by the
 neo fascists It s up to Ukrainians to reject it A sound
 solution would a referendum Get the people to choose a
 confederation, a partition (there will be blood) or keeping the
 status quo Here s a very possible scenario Eastern and southern Ukraine
 become part of Russia again; Moscow would arguably accept it 
 Western Ukraine is plundered, disaster capitalism style, by the
 Western corporate financial mafia while nobody gets a single EU
 passport As for NATO, they get their bases, annexing Ukraine, but also get myriads of hyper accurate Russian Iskander
 missiles locked in their new abode So much for Washington s strategic advance The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/will-nato-annex-ukraine-414/
"23 Feb, 2014",Freed Ukraine ex-PM Tymoshenko tells Maidan to carry on the fight,"Newly freed Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko has called on protesters not to abandon Kiev s Independence Square, even though a deal with opposition leaders has already been signed You have no right to leave Maidan Don t stop yet, ùshe told rioters in an emotional speech Tymoshenko gave a trademark firebrand speech in front of a large crowd in central Kiev She called for those responsible for the scores of deaths that have taken place over the past three months to be prosecuted When snipers were shooting in hearts of our guys, those bullets will always hurt If we don t prosecute, we should be ashamed, ùsaid the former prime minister, who earlier in the day indicated that she may run for president in May Until you finish this job and until we travel all the way, nobody has the right to leave, she added Because nobody could do it not other countries, nobody could do what you have done We ve eliminated this cancer, this tumour Tymoshenko arrived in Kiev after being released in Kharkov on Saturday, traveling straight from the airport to Independence Square In 2011, the former Ukrainian PM was sentenced to seven years in prison for abuse of power while signing the January 2009 gas contracts with Russia A court in Kiev found Tymoshenko guilty under Part 3 of Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine Tymoshenko has already declared that she will run in Ukraine s upcoming presidential election, local media cited her as saying when she was released The Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) has scheduled the nationwide vote for May 25 On Saturday, the Ukrainian Rada ruled that Tymoshenko would be freed promptly, in accordance with international duties, ùITAR TASS quoted parliament as saying The vote was 233 in favor of the decision A day earlier, 310 MPs voted to decriminalize the count under which Tymoshenko was serving her term Back in 2011, the court ruled that Tymoshenko exceeded her authority as prime minister of Ukraine after talks on January 19, 2009 with then Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin It was during those talks that Tymoshenko agreed to a Ukrainian Russian gas supply and transit deal According to the court, the agreement caused Ukraine s national oil and gas company, Naftogaz, to lose around US$170 million The court s ruling added that Tymoshenko would not have the right to occupy certain positions in the state government for three years after the completion of her sentence She was also ordered to pay damages Right after the sentence was handed down to Tymoshenko, Putin expressed confusion, adding that it was dangerous to doubt the validity of the gas contracts Later, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he believed the criminal case against Tymoshenko was politically biased In May 2012, Tymoshenko began serving her sentence outside the confines of prison, at a hospital in Kharkov The former prime minister was one of the leaders of the pro European orangerevolution in 2004 Tymoshenko s reemergence in politics is not good news for other opposition leaders, lecturer Bruno Drweski from the University of Paris told RT I think there are too many leaders in the opposition, Tymoshenko will be one more I don t see how the opposition can be united when we observe strong differences between the Maidan people and the leaders of the opposition On that aspect, the fact Tymoshenko will be back is not good information for most opposition leaders, ùhe said Besides that, Tymoshenko s alleged connections with Moscow in the past and accusations of corruption may become an obstacle on her way to reestablishing her leadership In 2008, a top Ukrainian oligarch, Dmytro Firtash, spoke to the US ambassador to Ukraine describing her as an accomplished oligarch who had made deals with Moscow, ùaccording to a US diplomatic cable leaked by WikiLeaks Firtash referred to Tymoshenko s title of gas princess as a misnomer; he explained that Tymoshenko did make lots of money off of a corrupt, perpetual gas debt scheme during the 1990s, but she knew nothing about the gas business, ù the cable read Video by RT Spanish correspondent Bricio Segovia shows Yulia Tymoshenko as she arrived to Kiev s Independence Square: ",https://www.rt.com/news/freed-tymoshenko-ukraine-maidan-288/
"22 Feb, 2014",EU writes Ukraine's eulogy,"The EU s so called crisis plan for Ukraine is itself a recipe for catastrophe It is a brokered plan by the wrong people, under extreme (Western) outside pressure, and on behalf of a small group of backward looking and dangerous ideologues Peter Lavelle is the host of RT s showsCrossTalkandOn the Money, and was the anchor of the review programme In Context and the commentary series IMHO Peter Lavelle has extensive experience in academia and the world of business He did his doctoral studies at the University of California in Eastern European and Russian studies He has lived in Eastern Europe and Russia for a better part of the last 25 years During that time he was a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, a market researcher for Colgate Palmolive, an investment analyst for a number of respected brokerage firms, including Russia s Alfa Bank In the realm of media, Peter Lavelle is widely published He has written for Asia Times Online, Moscow Times, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, United Press International, In the National Interest, and Current History to mention only a few Peter Lavelle is the host of RT s showsCrossTalkandOn the Money, and was the anchor of the review programme In Context and the commentary series IMHO Peter Lavelle has extensive experience in academia and the world of business He did his doctoral studies at the University of California in Eastern European and Russian studies He has lived in Eastern Europe and Russia for a better part of the last 25 years During that time he was a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, a market researcher for Colgate Palmolive, an investment analyst for a number of respected brokerage firms, including Russia s Alfa Bank In the realm of media, Peter Lavelle is widely published He has written for Asia Times Online, Moscow Times, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, United Press International, In the National Interest, and Current History to mention only a few The plan essentially leaves Ukraine ungovernable and
 inadvertently promotes a secessionist agenda The idea to return to the constitutional order of 2004 is
 pointless and truly bizarre One of the key issues during the
 orangerevolution was which institution should predominate the
 presidency or parliament Well, the Ukrainians have now tried
 both with the same result failure Why a parliamentary centered
 system will work now is not explained What is worrisome is the
 fact that Viktor Yanukovich has agreed to give away to parliament
 control over the police and security forces Don t expect any
 investigation into extreme violence committed by the rioters But
 do expect a witch hunt against the police and security forces! The brokered deal calls for a national unity government within
 days Will this include the Right Sector? How about those who
 used violence against the legally established constitutional
 regime? If this is the case, then it is akin to allowing
 arsonists to become firefighters While Dmitro Yarosh s Right
 Sector controls the streets of Kiev, national unity is an
 illusion Another point is constitutional reform This is laughable on its
 face The opposition (and their riotous thug friends), as well as
 the EU, have trampled upon the constitution for months Ukraine
 has conducted two elections recently (presidential and
 parliamentary) and been given a clean bill of health from
 Brussels and Washington With such blatant abuse of the rule of
 law in Ukraine, it is hard to believe that ultranationalist
 bigoted rioters have any use for any constitution The deal also includes a presidential election no later than
 December 2014 (only a few months before the current president s
 term expires) However, there must be a new constitution in place
 before this happens Again, this does not pass the laugh test We
 should expect Ukraine s eastern and southern region to demand
 considerable autonomy from Kiev under a new constitution Western
 Ukraine will surely object to this Thus, don t expect a new
 constitution soon or a presidential election this year Then there is the issue of investigating recent acts of violence 
 This is to be conducted by authorities, the opposition, and the
 Council of Europe Who is the opposition in this case? Dmitro
 Yarosh s Right Sector? Are we to believe just because a racist
 thug will wear an expensive (EU paid for) suit, he will be
 respectable and legitimate? There is even more naivety: The authorities will not impose a
 state of emergency and both the authorities and the opposition
 will refrain from the use of violence This element of the deal
 is hardly worth commenting on The government should have
 declared a state of emergency weeks ago and cleared Maidan 
 Indeed, violence has been used on all sides However, when any
 so called political opposition resorts to arms, it is called
 insurrection (and is illegal and illegitimate) While the EU and the US (i e the leaked Victoria Nuland tape)
 have been shown to be relentlessly attempting to destabilize
 Ukraine, Yanukovich is no less to blame for Ukraine s dire state 
 He has been indecisive and irresponsible All of this could have
 been avoided had he been more presidential Instead, it appears
 he only was concerned with his re election ambitions Needless to
 say, today he is practically irrelevant This is quite
 extraordinary considering virtually all state institutions across
 the country remained loyal to Yanukovich during this artificially
 created crisis (coming from the West) Yanukovich betrayed them 
 And he betrayed Ukraine and its partners It is hard to think of a scenario in which Ukraine can remain the
 sovereign state it is today During the failed orangerevolution ,
 there was a united opposition Viktor Yushchenko was recognized
 and seen as a legitimate leader by a wide range of opposition
 groups Sadly for all Ukrainians, Yushchenko s time in office was
 an unbelievable failure Today the situation is acutely worse 
 Ukraine has a shockingly weak and indecisive president and
 oppositions that are hardly reading from the same page Who is
 running whom: Dmitro Yarosh or Vitaly Klitschko? Klitschko is
 certainly politics lite and happy to be run by the likes of
 Victoria Nuland, but Yarosh is a different and very extreme
 figure only a small minority in the country will ever follow
 him In a country like Ukraine, where the central leadership is weak
 and the opposition is also weak and fragmented, the logic of
 secession starts to enter the imagination Before the events of
 the orangerevolution , Ukraine was divided; the current crisis
 begins to force the question of why the status quo should be
 maintained There are ample reasons why Ukraine s east and south
 will now consider ending any meaningful relationship with those
 who now control Maidan and all of Kiev Beyond what was called the civilizational choice is who
 actually contributes to the country s budget The east and the
 south pay Ukraine s bills today Is the EU interested in adopting
 a poor and backward western Ukraine? If so, where will the money
 come from? Will western Ukrainians be allowed to freely work
 within the EU? Many other questions come to mind While the EU and the US State Department have been ceaselessly
 recruiting proxies on the ground and media spinning Ukraine, this
 former Soviet republic faces economic collapse and financial
 default The economic situation in Ukraine is grave Russia has
 decided to step away from its gesture of economic aid in the
 amount of $15 billion When it was promised, there was a
 legitimately elected government in Kiev Now the EU plan up ends
 the political playing field Will Victoria Nuland and Brussels
 bail out the rioters on the streets of Kiev? The good folks of
 eastern and southern Ukraine would like to know Washington and Brussels have long wanted and planned regime
 change in Ukraine This just might happen But both should be
 wary of wishes coming true The end result may be a failed
 western Ukraine state on its border populated with people with
 less than euro values to say the least Then there is Russia
 and its interests Western mainstream media again are at their
 best when it comes to mediocre, lazy, and biased reporting The
 fact is, Russia doesn t trust the political class in Ukraine 
 irrespective of its political tastes and preference Whether it
 is Viktor Yanukovich, Viktor Yushchenko, or Yulia Tymoshenko,
 from the Kremlin s perspective they are all political losers and
 unreliable partners Ukraine is being torn apart It is my guess that Washington and
 the EU will get the least desirable piece of the action Regime
 change is a bad habit that historically leads to even worse
 outcomes Sadly for Ukrainians, Western bad habits do nothing to
 make their lives better Peter Lavelle is host of RT s political debate program

 was looking for the same people on Euromaidan, hoping to meet the
 same attitude, the same warmth But for some reason, it turned
 out that people are getting ready to fight ù Dmitry struggles to understand if what s happening in Ukraine is a black or a white page in history ùAt the protesters 
 camp he is confronted by the masked rally participants, who have
 no such doubts There can t be any dialogue between the present government
 and the opposition They ve crossed the line No talks! They must
 resign We won t be satisfied by anything less, ùone of them
 says But mostly Kiev seems to be a place of ceaseless controversy,

 know, who s sponsoring the protesters A woman replies that

 kinds of protest equipment I come to Maidan every day, ùshe says I leave my
 child with my husband and come here ù The young man s unconvinced People who haven t been to work for three months buy petrol
 for Molotov cocktails with their own money? God, how much have
 they saved up? ù Maidan is very heterogeneous, and its face is constantly
 changing, says Vasily Stoyakin, a Kiev based political analyst On weekends, there are plenty of city dwellers, and then
 Maidan looks more crowded, more sensible, and friendlier, ùhe tells RT But on weekdays, there are Maidan protesters
 for hire from Galichina and even straight up homeless
 tramps ù Protesters can t forgive the so called Berkut special police
 forces for the violent crackdown on a rally in November The
 Berkut people complain of provocations from far right
 demonstrators On the houses where the members of the special forces live,

 for peace They have a sick need for war, ùhe says But that s maybe true of only the frontline crowd Vox populi,
 which Dmitry records, by interrogating numerous taxi drivers on
 his way through Kiev, shows a great variety of views from
 supporting to cursing protesters, and occasionally complete
 indifference to what s going on While some Kievans bring food and warm clothes to protesters,
 others do the same for the Berkut Despite the unit having been
 demonized by many, following the November violent dispersal of
 protesters, some of the city residents see it as the only force
 they can rely on for maintaining security Kiev might be torn between masked groups of people, defending
 conflicting points of view, but some of the unmasked Maidan
 inhabitants are clearly out there not for war, but for peace 
 That s certainly true of a woman doctor, who keeps vigil in the
 protesters camp while believing there are instances, when the
 division into us and them ceases to be relevant I ll tell you something If burning gas hits a Berkut

was on the rise, and that peaceful protests would easily force Yanukovich s government to fulfill the demands of the opposition led crowd Protesters held hands, forming human chains They sang, danced, and waved anti government and pro EU placards amid an almost festive atmosphere National flags dominated the demonstrations Few paid attention to the scuffles that occasionally broke out between aggressive masked youngsters and police in Kiev Attempts to storm government buildings were thwarted by law enforcement officers The opposition fueled the crowd s energy with promises that they would not leave central Kiev until the government was reshuffled and the EU deal was signed However, the protests did not come anywhere close to the scale of the 2004 rallies, and the stage rhetoric did not work The demonstrators began to grow tired of fruitless protests Meanwhile, pro government rallies took place in Kiev and several other regions of the country, showing that not all Ukrainians were pleased with the terms of the EU deal that threatened to undermine the country s economic ties with Russia The protests in Kiev suddenly received a second wind after the harsh dispersal of a rally on Independence Square (Maidan) on November 30, for which the city s police chief was sacked The Maidan demonstrators shifted their energy from the EU deal towards clear demands to topple the government, despite Western media still calling them pro EU integration protesters Nationalist red and black Bandera flags ù dotted the rallies in Kiev and in Western Ukrainian cities In Kiev, violent rioters armed with makeshift weapons, flares, and even a tractor managed to hijack the mainstream media s attention as they pounced on police cordons, despite some protesters attempts to prevent the clashes At first, the rioters were blasted as government provocateurs ùby the opposition Just a few weeks later, the same masked people would be hailed as heroes of the revolution ùand the opposition would demand that they not be called provocateurs As barricades were erected and administrative buildings were seized in central Kiev, well organized and well equipped members of radical groups formed part of Maidan s self defense ù against police The Right Sector movement, uniting several nationalist groups, took part in the action For some time, peaceful protesters coming to Maidan attempted to dissociate themselves from violent riots Masked and armed people co existed on the square with those sharing food and tea and tirelessly piling up meters high barricades on Kiev s central streets However, there became a silent acceptance of Maidan s battlefront after Kiev officials passed new public order laws and central streets of the city exploded with flames As rioters hurled Molotov cocktails at police cordons and vehicles, some people on the square supplied them with hastily made petrol bombs Opposition leaders fruitlessly trying to calm the rioters down were booed at and sent away As clashes escalated and the first deaths at the barricades were reported during police retaliation, the rioters began to get serious about arming themselves While some laughed at a catapult constructed to hurl rocks and firecrackers at police, rioters were alreadyarmingthemselves with light firearms and wearing gas masks and body armor The situation took an even more grim turn when a group of radicals that were taking part in a peaceful march ù of the opposition attempted to storm Ukrainian parliament The violence spread, despite previous arrangements of a ceasefire between the opposition and the government But it seemed that talks were not enough, as rioters rejected proposed agreements and turned peaceful protests into violent attacks Violence has escalated to unprecedented levels Many protesters and police officers were killed or injured after sustaining gunshot wounds Thursday s clashes grew more violent by the minute, with more masked rioters firing rifles and pistols at police in central Kiev The rioters stormed and looted the nearby unprotected office of the ruling Party of Regions, setting it on fire Another group of armed rioters seized a hotel, firing at police through its windows Radicals went on a rampage, seizing police stations in the Ukrainian capital and capturing an army unit Rioters constructed barricades around the newly seized buildings The words and guidance of opposition leaders were ignored as the death toll reached 77 people on February 20 Both security forces and rioters were reported stalking the streets with rifles Even now, after an agreement was signed between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and opposition leaders, thousands of rioters are still protesting in central Kiev Rioters are now in full

 Yanukovich government in Kiev and lock Ukraine into the EU and,
 ultimately, NATO Washington s agenda has little to do with democracy and freedom , and a lot to do with
 destabilizing Putin s Russia On Sunday, January 19, the eight week long series of protests and
 demonstrations against the government of President Viktor
 Yanukovich in Kiev escalated to a new level of violence Bands of
 right wing militants called Pravy Sektor (Right Sector), attacked
 Ukrainian police guarding government buildings and attempting to
 contain the protesters Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at riot police from the top
 of the Dynamo Kiev football stadium in central Kiev beginning
 January 19 Police responded by using stun grenades and tear gas
 against the mobs Vehicles were torched by the hooligans from the
 neo Nazi Pravy Sektor More than 60 police were hospitalized from
 barrages of rocks, stones and Molotov cocktails The core of Pravy sektor is made of the activists of radical
 groups, including Trizub , Patriot of Ukraine ,as
 well as UNA UNSO and the Svoboda (Freedom) ultra right
 party, which won nearly 10 percent of votes at the last
 parliamentary election in Ukraine They are pro EU The far right violent radicals told Radio Free Europe, a US
 Government media agency tied to the CIA and State Department,
 that they were preparing full bloody guerrilla war against the
 government Andrey Tarasenko, Pravy Sektor s coordinator warned, If they attack and try to carry out a bloody crackdown, I
 think there will be a massacre Guerrilla warfare will begin in
 Ukraine Tarasenko stated that their demands ùare to oust the
 current government and build a nation state in
 Ukraine What kind of nation state we must imagine They also
 demand that Yanukovich step down, but, generously enough, add
 that they would give him and his family 24 hours to leave
 the country safely ù On their VKontakte (In Contact) social network website, the
 organization calls for donations of items such as slingshots,
 steel balls, gasoline, laser pointers, glass bottles, chains, and
 pyrotechnics Their published manifesto is nothing short of bizarre: All
 those who at this point would try to tame the revolutionary
 energy of the masses should be proclaimed traitors and punished
 in the most severe way The time of peaceful singing and dancing
 at Maidan [Independence Square] is over This is a waste of time 
 There can be no negotiations, no compromise with the ruling gang 
 We will carry high the fire of national revolution ù Curious is the fact that in the beginning of the protests, Pravy
 Sektor members were calling themselves the Maidan
 self defense force They had been designated by the main
 opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk and Oleg
 Tyagnibok to provide security for peaceful protesters Now they
 clearly have split from the peaceful protests Even more bizarre is the fact that in recent days ambassadors of
 several EU member states, as well as the US and Canada have gone
 to Maidan to meet Pravy Sektor activists and learn how the
 headquarters of national resistance operates Instead of unequivocally condemning the rise of violent Ukrainian
 nationalism, which could turn Ukraine into another Yugoslavia or
 Libya, the West is only threatening President Yanukovich with
 sanctions, while turning a blind eye to the real Pravy Sektor
 danger The Tarasenko demands are virtually the same as ex boxer turned
 right wing politician, Vitaly Klitschko, the pro EU apparent
 favorite of Germany s Merkel government Klitschko has lived in
 Germany for the past several years The nominal reason for the latest explosive protests in Ukraine
 was passage of a series of emergency laws to control the civil
 disorder by the Parliament on January 16 which, among other
 things, restrict the right to protest, constrain independent
 media, and inhibit the operation of NGOs Evidence suggests that key players in the Ukraine protest
 movement are being steered and orchestrated by Washington funded
 NGO s like the National Endowment for Democracy, the German
 Marshall Fund in The United States (a Washington think tank
 financed by a donation from the German Parliament), and certain
 key neo conservative Bush Cheney leftovers in senior positions at
 the State Department Already on October 11, 2011, the German Marshall Fund hosted
 Vitaly Klitschko, then WBC Heavyweight Boxing Champion just
 entering Ukraine s political boxing ring, at a Washington meeting
 to discuss Ukraine s European perspective Again in 2012 during the October Ukraine elections The German
 Marshall Fund in the United States hosted a top level group of
 UK, French and German journalists to visit Ukraine, where they
 also met Klitschko The Marshall Fund journalists were told by
 the US Embassy officials in Kiev that, Ukrainian oligarchs
 would like to see a strong opposition to the Party of Regions in
 the new parliament in order to temper the enrichment of President
 Yanukovich s family ù That strong opposition is today headed by three very
 different political parties One which won a shocking 10 percent
 in the last elections and sits in parliament is Svoboda, a
 neo fascist nationalist party led by Oleg Tyagnibok Tyagnibok
 backed the US financed 2004 orangerevolution He is openly
 anti Semitic and anti Russian, once claiming that Ukraine was
 ruled by a Moscow Jewish mafia ùThe second largest
 opposition party, jailed opposition figure, Yulia Tymoshenko s Fatherland , led by Arseny Yatsenyuk, has signed an
 agreement to work with the neo fascist Svoboda The opposition figure most attractive to the West is ex boxer
 Klitschko, head of UDAR (strike), the smallest opposition party,
 who has spent the last years living in Germany In order to have
 a chance at a Parliamentary majority in 2015, Klitschko will be
 forced to make a coalition with Svoboda and its policies, even
 though he is trying a delicate tightrope act of claiming to
 distance from Svoboda s anti Semitic ultra nationalism In an Op Ed in the London Financial Times, Klitschko wrote, the official halt in Ukraine s European integration unmasks
 the true face ùof the Yanukovich regime î a cartel of
 commercial self interests that has captured public office and
 believes that political longevity can be bought by selling
 Ukraine s interests ùUkrainians, he warned, would not allow
 Yanukovich and his cronies to steal their future ùand
 if their views were not taken into account, more protests
 are yet to come ù A central role in encouraging the Ukraine protesters is being
 played by the US State Department, and especially Victoria
 Nulland A review of the official statements from Nulland, who met
 personally with opposition leader Klitschko in early December, is
 instructive of the open interference of Washington in the
 internal affairs of Ukraine Nulland a Hillary Clinton
 appointee who now is assistant secretary of the Bureau of
 European and Eurasian Affairs in the State Department did not
 respect a sovereign decision by Ukraine s government in November
 2013 not to accept the dismal terms offered by Brussels for a
 Ukrainian EU Association status The EU offer would have forced Ukraine to open its
 economy to free market rules in return for little 
 When Yanukovich told the EU of his government s decision in
 November, Nulland s spokesperson issued the following statement: We continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian
 people to achieve a prosperous European democracy European
 integration is the surest course to economic growth and
 strengthening Ukraine s democracy ùThat was an undiplomatic
 intervention on the side of the protesters designed to embolden
 the opposition It did indeed Then on December 5 in Kiev, after her meeting with Vitaly
 Klitschko, Nulland declared, There should be no doubt about
 where the United States stands on this We stand with the people
 of Ukraine who see their future in Europe ¶ ù She followed her speech with a high profile bizarre media
 photo op where she carried a single plastic bag of food to give
 to the opposition demonstrators Nulland s partisan pro EU
 comments were followed by a brazen appearance from Republican
 war hawk Senator John McCain a few days later, siding with the
 opposition in December McCain is chairman of the Board of
 National Endowment for Democracy s International Republican
 Institute, which has been in the middle of all US Color
 Revolution destabilizations since 2000 Most recently, on January 15, after attacking Russia for granting
 a vital $15 billion bond purchase to help stabilize Ukraine,
 Nulland all but outlined the standard US government template for
 election tampering that has been done in countless color
 revolutions since the NED s 2000 coup against Yugoslavia s
 Milosevic She told the US Senate, the use of violence and acts of
 repression carried out by government security forces and their
 surrogates have compelled us to make clear publicly and privately
 to the government of Ukraine that we will consider a broad range
 of tools at our disposal if those in positions of authority in
 Ukraine employ or encourage violence against their own
 citizens ù Nulland then issued a direct order to President Yanukovich: We call on him to make it credible through concrete actions
 to restore government accountability, rule of law and engagement
 with Europe and the IMF ùThen, referencing planned 2015
 national Ukraine elections, she added, US pre election
 assistance to Ukraine likely will include programs to support
 citizen oversight of the campaign environment and the conduct of
 the elections, independent media coverage and informed civic
 awareness and participation ùAnd finally, The State
 Department and USAID are reviewing how best to support Ukrainian
 civil society and media ù USAID is widely cited as a cover for CIA operations in foreign
 countries Victoria Nulland herself is a former assistant to Vice President
 Dick Cheney, and married to neo conservative guru, Robert Kagan 
 She was under fire when caught recently lying to the American
 people when she was Hillary Clinton s State Department
 spokesperson Nulland pushed her superiors then to completely
 delete numerous references of extremists linked to Al Qaeda in
 Benghazi and eastern Libya after the assassination of the US
 Ambassador She also persuaded more senior officials to delete
 information on at least five other attacks against foreign
 interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants Washington is clearly out to destabilize the new Ukraine Russia
 economic cooperation by hook or crook On January 22, after
 severe Pravy Sektor violence, the American Embassy in Kiev
 announced it was revoking the visas of several unnamed Ukraine
 Government officials responsible for actions taken against
 protesters in November and December The latest negotiations between the Yanukovich government and the
 three main opposition party leaders îKlitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk
 and Oleg Tyagnibok îhave led to the resignation of Yanukovich s
 Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov and his cabinet, and changes in the
 emergency laws proposed 10 days earlier Nine out of 12
 anti protest laws passed January 16 were repealed At this point, whatever agenda Victoria Nulland s State
 Department may have had in trying to woo Ukraine away from
 Moscow, the internal forces of instability, egged on by vocal
 support from the West, have made the outcome incalculable That
 is certainly not in the true interest of the EU, having a
 critical Central European nation of 45 million ungovernable, and
 a rising nationalist fascist Svoboda led party calling the shots

"22 Jan, 2014",‚ÄãUkrainian opposition and the West ‚Äòplaying with fire siding with extreme nationalists',"There is a danger that the Ukrainian extreme right are serving the political purpose of the apparently moderate leaders, who in fact want a revolution, Mark Almond, professor of history at Oxford University, told RT The so called moderate opposition has desired a rise of
 nationalism during the riots, Almond believes The Orange
 Revolution went wrong in 2004 05 precisely because the mass
 protests were peaceful, they led to a re run of elections, but
 although Yanukovich lost, he lost very narrowly and remained
 a viable political player with a very large body of support, and
 won of course the election in 2010 ùThus, the opponents of
 Yanukovich now recognize that if you simply force fresh
 elections you don t fundamentally change the political
 system ù They want to marginalize Yanukovich and his Party of the
 Regions, his supporters So you need a non constitutional
 revolution Remember one of the opposition television stations is
 now headlined the Revolution station, ùAlmond told RT As an example he mentioned Klitchko s rethoric Vitaly Klitchko spoke in forked tongue: when he talks in
 English or German for the media he talks about the need for
 peaceful protests, the need for fresh elections; but he then says
 to his supporters that Yanukovich is like Ceau»ôescu and Gaddafi 
 If you say that the president of Ukraine is like Gaddafi, what
 you are saying is that he is a dictator that should be lynched as
 Gaddafi was at the end of 2011, ùAlmond said So there is a danger that the extreme right that does exist,
 the extreme nationalists and indeed near Nazi elements, are
 actually serving the political purpose of the apparently moderate
 leaders That is to say they want to overthrow the existing
 state, they don t trust elections, because they fear that even if
 they win the elections there s a sufficiently bigger body of
 support for Yanukovich that his political movement would survive
 and come back again as it did after the failures of the Orange
 revolution, ùhe added Thus, the so called liberals and moderates are playing with
 fire, ùAlmond concludes, saying that the extremist mob now
 clashing with police in the streets might turn against them, too It s a very unstable situation, and I think that Vitaly
 Klitchko, Yatsenyuk, Parshenko these leaders whom the West
 courts are playing with fire, and so is the West, ùAlmond
 believes They want a collapse of Yanukovich s government, a
 revolution of a sort They, of course, then want to glide safely
 into the presidential office and into the seats of power, but
 they will have depended upon the heavy mob, these extreme
 nationalists of Ukraine who chant anti Russian slogans,
 anti Jewish slogans, and who of course have got a taste of
 violence, and, who will see themselves if they are able to
 overthrow Yanukovich, as the people who brought about the
 revolution, ùhe told RT And of course we ve seen in
 the past once you move from having elections as the basis of
 political power to the crowd in the street, to the storming of
 the government buildings, that can slide out of control: the
 people who think they are the leaders today could find themselves
 marginalized, the people who today are willing to use incitements
 to violence by denouncing the current government as being tyrants
 could find themselves being targeted by the same people who are
 throwing Molotov cocktails tomorrow ù Mark Almond also points out that the situation is a
 sinister, cynical political power game about the Ukraine, which
 has implications for the functioning of the constitutions of the
 Western Europe, for the functioning of our own democracy ù I think it is a rather sinister sign not only for Ukraine that
 the democratic countries of the EU and the US, their governments
 and democratic institutions in Brussels, are siding with a
 rioting mob in the streets, ù he said Yanukovich s government refused to sign the association
 agreement with the EU that sparked the protest In other words,
 Yanukovich has a negative rating for the EU and for America; he
 didn t do what we wanted What if a government inside the EU was
 to begin to say that we don t entirely agree with this or that,
 would they also see a sponsored crowd on the streets, would they
 also see inside a country inside the EU a threat to the
 constitutional order if you don t follow the line that the
 bureaucrats in Brussels have laid down, ùAlmond told RT Both governments in Western Europe and the US, as well as
 Ukrainian authorities, must be more aware of the dangers of
 fascism, Nicolai N Petro, professor of political science at the
 University of Rhode Island, believes Whatever noble intentions these protesters might have had,
 they ve been hijacked by very sinister and dark forces, and it is
 sad to see the governments across the border, in Western Europe
 and the US, not understand the dangers of fascism to a government
 that is divided and unwilling to take decisive action, Petro told RT They don t take those ideas very seriously Fascism seems
 like a historical footnote to them, they don t realize that these
 sort of events could be repeated, particularly in governments
 like Ukraine that don t have a long tradition of stable
 democratic politics, he added Petro says that the Ukrainian government should have been more
 decisive in its actions against extremist protestors There s a threshold when authorities decide that the rights
 of protest have moved into a sphere in which it endangers the
 livelihood of the community, and when that determination is made
 the government restrains the most aggressive forcers and tries to
 shunt political activity back into constitutional framework That
 is something that the current Ukrainian government has so far
 failed to do, and I think this is one of the greatest weaknesses
 and the most destabilizing aspect of the current protest the
 government s ineffectiveness The legitimate government s
 ineffectiveness, I should add, Petro concluded ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-west-extreme-nationalists-034/

 legislation by the Ukrainian parliament, which has banned
 unsanctioned gatherings, imposed multiple restrictions on
 demonstrations, the media, and internet and toughened penalties
 for actions like the blocking and seizure of state buildings The bill wassignedinto law by Ukrainian President Viktor
 Yanukovich on Sunday after getting approval from the parliament

 vigorous condemnation from the Western politicians and media,
 which branded the laws undemocratic ùThe new legislation includes authority to arrest protesters who
 wear masks or helmets, or erect tents or stages without
 permission from the authorities, criminalization of libel and the
 distribution of extremist materials, including via the internet,

"19 Dec, 2013",‚ÄòLand of Oz‚Äô: Ukraine slipping into far-right hands,"With growing popularity of neo Nazi Oleg Tyahnybok, leader of the Ukrainian far right Svoboda party, Ukraine is falling into an extremely dangerous situation, journalist and blogger Graham Phillips told RT We are looking at a tinder box which might go up and we are
 looking at a man [Tyahnybok] who s standing there and waiting for
 that to happen, ùPhillips said, describing the current
 situation in Ukraine At the moment, the landscape of Ukrainian politics can be
 compared to the Wizard of Oz, ùhe said You ve got three leaders: you ve got [Vitaly] Klichko,
 [Arseniy] Yatsenyuk and [Oleg] Tyahnybok, and of course you ve
 got Timoshenko if you like And they all are missing something:
 Klichko doesn t have intelligence, but he has charisma, Yatsenyuk
 has intelligence, but he has no charisma, Tyahnybok has
 intelligence and charisma but he is an extremely dangerous
 Neo Nazi figure And Timoshenko is still pulling the strings and
 still orchestrating things from behind bars, but where she fits
 into the whole picture is not clear ù Klichko and Yatsenyuk are the guys at the front, very much
 on the stage, in front of the camera, ùand what you ve got
 behind it is only Tyahnybok, Phillips told RT Back in the
 October 2012 elections when Tyahnybok didn t really capitalize,
 his party only got around 40 MPs in the Rada, but now Tyahnybok
 is a strong politician who s waiting for his moment to seize
 power, Phillips said Tyahnybok is waiting for the other leaders to knock
 themselves out and then he s going to step over them to seize
 control It s a very big likelihood He is just staying behind,
 observing the situation and he s quite prepared to let his
 enemies rip out each other s throats He s in a very powerful
 position and has a dominating role in Ukrainian politics He s
 taking a back seat but he is waiting and playing a waiting game,
 waiting for the right time to make his move Believe me, he has
 something up his sleeve, and this is something intrinsic in terms
 of the future of Ukraine, ùhe said If the future of Ukraine is Tyahnybok, you are looking at an
 extremely dangerous situation, Phillips said, whereby Ukraine
 would move closer to the EU under the opposition Tyahnybok and Svoboda party are far right, in fact even
 further right than the Golden Dawn party in Greece You are
 looking at Ukraine falling in the hands of the man who is one of
 the most far right leaders in world politics ù As for Yatsenyuk, he is an extremely ambitious man, who declared
 his intention to be president back in 2009, Phillips told RT 
 Nevertheless, Yatsenyuk s position is not that strong as
 Yushchenko s was at the time of the orangerevolution , or
 Tyahnybok s position now The issue that Yatsenyuk has is that he himself is not a
 popular figure, he isn t a popular leader He is an a leader who
 has inspired Ukrainians at this time when the country is really
 crying out for a figure to come forward to give them some kind of
 an inspiration, the way that Yushchenko did at the time of the
 orangerevolution , ùPhillips said There is also a problem with Klichko, Phillips said Klitschko is
 a young man of 42, but he doesn t have the degree of intelligence
 required to lead the country And more than that, Klichko isn t a
 man who really has charisma That s something that has been
 apparent during the EuroMaidan gatherings, because whenever
 [Klichko] appeared there has never been a high degree of
 enthusiasm from the public I think Ukrainians would like to like
 Klichko more than they really do, ùPhillips said The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/extremism-danger-for-ukrainian-future-497/

"10 Dec, 2013",From Russian invasion to colored Statue of Liberty: Hoaxes fuel Ukrainian protest,"Although they have lasted for two weeks, the protests in Ukraine are far from losing their steam Among the things keeping the crowd s anger alive are media hoaxes With tensions running high in Kiev, their consequences are ever harder to predict Having to endure freezing temperatures on the streets of Kiev is
 not the worst the protesters and police have been through since
 the rallies broke out in the Ukrainian capital in late November,
 following President Yanukovich s refusal to sign an integration
 agreement with the EU A violent crackdown on the rally participants by the Berkut
 special police forces on the night of November 30, instead of
 suffocating the protest only multiplied the number of its
 participants and strengthened their resolve Standoffs between police and protesters have become a daily
 routine for the Ukrainian capital, which is looking like a war
 zone with its camp of protesters in the very center and
 barricades around major government buildings Each side claims
 dozens of injured in the clashes Every few hours Ukraine s opposition reports police have
 begun an assault on the protesters, so every few hours the
 tension is ratcheted up another notch, ùRT s Paul Scott
 reports from Kiev In a situation as precarious as this, any news might become
 explosive fertile ground for hoaxing Like the one, that emerged straight after the December 6 meeting
 between Viktor Yanukovich s and Vladimir Putin Media reported
 that the Ukrainian president had agreed to join Russia s Customs
 Union The reports hardened the resolve of many on Independence
 Square (Maidan Nelalezhnosti) The story was immediately denied by Moscow and Kiev, but among
 the protesters it fell on deaf ears The rumor of the Russia Ukraine agreement was followed by more
 outrageous ones One minute it was claimed that Russia was going
 to cross the border and help stamp out the protests The next
 stated that special forces were being shipped in from all over
 Ukraine, and tanks were rumbling their way into central Kiev Mark Almond, Professor of history at Oxford University told RT,
 that he had seen it all before Those who remember the so called orangerevolution in 2004
 would remember we were told then that there were Russian special
 forces lurking in the woods near Kiev, waiting to crack down 
 There weren t, nothing happened, ùAlmond said So we re
 seeing a kind of a propaganda war psychological war taking
 place, using these rumors of crackdown and even foreign
 interference ù On Monday, several Ukrainian news outlets reported on foreign
 countries acts of support for the protesters out on the streets
 of Kiev It was said that Washington s Statue of Liberty and
 Rio s Statue of Christ the Redeemer had been lit up by blue and
 yellow lights, representing the colors of the Ukrainian flag The
 pictures of the events jumped from a personal Facebook account to
 the official Twitter of a major opposition political party and
 then to news agencies Only it wasn t news Rather an experiment to show how easy it was
 to manipulate public opinion The pictures were actually
 photoshoped by a Ukrainian blogger and occasional online
 prankster, Den Alampiev I decided to see how people are consuming hoax news, ùhe wrote on his web page It took me two minutes to make
 fake photos of the Statue of Liberty and the Statue of Christ I
 wrote a short description and posted on Facebook, Vkontakte

 photo spread across the social media ù The effect actually exceeded Den s expectations Hundreds of
 Facebook likes were one thing, but the lighting trick ù soon led
 to a much more serious result It was even retweeted on the official twitter page of the
 opposition party Fatherland as real news, with a comment that the
 whole world is supporting Ukrainian protesters ù,Alampiev
 told RT People camping out on Maidan don t check this information

"9 Dec, 2013",'Parade of losers': EU delegation to Kiev threatens democracy,"Far from promoting EU values and democracy the European delegation to Ukraine threatens democratic process, Professor Mark Almond told RT in his extensive analysis of the events in Kiev RT:The German chancellor and the French
 foreign minister say they want to meet with Ukrainian opposition
 leader Vitaly Klitschko and support his presidential ambitions 
 Do they see an exit for Yanukovich as a done deed, then?Mark Almond:Well I think they hope so, and I think this
 is what is deeply problematic because in addition to the double
 standards that the EU leaders are showing when very little has
 taken place in Kiev that could remotely justify foreign
 intervention there There have been no deaths There have been a
 few heads hit with truncheons But when we think about the deaths
 that took place in other countries where the European leaders
 ignored or even colluded with regimes that did this Egypt for
 instance this summer, when perhaps 1,000 people were killed 
 it s very striking the double standards and I think this is also
 a threat to our democracy domestically In the EU countries, if crowds on the street are to determine
 that the government that may be unpopular in the midterm should
 fall, where does that stop? If that crowd is stimulated with
 foreign support, foreign cash; I m afraid to say that in my
 misspent youth I use to help take money and computers and all
 sorts of equipment to dissidents in Eastern Europe, so I know
 that perhaps the fairytale picture of just the people rising up
 rather looks how the people were stimulated to rise up, how there
 is a media campaign, how there is support base system that
 requires money for instance And that comes I am afraid from the
 EU countries, in major part RT:Several EU officials are supporting the
 anti government rallies in Ukraine but shouldn t they be
 focusing on problems closer to home with the major protests
 we ve been witnessing in Greece, Spain and Italy?MA:First of all that would admit that a lot of
 policies they support, and policies by the way they wish to
 impose on Ukraine, very stringent austerity policies, hikes in
 the price of gas, electricity and so on, 40 percent, that those
 are deeply unpopular inside Europe and they are in a sense saying
 that we are representing some kind of ideals abroad in Ukraine 
 And I think again, this is again, it s double standards Hypocrisy of course is terribly displeasing, but it also masks
 this problem of contempt for the ordinary people Because once
 you d say that what should determine who rules is the crowd in
 the street, not the ballot box, then of course, in almost any
 society there are reasons why 50 70,000 people might be
 discontent with the government, might go into the streets if they
 get sympathetic coverage in the media, you could inflate the
 numbers to hundreds of thousands But even hundreds of thousands
 are only a small number in a country of 46 million people And I
 think whether it is Ukraine today, whether it could be Italy or
 Spain tomorrow, once you start saying that the ballot box can be
 trumped by the street that is a deep threat to democracy Far
 from promoting EU values and democracy and the rule of law, we
 seem to be able to throw them out the window in order to get our
 man into power RT:The EU failed to convince Yanukovich
 that the trade deal was good for Ukraine In backing the
 protesters, are they hoping to undermine his government? MA:I think there is an attempt through a rumor
 mill to create a heightened sense of tension and alarm Those who
 remember the so called orangerevolution in 2004 will remember we
 were told then that there were Russian Spetznaz special force
 lurking in the woods near in Kiev waiting to crack down They
 weren t Nothing happened In fact Mr Yanukovich accepted what
 could be regarded as a kind of electorate coup de tat then, when
 after all pressure was put to re stage the elections So if
 anything, his credentials of being a person willing to accept the
 electorate process are better than his opponents, who have always
 cried foul when they ve lost and tried to get foreign support to
 reverse the election results RT:EU officials say they support the
 democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people but what we re
 seeing are vandalism and squatting in administrative buildings
 is that democracy? MA:So we are seeing a kind of propaganda war,
 psychological war taking place using these rumors of both the
 crackdown domestically and even foreign interference Whilst at
 the same time, the very Western media and Western governments
 who report these rumors completely ignore the evidence of their
 own involvement in supporting the opposition, providing
 technical training camps, providing financial and other forms
 of assistance, providing a media platform for them Of course one has to say that although there was a relatively
 large crowd in the Kiev today, it was far below the demand for
 a million people Well below: probably 150,000 So there is a
 body of activists but it does not seem yet to have attracted
 even a significant body or majority support in Kiev, let along
 in the wider country which remains remarkably passive, in fact 
 Of course the average person in Ukraine, I m afraid to say, has
 considerable economic difficulties, has reasons to be thinking
 ahead preparing for the winter, preparing to deal with the
 problems of electricity and gas bills, which incidentally of
 course will be massively raised if the policy promoted by the
 West is adopted, the policy demanded by the IMF actually wants
 a 40 percent increase in those electricity and gas bills I
 find it quite extraordinary that that issue is not asked about
 when Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, and Fabius, the
 French foreign minister, and so on address these questions How
 are ordinary Ukrainians to deal with the European values
 they ve been asked to subscribe too, which actually involves
 them committing economic suicide? RT:Is Ukraine really the priority for the
 EU here or is it just being used as a pawn in a bigger
 game? MA:Well first of all we see a parade of
 losers coming to Kiev Westerwelle, the German foreign
 minister s party was annihilated in the recent German election 
 It s lost all of its seats Kaczy≈Ñski the former Polish prime
 minister is a loser Saakashvili , the [former] president of
 Georgia reviled by the population for his brutality and torture
 in his prisons are coming because it gives them a sense of self
 importance But also they are coming because the European power
 centers, the organization in Brussels, NATO and so on, see
 Ukraine as a key strategic factor They want Ukraine to be under their thumb, under NATO s thumb,
 because they are deeply hostile to Russia And they don t want
 to accept, of course in Ukraine there are diverse range of
 opinions of people that are pro Russian, people who are
 anti Russian But Ukraine happens to sit next to Russia as well
 as to Poland And instead they want to draw it into the Western
 sphere of influence And I m afraid, these retired, failed
 politicians are being presented to the public, Westerwelle,
 Saakashvili and so on, as representatives of the enormously
 rich and powerful West So it s slightly intimidating in fact
 if you are a person in a country that s not terribly rich, not
 terribly powerful to suddenly have a collective bate of the
 NATO/EU countries bearing down on you and sort of saying, you
 must behave and you must adopt these policies Even though, in fact nobody voted in the election, that were
 only last year in 2012 nobody voted on the proposals that are
 now supposed to be at the center of this crisis This was very
 secret Nobody was told what they were I suspect that the
 average person in Ukraine knows very little of what the
 so called Association Agreement involved But it is being
 pushed back by rhetoric about ""Do you want to join the rich and
 affluent West?"" The implication being that the rich and
 affluent West and the Europeans will pay for you, but we know
 they won t pay for the Greek health service, they won t pay for
 the Spanish health service So why should they pay for the
 welfare of Ukrainians? I think it is rather misleading and
 cynical propaganda campaign sadly is being staged But I think
 that many Ukrainians seem to be rather immune to it

 verbal interviews, this is not being orchestrated by the people
 of Ukraine I have reports from Ukrainian ordinary citizens that
 I have been in contact with over the weekend The students and the unemployed, people who are just out and out
 and alcoholics and so on, are being paid something like 20 30
 euros a day by who knows who, we can only speculate, to come in
 to Kiev and make these huge demonstrations to make a show of
 force And then the fact that Victoria Nuland of all people, one of the
 most outrageous neoconservatives of the Bush era, the former US
 ambassador to NATO, comes and encourages the Ukrainian people to
 demonstrate for freedom and join the European Union, this is
 hypocrisy RT:Just for a minute imagine the same thing
 happened in America?WE:Yeah Imagine that Putin and a few European
 leaders were coming and say what is this for a violation of free
 speech, when people are arrested for protesting on Occupy Wall
 Street, or whatever RT:There s been a spate of protests across
 EU nations over austerity in recent months why didn t we see
 these same European politicians visiting the demonstrators in
 those countries like they are in Ukraine now?WE:Well no, because the EU s agenda is to
 enforce austerity on Greece, Spain, Portugal and so forth and
 bleed them for the banks So it is a very hypocritical agenda 
 Westerwelle, the German Foreign Minister pedalling into Ukrainian
 internal affairs But I think it s beginning to become little bit obvious that this
 is an agenda to try to split Ukraine from Russia And perhaps at
 the last minute the government did realize that not only it s
 going to be a catastrophe for Ukraine, but that they would not
 get anything positive from special status with the European
 Union The EU is bankrupt, they have nothing to offer What are they
 going to give Ukraine, for God sakes?RT:The heads of Ukraine s nationalist

 Victoria Nuland is part and parcel of, has a dirty hand in this,

"4 Dec, 2013",'Sizeable proportion of Ukrainians would resist another Orange Revolution',"Yanukovich s position is nowhere near as shaken as that of the pre orangerevolution government was when it fell in 2004, foreign affairs author Srdja Trifkovic told RT With the protests in Kiev continuing, Ukrainian Prime Minister
 Nikolay Azarov has called on his opponents and thousands of
 street protesters to de escalate the tension and negotiate He
 said that the government is ready for dialogue On Tuesday, the Ukrainian government survived a vote of no
 confidence initiated by opposition MPs in the Verkhovna Rada Meanwhile, President Yanukovich left Ukraine for planned trips to
 China and Russia, in search of a financial aid for Ukraine s near
 bankrupt economy RT:Could current protests lead to regime change like
 it was during the orangerevolution ? Srdja Trifkovic:In my opinion the government in Kiev is
 much more stable today than the Kuchma s establishment was in the
 fall of 2004 Even if we look at the maximum number that has
 reportedly turned up for protest in Kiev, in Lvov, in the west
 and elsewhere, we are talking about 1 percent of Ukraine s
 population In 2004 the Kuchma establishment was so thoroughly discredited,
 in particular after the famous cassette affair of 2000, there was
 hardly anyone willing or ready to stand up in defense of the
 existing government So effectively the orangerevolution ,
 lavishly funded from the West as it happened, didn t have much
 resistance It wasn t really facing an organized or self confident government
 that could count on the sizeable percentage of the Ukrainian
 population to resist the Orange tidal wave Today it s no longer
 the case Today I think that in spite of all problems that
 Yanukovich has had domestically of the past three and a half
 years, his position is nowhere near as shaken † as that of
 the pre Orange government had been in the fall of 2004 At the same time Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, general secretary of the
 Council of Europe, left for Ukraine to take part in meeting
 of the Ukrainian prime minister, foreign minister and
 parliamentary parties aimed at discussing the current
 situation and finding a solution RT:We are seeing organized groups of rioters that seem
 to provoke the police Opposition and the government blame each
 other for this Who do you think is really behind those
 groups? ST:We need to ask the question who gains? And it s
 obvious that the government has nothing to gain by escalating
 violence The government is actually hoping that it will
 gradually die down The only people who have a vested interest in
 provoking violence are the protesters themselves, or to put it
 more precisely, those who are behind the organized aspect of the
 protests, because it would work wonders both in the Western media
 and in the entire anti Yanukovich segment of the Ukrainian
 population to have the martyrs of the so called peaceful protest,
 who are being suddenly beaten savagely by the police No, that scenario simply doesn t sound convincing In my opinion,
 the violence that has been instigated is perhaps by the fringe
 elements of the protesters but certainly not by the government
 because they have nothing to gain RT:Yanukovich said there are plans for further
 discussion of the shelf deal with EU Has he caved in to the
 protesters then? ST:No, he has not caved because he s been saying all
 along that the road to European integration is not over and
 negotiations will continue He is simply unhappy with the fact
 that at this moment of the time the EU didn t offer a sufficient
 economic and financial inducement for Ukraine to take this path
 because the cost of Ukraine adjusting itself to European rules
 and regulations would be enormous and the benefits would become
 visible only 10 years down the road And God only knows if the EU
 will even exist in 10 years hence RT:Should Ukraine rethink its position and sign the EU
 deal? What s the EU s interest? ST:The EU is only interested in the geopolitical aspect
 of drawing Ukraine away from Russia, and in this context with
 Poland and Germany finally finding the common front that we
 should look at the whole scenario On the other hand, the EU
 wanted to get Ukraine for nothing They were not prepared to open
 the purse, they were not even prepared to relend even on the
 unreasonable demand that Yulia Tymoshenko be not only set free,
 but allowed to go abroad for medical treatment For Ukraine to rethink and sign would be indeed I wouldn t like
 to use a dramatic word like suicidal but it ll definitely be
 self defeating It would cost Ukraine tens of billion dollars or
 euro without any tangible benefits for many years to come 
 Ukraine in its fragile current economic position simply cannot
 afford to sign a deal of that kind RT:What if the rethinking happens as a result of the
 revolution? Will the EU still accept a partner after such
 unrest? ST:First of all, I don t think it s a realistic scenario
 because if there is a pro EU near orangerevolution , there would
 be a pro Customs Union, pro Russian counterrevolution So it
 would be the path to a civil war In the industrial basin of the
 east they know that if they join the EU package (of course they
 will never join the EU itself), they would lose customs
 privileges in Russia and their industrial goods which are still
 being exported to Russia in increasing quantities will suddenly
 become 35 percent more expensive, which would price them out of
 the market At the same time I doubt very much that the EU
 countries would suddenly express an interest in buying Ukrainian
 industrial goods So the premise of the question is false, there will be no
 revolution Even if there is an attempt at the violent overthrow
 of the government, there would be definitely a very sizeable
 counterforce ready to come on the streets It is no longer 2004
 when no one was willing to risk their skin for Kuchma RT:Yanukovich has been accusing Russia and the EU in
 terms of putting pressure on Ukraine Is he just trying to play
 both sides? ST:It is not to say that there have not been various
 forms of pressure from both sides It is indeed remarkable that
 after the cooling of relations between Yanukovich and Putin in
 recent years, he has suddenly realized that key national
 interests have to come before personal likes and dislikes There
 will be more pressure from both sides in various forms, but it is
 simply politics as usual There is no free lunch and both Brussels and Moscow will offer
 their terms, and it is up to Ukraine to decide which set of terms
 is more favorable I think to a reasonable person it s pretty
 obvious that the Customs Union and Russian market are the ones
 who offer more tangible and more viable sets of benefits for
 Ukraine, which needs economic relief very badly indeed RT:Can Ukraine actually benefit from both the
 partnerships with EU and Russia? ST:Ukraine could benefit from the best of both worlds if
 it was on offer, but it is not You simply cannot have your cake
 and have it at the same time Joining the euro enthusiasts would
 simply mean that you can no longer enjoy certain benefits that
 otherwise are on offer Joining the Customs Union and
 strengthening relations with Russia means that Brussels will be

 a debt default soaring higher on Tuesday, the Financial Times
 reports The yield on the government s benchmark bond maturing in
 September 2020 rose to 10 87 percent, with the yield on its bond
 maturing in June 2014 going up more than 16 percent from Monday s
 close, according to Bloomberg During the three day visit, Ukraine will sign a number of
 economic cooperation agreements, including possible investment
 deals Yanukovych may be chasing a Chinese solution ù to temporarily
 prevent an economic rupture at home The government faces $15 3
 billion in maturing loans that will further deplete the Central
 Bank s currency reserves As of October 31, Ukraine s
 international reserves dropped to $20 6 billion, according to
 Bloomberg data The Central Bank intervening to repay debts will
 threaten the financial stability and the value of the grivnya,
 Ukraine s currency We continue to believe that large scale financial assistance
 from either Russia or China is not likely to be forthcoming and
 that a key short term risk stems from a possible acceleration in
 capital outflows, Goldman Sachs wrote in a December 3 note Beijing has already given Ukraine $10 billion worth of loans,
 Reuters reported, citing Volodymyr Fesenko of Ukraine s Penta
 think tank Ukraine s Finance Minister Yuri Kolobov reassured investors that
 the country is a reliable borrower ùwith a flawless
 record of meeting all its obligations on time ùhe said on
 Ukrainian state television Tuesday, urging everyone to remain
 confident ùin the banking system Ukraine s first Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Arbuzov, who took an
 official trip to China last September, confirmed Ukraine is
 interested in attracting new investment from China In September, the South China Morning PostreportedChina s Xinjiang Production and
 Construction Corporation (XPCC) plans to lease 5 percent of
 Ukraine s total landmass to grow crops and farm pigs on a 50 year
 lease Food demand in China is expected to grow along with
 industrialization, and China has been land grabbing across the
 globe, with 7 4 million acres (3 million hectares) in Ukraine
 being the most recent The news caught ministers in Kiev by
 surprise, who knew nothing of thedeal Ukraine lifted a ban on foreigners
 buying land last year The next destination for President Viktor Yanukovych will be the
 country s closest ally, Russia, where the countries hope to
 normalize the roadmap of cooperation, which will imply normal
 trade and economic regime, Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov
 said Russia is Ukraine s mainsourceof energy, loans and trade, with Russia
 importing nearly 25 percent of Ukraine s export goods On Tuesday Gazprom, who has been demanding Ukraine hand over more
 than $1 billion in late gas payments immediately, has extended
 the deadline for Ukraine s state run Naftogaz until spring,
 Interfax reported Naftogaz chief Yevhen Bakulin as saying We have agreed to shift our payments for October, November
 and December to next spring, Bakulin said Although Russia has repeatedly warned Kiev it will end trade
 benefits in case it signs a trade association deal with the EU,
 Ukraine remainscaughtbetween Russia and the EU Ukraine will send
 delegations to both the EU and Moscow to restore trade
 economic relations, ùAzarov said Tuesday If Yanukovych loses power to the opposition at home, the deal
 from Russia could be off the table, according to a December 2
 note from Goldman Sachs We think that Russia is unlikely to extend substantial help
 without guarantees Given that it appears that President
 Yanukovych s chances of holding on to power beyond the 2015
 spring election have decreased following the protests and schisms
 in his administration might even weaken his powers earlier, ùthe note said Alexander Razuvaev, Research Director at Alpari Forex Group, is
 confident Ukraine will get the money from either the EU, the IMF
 or Russia, and won t default or turn to China It is clear that Ukraine cannot pay off its debts on its own,
 and the probability of a sovereign default is relatively high 
 However, in my opinion, in any scenario, it will not default It
 will either receive aid from the EU, IMF, or Russia, ùBusiness FM online reports Prime Minister Azarov remained in Kiev where his ruling party
 survived a vote of no confidence by opposition parliament members
 following the biggest street protests since the orangerevolution 
 in 2004 Only 186 MPs voted for the motion, well short of the
 simple majority of 226 needed for it to pass Thousands of
 activists and police clashed outside Afterwards the president will visit Russia, where we also
 plan to sign and formalize the road map of cooperation, which
 will imply the establishment of a normal trade and economic
 regime, Azarov said At the emergency vote in Kiev, Azarov said he plans to send a
 delegation to Brussels next week to work on further EU trade

"3 Dec, 2013","‚ÄòDespite rumors of a coup, another Orange revolution in Ukraine is unlikely'","Pro western forces in Ukraine will find it hard to provoke a new revolution, particularly as a potential EU trade agreement would not affect the constitution, John Laughland, director of studies at the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation, told RT RT:The Ukrainian parliament is right now debating a
 government no confidence vote Would you bet on the prime
 minister and his Cabinet in this situation? John Laughland:I probably would I think the rumors of a
 coup are to be taken with some seriousness but I would be
 surprised if the events of 2004, the orangerevolution , could be
 repeated I think Hegel said, or was it Marx, History repeats
 itself first as tragedy and then as farce I think it will
 be difficult for the pro western forces in Ukraine to pull off
 the same trick twice, particularly since clearly this decision
 about the trade agreement with Europe is only a decision about
 the trade agreement The issue is not something constitutional,
 like an election, as it was nearly 10 years ago RT:Some senior EU politicians rushed to Kiev to
 express their support for the opposition What s your take on
 this is such interference in the country s internal affairs
 justified? JL:Absolutely not It s absolutely disgraceful for
 European politicians to travel this way as they did 10 years ago,
 when members of the European Parliament, other people from the
 EU, including particularly Polish representatives, played a very
 important role in disrupting the electoral process back at the
 time of the orangerevolution What is very important for people
 to understand is that the European leaders, the European elite
 genuinely consider themselves to be more civilized and more
 politically advanced than anywhere else in the world In this
 respect they are often compared to early Bolsheviks They really
 think they are in the avant garde of history and they think that
 any country such as Ukraine and even Russia, which is not
 interested in following their particular political and economic
 model, is backward, reactionary and dangerous, and that s why
 they are inspired with an almost revolutionary zeal The EU
 report used the word revolution ù and it was bandied around
 again They are really convinced that they are in the avant garde
 of history and that what gives them a dangerous drive RT:In case the government does step down, do you think
 that will be enough to soothe the opposition and quell the
 protests or on the contrary, inspire them to demand more
 changes? JL:I m not convinced that the government will fall,
 though I m in a long way away from the events in Ukraine I
 think, unfortunately, that as long as Europe continues with its
 geopolitical project, which is to constitute itself as the center
 of gravity in Europe and to draw non European countries into its
 orbit, to extend its sphere of influence as far as possible into
 Eastern Europe, and deep, of course, into historic Russia As
 long as Europe continues this geopolitical program, these
 problems and tensions will continue And of course they will
 particularly continue in Ukraine Ukraine is the biggest prize,
 but it is also the most difficult prize Other smaller countries
 like Georgia are fairly easy to take over So as long as Europe
 continues with its march to the East, I think these tensions will
 continue On the other hand, it s not clear for how long Europe
 will be able to continue to exercise this fascination as it
 undoubtedly does in certain parts of Ukraine because everybody
 knows that European model itself is in deep crisis Everybody
 knows that in southern Europe the euro has inflicted terrible
 economic damage, youth unemployment is over 50 percent in Spain,
 etc Europe will cease to have attraction increasingly, at least
 for people who look at things factually rather than with
 emotions, as many people are doing RT:One of the most vocal supporters of the protests
 we ve heard from is the Polish opposition leader Yaroslaw
 Kaczinsky He is known as a staunch critic of the EU Why would
 he support Ukraine s integration deal with the very bloc that
 he s so against? JL:He is a staunch critic, as you said He was a bit like
 the British Conservative Party, who made euro skeptic noises, as
 the Kaczinski brothers did when they were in power, but in fact
 never doing anything against Europe On the contrary, they ve
 always been fervent supporters of Polish accession And they
 above all see this integration of Ukraine into the European Union
 as a geopolitical victory for Poland It s very important to
 emphasize the role of Poles specifically in the process with
 Ukraine Poland has always regarded Ukraine as its backyard, it
 has neo imperialist designs on Ukraine, it wants Ukraine to come
 mainly into its orbit, not even a European orbit And that s why
 Polish leaders, former President Kwa≈õniewski and others have
 taken such a role in this So there is no incompatibility between
 Kaczinsky s professed euro skepticism and his deep desire to
 affect this radical geopolitical change, which would be
 represented by Ukrainian accession to this agreement The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukrainian-revolution-not-to-happen-650/
"2 Dec, 2013",‚ÄòNo going back for Yanukovich now‚Äô,"If the Ukrainian president goes back on the deal with the EU, he ll disappoint his supporters and he s obviously not going to regain the support of those who are protesting, author and blogger Anatoly Karlin told RT The political conflict in Ukraine has reached boiling
 point, Martin McCauley, author and Russia analyst, told
 RT The government is in danger because the economy is
 weak and living standards are poor, McCauley said He
 claims that the riot police are in a very difficult
 position; they have to decide whether to use force against
 protesters If they believe Yanukovich will survive, then
 they can use force and perhaps crack a few heads If they
 begin to believe that the government will fall, then they
 will draw back as they don t want to be blamed by the next
 government for this violence The same refers to the military
 they also have to think twice RT:President Yanukovich is being accused of betraying
 national interests by turning down the EU deal, but he says it s
 bad for the economy Do you agree with Yanukovich and what are
 his options at this point? Anatoly Karlin:We have to look at this objectively What
 the EU was offering was $600 million for many years and perhaps
 some help with negotiating an IMF loan TheIMF loanwas much bigger, $16 billion , but it came
 with some conditions such as † salary freeze, spending cuts,
 40 percent rise in gas prices With the elections coming up in March 2015, Yanukovich simply
 cannot afford to accede to those demands, especially since the EU
 is demanding a lot, but isn t giving a lot For instance, there
 is no visa free travel; free trade between Europe and Ukraine
 will destroy a lot of heavy industry, especially in the eastern
 part of the country, where Yanukovich and the Party of Regions
 have a lot of their electorate On the other hand, young people who are more disposed against
 Yanukovich are not to going to get the labor movement, they are
 going to be able to emigrate to Athens and Dublin, they are going
 to vote against them instead So it s not surprising that
 Yanukovich rejected the EU deal simply because Russia is offering
 better conditions in terms of money, about $10 billion, when the
 EU says $600 million RT:What can Yanukovich do at this point? He has
 perhaps these reasoned arguments for not wanting a deal with the
 EU, but here are hundreds of thousands of people on the streets,
 he has to deal with them somehow What do you think is the best
 move? AK:I think he s got to seek [a diplomatic way] out, there
 is no going back now If he does go back, then he is also going
 to disappoint his system s supporters, who support his current
 course and he is obviously not going to get back the support of
 those who are protesting Another thing we have to bear in mind
 is that even the orangerevolution in 2004 was not made by the
 street, it was made by a court judgment which ruled that the
 elections were illegitimate and called for new elections RT:The EU agreement could still be revisited later 
 Why did the opposition choose violent protests instead of having
 more dialogue about the pros and cons of integration with the
 EU? AK:I think because, first of all, slogans work better
 than decent arguments about the economics, which frankly don t
 interest too many people Secondly, it appears to be basically
 that Eastern Ukrainians support the Party of Regions they are
 more politically apathetic in general, whereas Central Ukrainians
 and Western Ukrainians are willing to go out, protest and make
 their voices heard The opposition really has the sense to go out
 and galvanize people RT:Who do you think stands to benefit from this
 unrest? Is there more to these protests than just a trade
 deal? AK:I don t think anybody stands to benefit First of all,
 although these protests went off peacefully, today [Sunday] they
 went into the other direction, we had those hilarious scenes of
 the bulldozer trying to plow into the police forces guarding
 government buildings in Kiev and Molotov cocktails being thrown
 at police, and although this makes good TV footage, there is also
 going to be a lot of people who are staying at their homes, who
 are witnessing this, who will be turned off by this violence I don t think this will benefit the opposition in the long term,
 once tempers cool down Another winter is coming, it s getting
 colder, people aren t willing to stand out in the cold to protest
 during January It s obviously not doing any good for Ukrainian
 economy either because it s in a poorly enough state as it is,
 there s debt repayments coming up and it would really be in its
 favor of Ukraine to focus more on technocratic economic side as
 opposed to these political games The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/violent-protests-in-ukraine-595/
"2 Dec, 2013","Revolution template: Ukrainian protests follow Serbian, Georgian paths","It looks as if protesters in Ukraine can topple the government, and it s not clear whether the president has the stomach or the intellect to control the situation there, Mark Almond, an Oxford University historian, told RT Almond believes that these protests are part of Ukraine s
 economic difficulties But association with Europe would
 stimulate an economic downturn and more mass migration, rather
 than reform process, which would improve life, he believes RT:It does look like protesters would like to topple
 the government Do you think it is likely to happen? Mark Almond:It is possible There is a template that they
 are following, which happened in Belgrade in Serbia in 2000 and
 in Georgia in 2003: storm public buildings, hope to face a
 demoralized government And it has to be said that the president
 of Ukraine zigzagged so much not just over Europe, but over the
 question of policing and it is not quite clear whether he has the
 stomach or the intellect to control the situation there RT:It s not the first time we are seeing a revolution
 there What difference would a second one make? MA:This seems to be a great tragedy of Ukraine It would
 seem that Ukrainians can t learn from their own experience After
 all, we had in 2004 05 the so called orangerevolution , and it
 actually gave way to in fighting, to terrible corruption, to
 economic disaster that s what actually enabled Yanukovich to
 win the election and come back to power We have to be careful
 with attributing what is going to the majority of people in
 Ukraine I suspect the tragedy of the Ukrainians is that the
 great majority of people are rather passive and certainly rather
 disillusioned about politics on both sides of the equation The risk now is that we have politics of two minorities It may
 be that group on the streets, the group with paramilitary
 nationalist support from the West (including several European
 countries) may feel they ve got the strength to stage a kind of
 coup and this could change the government, it could lead to a
 very violent situation and it could even question whether Ukraine
 is viable as a state RT:And what about Europe s motives? It is based out of
 purely economic reasons, or is it a challenge to Russia? MA:For Ukraine this is part of its economic difficulties 
 There is very little to attract it to Europe In fact, what do
 they produce what European don t already have We have a huge
 agricultural sector, we have a heavy industrial sector and so on 
 It is really a geo strategic issue I think to push Russia further
 and further back into Asia And this is why Ukraine is important Whether it is a good thing for Europe that Ukraine might yet
 become and economically associated with Europe is another
 question If we think about countries like Romania, Poland,
 Bulgaria and Lithuania, we see massive migrations of their
 ordinary people into Western Europe, pushing down wages, making
 social problems that exist in Britain, Germany and France and
 Spain and Italy Ukraine is a big country in an even worse starting point From an
 economic point of view, more association with Europe will
 actually be a stimulus to more economic downturn and more mass
 migration, rather than a starting point for some reform process,
 which will improve life, despite the rhetoric about it RT:Yanukovich said that he may review this early next
 year Do you think perhaps there could be a deal in the
 future? MA:In addition to protesters on the street, there are
 also some economic interests in Ukraine who think they could
 benefit from this I think if we look at the society as a whole
 and the economy as a whole, it s an open question So Yanukovich
 may be trying to calm the situation by saying this He may also
 think that it is to his advantage After all, he faces the
 problem that the most politically organized group, the decisive
 group, may be the pro European lobby who offer very generous
 amounts of financial assistance So he may be hoping to calm
 them In a sense if he doesn t listen to what they say, he should 
 Because essentially they are saying that he is already toast 
 that they protest about Mrs Tymoshenko being in prison, but they
 intend to put him and his supporters in prison This is part of a
 problem of the heightened tensions in Ukraine Once you begin to
 have one group saying that the other side of the equation is
 traitors, enemies of people, the danger is that those people have
 nowhere to go You begin to create the atmosphere of a civil war,
 rather than of a civil debate RT:Brussels was very surprised when Ukraine made a
 U turn over this Are they afraid of losing face over this? MA:Brussels and West in general would prefer to be
 winners out of this and they hope that Mr Yanukovich will shoot
 himself in the other foot, having not handled this crisis very
 well so far, but he will try to curry favor back in Brussels, but
 I don t think this would rescue him Maybe sadly there is nothing
 that can rescue the Ukrainian situation easily or simply The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/protests-in-ukraine-revolution-567/

 many protesters saying they want him to sign that deal with the
 EU He says that will come with economic damage for the country 
 What are his choices now? William Engdhal:First of all I think it s quite right
 about the economic damage with the special association with the
 European Union This was a Washington agenda and has been for
 more than six years The EU is simply acting as a proxy for
 Washington to essentially strip Ukraine from Russia and weaken
 and isolate Russia even more So the geopolitical stakes are huge
 in this The Ukrainian police made a colossal blunder, the same as
 Milosevic made back in Yugoslavia, and the same blunder that
 Bashar Assad made at the onset of the protests in Syria and
 that is to react with state violence, because that is exactly
 what the opposition was hoping and praying for: that they would
 lose their cool and give a red flag for the protesters to come
 out on mass And that s precisely what has happened RT:Surely, isn t there a genuine belief that the EU is
 better for Ukrainians? Otherwise we wouldn t see hundreds of
 thousands of them protesting right now WE:There s a genuine belief in many children in Santa
 Claus, but that doesn t mean Santa Claus exists Quite seriously, the protesters people get on the streets out of
 emotion, not out of reasoned logic in most cases In Tahir Square
 in Egypt the emotion was freedom, democracy and that was
 manipulated by the backers of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi, et
 all, to bring the Brotherhood into power and discard the
 legitimate student democratic protests I suspect that the same networks that created the Orange
 Revolution back in 2003/04 and that is the National Endowment for
 Democracy, Freedom House, various front organizations of the US
 State Department are quite active in this protest and are trying
 to steer it and build it in a very professional guided way 
 Another kind of colorrevolution if you will, mark two for
 Ukraine Hopefully the government starts responding a little bit more
 intelligently The head of the national police has apologized for
 the excessive use of force and violence, but it s going to take
 much more than that RT:And what do you make of the fact that European MPs
 have been seen talking to opposition members here actually in
 Kiev? Is that in effect may be them stirring up trouble and
 perhaps even an attack on the country s sovereignty? Should they
 actually be doing that right now? WE:No, the speaker of the Lithuanian
 parliament among others and she made a blatant intervention in
 the internal affairs of a sovereign state, Ukraine, several days
 ago, hailing European Union membership for Ukraine etc So this
 is major push by the West, by NATO essentially, to create chaos
 in Ukraine and weaken the ties with Russia RT:Where does that put EU Russia ties now because they
 are very important trading partners and they ve got a lot to lose
 here, haven t they? WE:Well they do, and I go back to my initial statement,
 this is not about the EU as EU, this is Washington acting through
 the cat s paw of the European Union, trough political networks in
 Brussels and so forth And Cameron and Hollande s government in
 France; Merkel to a limited extent because the Germans are much
 more sensitive about good relations with Moscow But this is a geopolitical agenda, it s much bigger than Ukraine,
 it s much bigger than tens or hundreds of thousands of protesters
 on the street I think sober heads have to prevail in this situation and
 rationally discuss what s at stake If there was police violence,
 they should be punished for it The population should realize
 Ukraine has a huge problem, I know from Ukrainian friends, with
 state corruption, with business corruption on all levels, they
 should begin addressing that as well But it s not going to
 happen because if the opposition comes back in, they re as
 corrupt as the people in there now It s just different
 left handed corruption versus right handed corruption, I suppose The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/eu-ukraine-washington-proxy-562/

 officers have sought medical help as well On Sunday the administrative court in Kiev complied with a suit
 from the city mayor s office, prohibiting rallies on two major
 city squares until January 7 including Independence Square 
 and three streets in downtown Kiev That means that until
 Orthodox Christmas any kind of demonstration will be illegal and
 suppressed by law enforcement In the first half of the day, police opted to leave the scene of
 persistent demonstrations following accusations that law
 enforcement had used disproportionate force on Saturday while
 dispersing an opposition rally in downtown Kiev As no one had been guarding either the mayor s office or Maidan

 provocateurs who attempted to vandalize the mayor s office by
 breaking the windows A group of young masked people dressed in
 black wearing orange safety helmets was surrounded by opposition

 also condemned the use of force against the demonstrators and
 ordered the prosecutor general to investigate the situation Ukraine s Prosecutor General, Viktor Pshonka, ordered an
 investigation into the lawfulness of the use of impact munitions
 by police and also to verify whether there were provocateurs
 among the protesters People were rallying on Maidan legally This is their
 constitutional right and the task of law enforcement in the first
 place is to ensure realization of that right, ùthe

"29 Nov, 2013",‚ÄòAnother president may sign it‚Äô: EU eyes Ukraine opposition as Kiev rejects trade deal,"Ukraine has rejected a key integration deal with Europe The EU keeps the door open for Kiev, but doubts it would happen under the current government It comes as opposition holds thousands strong protests against the rejection The deal was rejected on Friday in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, where European leaders have gathered Unlike Moldova, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which initialed association agreements with the EU, Ukraine stuck to its decision not to integrate with the union Even after announcing that there would be no deal, Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovich went to the summit to personally explain his government s move He said it would be too painful for Ukrainian economy at present Kiev wants to integrate into the EU, but is not ready to do it at the moment even after four years of preparations [Softening the economic blow] requires our joint work on a program of economic aid to Ukraine, which will allow us to implement the preparation for the signing of the agreement We believe such a program should be the result of a joint effort by Ukraine and the EU, ùYanukovich said on Friday Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency and who was among the most vocal proponents of the Eastern Partnership integration project, didn t take long in dismissing Yanukovich s requests The Ukrainian elite, Ukrainian government could have changed their approach The European Union will not bargain anymore All the main terms [of the agreement] are well known There will be no additional terms, ùshe said The EU still supports the intention of the Ukrainian people to become closer with Europe, but the Ukrainian authorities have to a large extent lost the EU s trust, ùGrybauskaite added In addition to the aid, the Ukrainian president requested that the EU settle its differences with Russia over Ukrainian integration through trilateral talks, a request that Europe has been strongly rejecting We are talking about bilateral agreement between the EU and Ukraine How can we involve a third country in it? We cannot allow a third to have a veto, ùPresident of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso said The scolding remarks are a sign of disappointment with Ukraine s U turn, which the Lithuanian president described as choosing a road to nowhere ùon Tuesday following a meeting between Yanukovich and European leaders Even as the meeting was about to start, EU leaders were not hiding that they have little hope of convincing Yanukovich to reconsider We will make very clear here that the EU is ready to accept Ukraine as an associate member, to sign the association treaty Then we will see We have no hope that it will happen this time, but the door is open, ùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Apparently the door will have to remain open for some time, until there is a new government in Kiev What s very certain is that the president of a country isn t the country, ùEU parliament President Martin Schulz said before the meeting One can agree with Yanukovich or not Maybe another government with another orientation will come to power ù EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy has called the EU s offer the most ambitious ùproposed to a non member Despite Ukraine s decision, Rompuy said, the summit was successful The European Union s position [over Ukraine] remains clear The offer of signing the most ambitious agreement the EU has ever offered to a non member state is still on the table, ùhe said Rompuy stressed that the EU is ready to resume negotiations with Ukraine at any moment ù The next presidential election in Ukraine is to be held in 2015, but the country s recent history saw a vivid example of how a government can collapse under a pressure from the streets The same Yanukovich was called the winner of the 2004 elections, but was forced out by the crowds supporting his main competitor The past experience of the orangerevolution lingers over Ukraine now, as tens of thousands of people gather in the streets to protest against the government Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Kiev to protest both for and against Yanukovich Pro EU integration protesters, many of whom are students, have linked hands to form a human chain Organizers said the chain ùshould link Ukrainian cities and eventually reach the Polish border as a symbol of unity with the EU The ambitious feat would require some 522,000 people, according to the organizers initial estimate, a figure which skeptics say they have no hope of mustering Anti government protesters also called on Washington to pressure their government Anonline petitionon the White House website asking the US to issue travel ban on top Ukraine government officials unless Yanukovich signs the deal with the EU has gathered over 75,000 signatures The mass demonstrations, which started last week after the government first announced the decision, have been mostly peaceful But on several occasions groups of aggressive activists armed with pepper sprayclashedwith Ukrainian riot police There were also some calls on the internet for a takeover of government buildings, which prompted police to warn the protesters against such moves Kiev s main argument against the trade agreement was that it would cost too much While the $830 million figure thatYanukovich voiceddrew some skeptical comments from the Europeans, EU officials admit that without the union s help Kiev would find it hard to adapt to greater openness of its market But Europe is not in the best economic shape and is not prepared to shoulder Ukraine as much as it would like it to Ordinary Europeans are very uncomfortable with the idea of Ukraine coming to the EU The EU right now is bankrupt with the crisis in the PIGS countries Portugal, Italy, Greece and so forth ùgeopolitical analyst William Engdahl told RT They don t have money to do anything positive for Ukraine The only thing they can do is to try to take advantage of the weakness of Ukraine ù One of the reasons why Ukraine s integration with the EU would cost so much is that the move would leave it barred from its traditional Russian markets Moscow warned that it would not keep export preferences with Ukraine after it signs free trade agreements with EU, because it would effectively open the Russian market to European goods EU officials are branding Russia s position as harsh economic pressure and say it was due to that pressure that Kiev rejected the trade deal Moscow accuses Brussels of politicizing a purely economic issue and says the Europeans are the onespressuring Ukraineinto signing an unfavorable deal The head of Russia s State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, Aleksey Pushkov, has predicted that the EU will not support Yanukovich in the next presidential elections, saying the Union now counts on ù the opposition The signal is clear: on the threshold of Ukraine s 2015 elections the EU counts on the opposition and is already preparing a replacement for Yanukovich Expect new Maidans [referring to protests at Kiev s Independence Square

"28 Nov, 2013","EU-Ukraine: Cultural divide, US ambitions and Brussels expansionism","Whether or not Ukrainian entry to the EU is financially viable, it s obvious that Brussels is trying to interfere in all sorts of spheres , certainly in Russia s sphere Experts who talked to RT
 looked at the key issues surrounding Ukraine s debate over entry
 into the EU, with the main focus on the political level and the
 direction the country will choose to take amid concerns of
 economic instability in the EU Many have argued that Ukrainian entry to the EU will be too
 expensive for Europe But, the founder of the Europolis think
 tank, Dr Markus Kerber, told RT he believes that the financial
 aspects of the deal are not even on the agenda yet Financial
 recommendations are certainly an important argument, but for the
 time being what matters most is that the Ukrainian population is
 split between those who have a preference for Russia and those
 who have a preference for the EU, ùKerber stated He argues that it takes years to negotiate the right conditions
 for a country s entry, even after it registers its application The decision to enter in such a process does not necessarily
 mean that the day after the country becomes a member, so for the
 time being and for the not too distant future there is no
 financial burden for the EU, ùKerber said Nobody can quantify [the cost of Ukraine s entry into the EU]
 because before such an entry becomes effective you have years of
 negotiation, years of adaptation and adjustment process Take a
 look at the Mediterranean countries such as Portugal and Spain 
 It took years to negotiate the entry and it took years to find
 the final form in order to enter the EU, ùhe added Independence Party MEP, Paul Nuttall, argues that Brussels is an
 expansionist machine that wants to include Ukraine along with
 many other countries, putting the burden on already existing
 members who are struggling to pull the weight Nuttall pointed out that 12 percent of people across Europe
 are unemployed, 25 percent of 18 24 are also unemployed ù,yet the EU wants Ukraine to eventually join, they want Albania
 and Serbia to join, they even want Turkey to join This is an
 expansionist organization, it wants more countries and they want
 Ukraine to be part of that European Union, ùhe told RT The expansion of this organization knows no ends Brussels is
 trying to interfere in all sorts of spheres, certainly in
 Russia s sphere, it wants to expand the EU, ùNuttall added While some believe it is purely an EU matter, author and
 geopolitical analyst, William Engdahl, believes that any kind of
 manipulation in the process on behalf of the EU is orchestrated
 by the US, which has been the driver for the Ukrainian EU
 partnership from the beginning They tried to bring Ukraine into NATO with the Orange
 Revolution, which they incited back in 2003 04 and now they are
 trying it through the economic side of things And the goal is to
 isolate Russia and make it as weak as possible as a global
 player, ùEngdahl told RT He added the EU is not actually united on the issue at all They [EU] are very uncomfortable with the idea of Ukraine
 coming into the EU The EU right now is bankrupt with the crisis
 in the PIGS countries They don t have money to do anything with

 an association agreement with the EU, taken days before a
 largely anticipated deal was due to be made at the Eastern
 Partnership summit in Vilnius, has sparked angry protests in Kiev
 and other major Ukrainian cities The ex Soviet republic, located in the very heart of Eastern
 Europe with a territory larger than France, the land of the
 well known writer Nikolay Gogol, famous gorilka, rare beauties
 and hundreds of miles of rich black soil is currently locked in a
 fresh outbreak of identity crisis ù This is a new attempt to do some more mental exercise and more
 soul searching to decide once and for all where to head: to the
 East or to the West This is a question that has already split Ukrainians many times
 in their country s turbulent history both in the pre and
 post independence period Ukraina tse Europa! ù ( Ukraine is Europe! ù) chants an
 agitated crowd at Kiev Independence square It is energized by a
 two meter, stone faced giant, raising his granite fist high in
 the air: the famous world heavyweight boxing champion and the
 leader of UDAR ( Blow ), the Ukrainian opposition party,
 Vitaly Klitchko Fluent in German, English and other European languages, Vitaly
 Klitchko has already developed a reputation forcelebrity in
 Hamburg his adopted native town Probably, he has every right
 to boast of his European identity ù But how appropriate
 would it be to call Europeans ùthose ordinary Ukrainians,
 who are braving cold rain, police batons and tear gas on
 Independence square? † How long will it take to make regular
 Europeans out of weary Ukrainian babushkas and ordinary folks who
 often live in huts with constant power cuts and no central
 heating, and have hardly seen a euro in their life? If Ukraine one day becomes Europe it will happen not today or
 tomorrow However, for the people on Kiev s main square the
 question of their country making a European choice sounds like now or never ù For them this is a do or die exercise and
 they show no inclination for compromise and backtracking They
 are determined to put more pressure on President Yanukovich to
 force him to reconsider his decision not to miss the Eastern
 Partnership train, departing from Vilnius station this Friday Those who are looking not to the East but to the West, fail to
 understand, that the European Union approached Vilnius summit
 empty handed, offering Ukraine nothing in return, except its own
 mantras about a happy family of nations ù, living in a Pan European home ù No subsidies for the restructuring of the Ukrainian economy, no
 visa free regime, and not even the slightest hint that one day
 Ukraine might be privileged enough to get the key to its own flat
 in the EU home So, it is not predatory Russia ù, which has browbeaten
 President Yanukovich and forced him to turn down the EU proposal 
 Self sufficient European bureaucracy has no one to blame but
 itself One may say that Europe itself is preoccupied with its own
 problems, and therefore at this juncture it has little to offer
 the new recruits from the Eastern Partnership (Ukraine, Moldova,
 Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus) But if the moment for
 the Eastern Partnership summit was untimely, then what was the
 rush to sign an association agreement with Ukraine? However, European bureaucracy doesn t seem to display the sense
 of reality and flexibility needed to resolve the Ukrainian issue,
 which is turning into another bone of contention between Moscow
 and Brussels † President Yanukovich s government proposal to
 hold trilateral talks with Russia and the EU got a frosty
 response with Lithuania s foreign minister, who said we do
 not see a role for any third country in this process ù The second myth of the new Ukrainian statehood is the idea that
 as the EU is a gate to paradise, so Russia is a door to hell for
 Ukraine There should be no integration with the land of
 Putin ùand let s forget about geographical proximity and
 myriads of trade, economic, social and cultural ties between the
 two nations The escalating political crisis in Ukraine which has reminded
 people of the events of the orangerevolution in 2004 coincided
 with the 80th anniversary of Holodomor a man made famine that
 claimed the lives of millions Meantime, it was not only tens of
 thousands of Ukrainians who died of hunger in the pre war
 Stalinist Soviet empire The area created by this unprecedented
 humanitarian catastrophe spread far beyond the borders of modern
 Ukraine to the basin of the Volga River and further eastward However, the ideologists behind Ukraine s new European identity
 insist that it was a deliberate and targeted policy of genocide
 against the Ukrainian nation, which was orchestrated by the
 Kremlin So, looking through the prism of this myth, Russia is
 seen as an alien, hostile power Respectively, key integration
 projects with Russia, like the Customs Union or the Eurasian
 Union are described as detrimental to Ukrainian national
 interests By adopting the new European myth, a large part of Ukrainian
 society shows it remains deeply Soviet in its mentality While
 Soviet people naively believed in a happy family of nations and
 communism s paradise, two decades after the collapse of the
 Soviet Union many Ukrainians have the same kind of belief in a
 new European paradise and the European happy family of
 nations ùthat they must enter at any cost Not many are willing to admit that there is no such thing as
 paradise, and the cost of pursuing such myths for Ukraine s new
 statehood might be quite high The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-protests-eu-russia-323/

 more economic opportunity in Europe, and hopes to act as a
 bridge between Russia and the EU, President Viktor Yanukovich,

 up efforts against Yanukovich, who faces reelection in 15 months If there is no deal in Nov 2013, Putin will have won a
 resounding psychological victory most everyone in the EU would
 want to prevent that, and Yanukovych counts on it, ùTrenin
 said Russia has set sights on the 2015 elections in Ukraine and
 intends to help a pro Russian leader to power Ironically,
 however, the more pressure Russia applies on Ukraine, the less
 likely it will succeed Even more ironically, this will be in
 Russia s own best interest the last thing it should want is
 Ukraine in the Customs Union, ùTrenin said The EU and the International Monetary Fund will likely need to
 finance a $12 billion loan to Ukraine, according to a May 2013
 estimate by The Goldman Sachs Group In Ukraine, bonds have hit fresh lows, currency reserves are
 almost nonexistent, and there s more than $60 billion in debt,
 roughly a third of the country s GDP, due by July 2014, according
 to central bank data from July 2013 The EU trade deal may not be able to prevent the grivnya,
 Ukraine s currency, from going bust before elections, which could
 open up political capital for Russia If Yanukovich doesn t grant former Prime Minister Julia
 Tymoshenko a pardon by November 18, European ministers may delay
 Ukraine s ratification until 2014 The refusal to release and free Tymoshenko threatens to
 disrupt the signing of the agreement, ùPolish Foreign
 Minister Radoslaw SIkorski was quoted saying on the Polish
 television program, Polsat News on Oct 31 He urged the
 Ukrainians not to waste time with Tymoshenko s release Tymoshenko was jailed for a gas deal she brokered with Russia in
 2009 Her imprisonment is seen by European ministers as political
 persecution She was also charged with murder, an accusation that
 was later dropped Her release would be symbolic and show that Ukraine is ready to
 jettison corruption, hold fair elections, and most importantly
 for EU ministers, end selective justice Tymoshenko, 52, has requested she be allowed to travel to Germany
 to receive medical treatment for spinal problems Yanukovich has
 dismissed the idea of a pardon, but said he will sign any draft
 law that lets her take a prison break to receive medical
 treatment abroad The bill is still in the in the preliminary stages but if it
 is enacted, it will be seen positively by the EU and have
 significant influence for Ukraine s acceptance It s a temporary
 alternative for an amnesty act, ùAleksey Zorin, an attorney

 Eurasian block with promises of lower gas prices and other trade
 perks Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan met in Minsk on October 24 to

 and economic alliance which will incorporate other Commonwealth
 of Independent States (CIS) like Armenia, Tajikistan, and
 Kyrgyzstan 50 percent of Ukranians, 57 percent of Armenians, and 59 percent

 Eurasian Development Bank survey published on September 24, 2013 Membership in the EAU entails uniting economies, legal systems,

 order for the ambitious plan to work, Russia needs to lure
 strategically important nations like Ukraine into the trade
 circle Other Soviet satellite states have chosen to instead hang their
 hat with Europe Poland, Ukraine s co host for the 2012 EuroCup, entered the EU in
 2004, and like Ukraine, was seen as a swing state, as their
 membership wasn t a sure thing Romania and Bulgaria have been EU
 members since 2007, and Croatia joined this year Armenia, Poland, Moldova, and Azerbaijan will join Ukraine at the

 decision of joining Russia s trade bloc, which the EU sees as
 incompatible and grounds of rejection for EU membership Armenia said it wouldjoinRussia in the Customs Union, as well as engage
 in the Eurasian integration process, instead of negotiating a
 free trade agreement Ukraine s ascension to EU membership could be another 15 20 years
 down the road, and might be derailed by a number of factors a
 pro Russia president taking power in 2015 or even discord from
 within the EU, as some ministers doubt expansion is a sound
 strategy during economic recession Turkey s progress towards EU membership has been at a stand still
 since it first applied in 1987 and still hasn t made much headway
 even after signing a free trade agreement with the EU in 1995 
 Turkey is now considering joining the Customs Union If Ukraine s ratification follows a similar trajectory, Ukraine s
 Russian leaning crowd, centered mostly in Kiev, Crimea, and
 eastern Ukraine, could make a case for going back to its historic
 trade partner Russia told Ukraine it could save $10 billion in gas discounts if
 it joins the Customs Union, but Ukraine wants to rid itself of
 its dependence on Russian energy Gazprom and Kiev s Naftogas have a rocky payment and pricing
 history, and most recently, Gazprom demanded Ukraine urgently pay
 a $1 billion overdue gas bill Ukraine has an extensive non payment credit history for
 Russian gas, mounting debt, and restructuring, ùAleksey
 Grivach, deputy director of Gas Projects at Russia s National
 Energy Security Fund, told RT in an email Friday The situation is itself dangerous Ukraine is poorly
 prepared for the winter season, ùGrivach told RT Earlier in October Naftogaz said it had 17 billion cubic meters
 of gas stored up, which they believe will be enough to heat
 Ukraine through the winter The gas debt payment request is not connected to Ukraine s
 possible associated membership with the EU, Putin s press
 secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday Russia and Ukraine waged two gas wars over prices in the winters
 of 2006 and 2009 (which lasted 3 weeks) over a similar claim
 Ukraine was late on a payment If another gas war erupts over the current pricing tiff and
 Russia turns off the gas, EU officials said they will help with
 supplies to Ukraine This strategy would burden neighboring European states, as a
 supply crunch would bump up prices It is also only palpable for
 a few weeks Under the leadership of Tymoshenko, the Ukrainian gas company
 signed a 2009 pre pay contract with Gazprom Yanukovich, who
 has complained about the unfair prices, has scaled down Gazprom
 imports 40 percent year on year, and is instead seeking other
 energy suppliers After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became a natural
 hub for transporting Russian gas to European and Turkish markets,
 but Gazprom, Russia s state owned gas giant, is building a maze
 of new pipelines tocircumventtheir western neighbor in transit

 deal?William Engdahl:First of all the shale gas option is a very
 overplayed bubble by Wall Street The gas depletes so rapidly, if
 you take the example of shale gas in the US, the same companies
 have now moved into shale oil because the cost of extracting gas
 and drilling evermore wells is just prohibitive, to say nothing
 of the environmental impact of that on the ground water tables
 with the injection of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals and
 also the question of water usage I do not think that shale gas
 is at all, and certainly not from Exxon, Shell or Chevron, to
 turn from Russian gas companies for conventional gas to develop
 unknown quantity of shale gas and have it deplete within a matter
 of less than 10 years is really going to be a dead end for
 Ukraine RT:President Yanukovych is actively lobbying for
 creation of a free trade zone between Ukraine and the EU,
 claiming it would boost Europe s markets by seven percent What
 do you make of the forecasts?WE:President Yanukovych is living in a dream world I
 think this is a huge geopolitical blunder by him and by his
 government to go for this EU Free Trade Area First of all, the
 EU is in the throes of a deep, deep, recession It is by no means
 out of the woods on that front Countries like Spain, Portugal,
 Greece of course and other countries are in a deep recession The
 EU has very little to offer to Ukraine, except more unemployment,
 if you will, kind of a shock therapy MAK 2 that would come with
 the trade agreement conditions as they stand now Ukraine itself,
 excuse me, but it is one of the most corrupt countries by all
 accounts from Ukrainians that I know, businessmen and others RT:So Ukraine is not getting anything out of this
 partnership?WE:Absolutely not RT:Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said a partnership
 with the EU will most likely eliminate Ukraine s participation in
 the Customs Union What effect might that have on Kiev?WE:It would be a severe blow to the Ukrainian economy I
 think the comments of the new US ambassador to Kiev are
 indicative This has been a Washington geo political strategy
 since 2003 2004, with the orangerevolution which was a NATO US
 ploy to pull Ukraine out of the orbit of the Central Asia/Russia
 and bring it into that orbit of NATO so that Russia is more and
 more surrounded by the hostile powers on its borders This is an
 extremely foolish thing for Ukraine to be doing right now 
 Perhaps Moscow has made too many blunders in playing hard ball
 with Ukraine, that I can t judge Ukraine s future is not with
 the EU They have illusions if they think IMF loans are going to
 bail them out of any economic troubles and the Western investors
 are going to come in there and just cherry pick what they want
 and just leave Ukraine poor † and with higher unemployment

"30 Jul, 2013",Pro-gun activist Kokesh re-arrested in Washington DC after being released from Virginia jail,"A judge at the DC Superior Court has ordered gun rights activist Adam Kokesh to be held without bond until his next court appearance, calling him a very dangerous man ù Kokesh was rearrested in the District after he was freed on bond
 last week in Virginia During a preliminary hearing on
 Monday, the DC judge decided to hold the activist without
 bond, calling him a dangerous man and a flight risk Kokesh is
 expected back in the court on Aug 13 to stand trial
 on gun charges The 31 year old former Marine from Herndon, Va , was charged with
 one count of openly carrying a weapon in violation of the
 District of Columbia s firearms law According to court
 documents, Kokesh went to Freedom Plaza on July 4 and loaded four
 rounds of ammunition into a shotgun He then posted a YouTube
 video in which he taunts the District s strict gun laws, while
 holding his shotgun in downtown DC, just blocks away from the
 White House We will not be silent We will not obey We will not allow
 our government to destroy our humanity, ùhe says in the
 video We are the final American revolution See you next
 Independence Day ù Kokesh hoped that hundreds of thousands of Americans would march
 from Virginia into DC, carrying firearms in defiance of the
 city s ban on loaded guns The march was cancelled, but Kokesh
 still appeared in DC with his shotgun, posting a video with a
 synopsis that reads, Can you count the felonies committed in
 this video? No, you can t possibly count them all ù In the nation s capital, carrying a gun outside of a home or
 place of business carries a maximum penalty of five years in
 prison and a fine of $5,000 But Kokesh is also facing a number
 of other charges: after US Park Police obtained a warrant to
 search the Virginia man s home, they found hallucinogenic
 mushrooms in the raid Kokesh waschargedwith possession of a Schedule I or Schedule II drug on July 9 
 Police also confiscated 10 guns that they found in the raid,
 including a Maverick Arms 12 gauge pump action shotgun that
 resembles the weapon shown in the YouTube clip Kokesh was initially arrested on drug charges and held in a
 Fairfax jail until late last week, after supporters raised the
 $5,000 they needed to post bond But the gun rights activists was
 quickly rearrested by the District, where he will stand trial for
 violating the city s firearms law On Monday, Defense Attorney Peter Cooper said that
 US Park Police could not prove that the YouTube video was real or
 that the ammunition raided from Kokesh s home was the same that
 was used to load the gun in the video Cooper told the court that
 the stunt was nothing more than political theater ù He
 also noted that his client lived with eight roommates and there
 was no evidence proving that the recovered firearms belonged to
 Kokesh But DC Judge Frederick Sullivan refused to grant Kokesh bond,
 arguing that he posed a flight risk and ordering him to be held
 until the trial begins I consider your client to be a very dangerous man, ùthe
 judge said This is not a political statement ù Kokesh, who was wearing an orange jumpsuit as he sat beside his
 attorney during the preliminary hearing, will spend the next two
 weeks in his jail cell in anticipation of his Aug 
 13 trial date ",https://www.rt.com/usa/adfam-kokesh-arrested-gun-811/
"27 Jul, 2013","1,025 years of Christianity: Ukraine hosts Orthodox celebrations while questioning its future","The Orthodox Church is celebrating the 1025th anniversary of introduction of Christianity into medieval Russia Clerical delegations and the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are joining the festivities in Ukraine s capital, Kiev The culmination of the celebrations will be a liturgy in Kiev s
 central cathedral Kiev Pechersk Laura (Kiev Monastery of the
 Caves) and a sacred procession carrying the St Andrew s cross, a
 symbolic relic that once united the nations on the territory of
 modern Belarus, Ukraine and European part of Russian Federation
 over a millennium ago, when Kiev was the main center of the
 Eastern Slavic world Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ, is believed to
 be the one who brought Christianity to Eastern Europe Legends
 insist he sailed across the Black Sea and landed in the Greek
 colony of Chersonesus Taurica in Crimea, modern Ukraine Then he
 traveled north along the Dnieper River, passing the place where
 the City of Kiev was founded in the 5th century and allegedly
 reaching the area not far from the Baltic Sea, where the Russian
 city of Veliky Novgorod was founded in the 9th century On his
 legendary journey, mentioned in the Russian Primary Chronicle,
 Saint Andrew baptized thousands to new faith Nine centuries later, in 988 AD, Prince Vladimir, who ruled in
 Kiev, one of major cities in the Eastern Slavs land of Rus,
 introduced Christianity in his lands, † and was baptized
 together with his troops and subjects Rus over centuries grew
 into the Russian Empire, the USSR and after its collapse the
 cradle of Orthodox Christianity now lies outside geographical
 Russia Together with clerical delegations, many political leaders are
 paying visits to the celebrations One of the issues dominating the agenda is the choice Ukraine is
 still to make between integrating with the EU or joining the
 Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan to form a
 Eurasian Union in the near future This day marks the unity of our peoples, ùRussian
 President Vladimir Putin told Ukrainian President Viktor
 Yanukovich We have several common questions we will be able
 to discuss during these days of celebrations There will be
 another meeting tomorrow where we will talk security ù Relations between Moscow and Kiev since the fall of the Soviet
 Union have witnessed many changes Over the last 20 years,
 Ukraine has endured an orangerevolution and several gas
 conflicts with Russia, yet strong economic and historical ties
 seem to be prevailing over the divide Many also fear that Ukraine if choosing to part with Russia in
 search for a better future with the EU might lose not only its
 independence to Brussels, but also its national identity Ukraine is destined to strive for favorable relations with
 Russia for thousands of reasons, ùMikhail Pogrebinsky from
 the Center for Political and Conflict Studies in Kiev told RT Over half of the Ukrainian population considers Russian to be
 their native language and would like to see their country
 maintain good relations with the neighbor Moreover, Orthodox
 Christianity remains a cementing force that kept Russians and
 Ukrainians inhabiting the territory between Baltic and Black seas
 together for over 1,000 years It is enough to say that every third Ukrainian has close
 relatives within Russia, ùsays Pogrebinsky But Ukraine s elite is moving in the opposite direction to
 associate Ukraine with the EU, pretending they do not hear the
 voices of the citizens protesting against solely European
 orientation, Pogrebinsky said Moscow wants to see its neighbor playing a more active role in
 the regional cooperation, becoming an integral player of the
 Customs Union The Ukrainian economy remains highly dependent on
 Russia, the major market for Ukrainian goods, and also because
 over 700,000 Ukrainians are working in Russian Federation,
 according to official statistics ",https://www.rt.com/news/russia-ukraine-christianity-celebrations-670/
"10 Apr, 2013",Election watchdog rejects ‚Äòforeign agent‚Äô status,"The GOLOS Association has denied accusations put forward by the Justice Ministry that it receives funding from abroad and engages in political work, activities that would force the NGO to conform to Russia s new foreign agent law The Justice Ministry has opened a case against the non profit
organization GOLOS over its failure to register as a foreign
agent operating in the territory of the Russian Federation The
Ministry said it would submit an affidavit against GOLOS on
Wednesday The (GOLOS) association receives funding from foreign
sources, according to information acquired by the Federal
Fiscal Monitoring Service At the same time, the association
engages in political activity on Russian territory in
violation of Russian law, a statement on the ministry s website
announced Also, the Justice Ministry said the cash award that GOLOS
received for winning the Sakharov Prize named in honor of the
Russian physicist Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov (1921 1989) awarded
by Norwegian rights activists represents another incident of
foreign funding However, GOLOS said it had returned the money and would defend
itself in court We ll file an appeal with the court, because GOLOS does not
engage in politics, ùthe NGO s deputy executive director
Grigory Melkonyats told reporters on Tuesday Furthermore, it
has not received funding from foreign sources since the foreign
agents law on non profit organizations went into effect ù The foreign agents bill was signed into law by President Putin
in July 2012 Melkonyats said the Justice Ministry s document mentions funds
received in 2008, but, according to the agency s head, the law is
not retroactive ù If found guilty of violating the foreign agents law, GOLOS
officials may face a 100,000 ($3,200) to 300,000 ($9,600) rouble
fine In the past, GOLOS had received much of its funding from the
United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, which
had operated in Russia for two decades That lengthy stay came to
an abrupt end in September last year when the Kremlin decided the
agency had overstayed its welcome Then, explaining the move, Dmitry Peskov, President Putin s
press secretary, said that the American aid agency was interfering
in Russia s political process The decision to end USAID s activities in Russia came just
months after the introduction of the foreign agents law, which
forces non profit organizations receiving funding from abroad and
engaging in political activity to register with the Justice
Ministry as foreign agents ù Nongovernmental organizations are now required to file a
financial report to officials every quarter The law instructs the Justice Ministry to prepare annual reports
on nongovernmental agencies deemed as foreign agents and present it
to the Lower House, including a full breakdown of their
finances In early April, the Ministry reported that last year it had
requested the closure and suspension of about 9,000 nongovernmental
organizations over various violations of the law Of that number,
21 have been suspended Meanwhile, as the debate over how to regulate foreign supported
NGOs rages, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, firebrand leader of the Russian
Liberal Democratic Party, has called for shutting down every
non governmental organization (NGO) connected to foreigners, saying
their goal is to instigate orangerevolution s and provocations in
Russia We should close down every organization linked to abroad;

In May, however, the atmosphere changed On the eve of Putin s inauguration over 400 people were detained in Bolotnaya Square after clashes broke out between protesters and police Twenty police officers and almost as many demonstrators were injured Twelve people remain under arrest since the May 6 incident on charges of riot instigation On Friday, prosecutors said the investigation was over and soon the cases will be handed over to the court A thirteenth person has already been sentenced to 4 5 years in jail for brutally attacking five police officers In the wake of the violence, MPs have also passed a bill which bans unsanctioned demonstrations and pens fines for order violations at up to 20,000 rubles ($650) or even to 300,000 ($9,800) if protesters damage state or private property But in other initiatives direct elections of regional governors were reintroduced Since 2006, the governors had been appointed by the president With all the activity and recent election to the Opposition Coordination Council, political analysts note the opposition has lost its steam Many argue the movement still needs to create a viable platform that reaches all Russians, as well as put forward unified leaders Pussy Riot in jail In the final leg of the presidential race, a feminist punk group called Pussy Riot staged a performance in Moscow s central Cathedral, Christ the Savior Three members of the group were arrested and placed in custody after attempting to sing a mock prayer Virgin Mary, Drive Putin Away ùOn August 18, a Moscow court sentenced Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Ekaterina Samutsevich to two years in a medium security prison for hooliganism motivated by religious hatred and enmity Two months later Samutsevich was released on probation, while the two others made their way to the assigned jail Controversy surrounded the case from the very beginning as Pussy Riot s supporters, inside and outside Russia, viewed their act as purely political, while many Orthodox believers considered the prank an outright insult to their religion However, in the wake of the jail sentence handed down, many officials said it was over the top especially considering the time the three girls spent in custody, before and during the trial I think that they know already what it is like in prison, Prime Minister Dmitry Medveded said in November, The state has already demonstrated to them its punitive possibilities, and explained to them that they must behave properly from the legal and moral points of view ùAfter the sentence was announced, the Russian Orthodox Church asked for mercy on the Pussy Riot members Later, however it called for protection from blasphemy To that, MPs proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for insults to religious feelings The bill, submitted to the Lower House in September, provides up to five years in prison and fines of up to 300,000 rubles (under $10,000) for offenders Foreign agents bill and US

sponsored from abroad and involved in political activities Starting with November, such organizations are subject to yearly audits In the press, every comment by such a group should be accompanied by the foreign agent ù status Groups refusing to register as foreign agents will be fined and might be banned MPs said the bill falls in line with international practice and in general makes foreign countries activities in Russia more transparent Many NGOs, including the Moscow Helsinki Group and Transparency International, said they would boycott the new law since they do not wish to acquire a foreign agent status They could give up donations from abroad if the court makes them, but for most of them it would mean closing offices altogether, since Russian officials and businesses are reluctant to sponsor such organizations December brought another much disputed piece of legislation an official ban on US citizens adopting Russian children, which was passed by the parliament as a counter measure to Washington s Magnitsky List Sponsors of the law justify it with at least 19 cases of abuse of Russian children by their American adoptive families They complained that the punishment for the offences issued by the US justice system was disproportionately mild, while Russian diplomats were prevented from giving enough input in the prosecution of such cases Critics of the bill said it imperils the foster children, including those with special needs, who will now be barred from living a happy life in American families They say the Russian authorities have made those kids victims of a political row between Moscow and Washington Opposition to the law came from some cabinet ministers and other top Russian officials, among others Moreover, the tit for tat attitude to US Russian relations has made political analysts worry that the two countries might be turning away from their reset ù and could soon plunge into renewed tensions

"9 Feb, 2012",Comparing Oranges‚Ä¶,"Pro Kremlin politicians and pundits explain the recent mass protests as an orangerevolution ù conspiracy orchestrated by the West Member of the Russian Public Chamber Nikolay Svanidze believes the allegations are a hoax to demonize the opposition In the article below, historian and analyst Nikolay Svanidze explains his view One of the wings of Russia s political spectrum appears to be constantly dominated by hysteria, blaming every instance of public discontent on machinations by the US Department of State A number of parties and politicians are back to the habit of spotting American spy games behind everything This has become the favorite and most commonly employed argument for those backing the Putin government, culminating in a pro Putin rally at the Poklonnaya Hill memorial park on February 4, where speechmakers were getting out of breath stigmatizing the Orange plague ù Sadly, the government itself eagerly relies on this type of supporters Vladimir Putin, for one, has publicly endorsed the Poklonnaya Hill rally Many pro government pundits and observers have rushed to announce a change of tide, ù claiming that pro government rallies are attracting several times more people than opposition protests However, that is an acute case of wishful thinking It is common notion in Russia that official appraisals of rallies strength are notoriously biased, overstating the turnout at pro government events and downplaying protest attendance numbers several times over In fact, the word opposition ù is not really legitimate in this context, as the rallies that attracted tens of thousands of people in Moscow and other cities last December and last week were mainly attended by regular citizens who feel that the existing system of governance deprives them of their civil and political rights It was after Prime Minister Putin denounced the protests and their participants using his rather characteristic choice of derogatory speech that the protest movement indeed turned oppositional Whereas the initial December protests merely demanded that Head of the Central Election Commission Vladimir Churov should resign on account of election fraud, Putin s explicit contempt for the discontented made him the prime target of public scorn As for the two simultaneous and directly antagonistic rallies that took place in Moscow on 4 February 2012, they are hardly comparable While both events were attended by upwards of 100,000 people each, there was a striking difference as regards content While the opposition protest that re assembled at Bolotnaya Square on February 4 had its clearly defined messages and demands, the pro government rally at Poklonnaya Hill had but one purpose: to stick it ù to the Bolotnaya crowd The Poklonnaya meeting was merely a reaction to the Bolotnaya protests, its speakers and slogans being evidently focused on pinning an orangerevolution ù accusation on the protest movement Another thing that revealed how these two events were a world apart was organization Those at Bolotnaya Square came by their own free will, every activist and organizer being a volunteer Of the thousands who made up the crowd at Poklonnaya Hill, the majority were either paid to show up or intimidated into participation by their employers or other authorities I would not rule out that there were also people who came to the memorial park out of their sincere confidence in Vladimir Putin, but numerous reports and revelations show that the rally owed its formidable numbers to administrative mobilization and none of the official rebuttals have so far effectively proved the opposite I have to give credit to the Kremlin s own political consultants, though: staging street action to juxtapose it to an opposition rally was tactically a smart idea However, strategically it is a terribly hazardous gamble, for you effectively pit one part of the populace against another Presenting political opposition as a bunch of unpatriotic upper middle class rascals who deserve to be stomped upon by the good common folk is not only dirty, but also suicidal In whipping up hysteria over a fictional revolution, you risk instigating a very real civil war In a highly stratified and diverse society such as Russia, the Kremlin s current divide and conquer tactics may turn out to be a Pandora s Box But back to the notorious orangerevolution ù speculation Fingering the world s biggest and most ambitious power as the mastermind behind all things evil has repeatedly proved a highly efficient argument among a certain share of Russian society used to the Cold War era reality of the United States being our country s principal adversary Not to mention the perennial trick of finding a foreign enemy to blame for domestic policy failures But let us take a sober look at the global chess board Is Russia challenging the US to global supremacy? Have we been gearing up for war with America? Do they have a reason to perceive us as a threat to be neutralized? If not, then why on Earth would the Americans, tied up as they are with an unwinnable war, a severe economic downturn and social unrest at home, commit so much effort to overthrowing a Russian leader whose trumpeted opposition ù to them has been little more than rhetoric? A popular argument in favor of the Orange conspiracy ù theory is the Ukrainian experience While American influence is admittedly presumed behind the Kiev street protests that propelled a pro Western government into power in 2004, the political situation in today s Russia is only superficially comparable to that in Ukraine seven years back, while its is crucially different in essence In similarity to several post Soviet states, there is a powerful anti Russian sentiment in Ukraine that can be played as a mighty trump card by anyone who wants to rally support for their agenda or political ambition which is exactly what the Ukrainian liberal opposition did In Russia s case, it is not the opposition stirring enmity against a fictional foreign nemesis to impress the public, is it? Secondly, whereas both Ukraine and Georgia had distinct liberal posterboy politicians who enjoyed wide popularity as well as good standing with Western embassies, there is presently NOT A SINGLE liberal politician in Russia who could boast any significant public support Each and every liberal politician in this country is notoriously mistrusted and scorned, and even the recent multi thousand strong street protests explicitly positioned themselves as a no leader movement Should the White House indeed entertain a notion of spinning a prot√©g√© into presidency in Russia, which personality could they possibly spin?Finally, the liberals in the United States might indeed be happy with the prospect of having a more like minded, liberal administration in Moscow to deal with But what are the odds of such a liberal democratic government seizing and keeping power through a revolution in a country like Russia? Meanwhile, the prospect of raging chaos and a civil war in a country armed with nuclear missiles If you think the Americans want us to have a revolution, you must be seriously underestimating their wit for self preservation Nikolay Svanidze, special to RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/orange-revolution-mcfaul-bolotnaya-881/
"7 Feb, 2012",McFaul and the Moscow opposition rallies,"The February 4 rally to support PM Vladimir Putin officially drew four times as many people as the opposition rally Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes that was the first failure of US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view Michael McFaul first visited Russia during Perestroika Later, in the early 1990s, McFaul headed the Moscow office of the National Endowment for Democracy, the main financing hub of the Russian liberal opposition McFaul, therefore, has known Russian liberal grant receivers for quite a long time McFaul, an employee of both the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Stanford s Hoover Institution, then went on to take part in collective theory building behind the British American project to democratize Ukraine and summarize the experience of destabilizing the country He was among the editors of the 2006 book Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine s Democratic Breakthrough ù After the success in Ukraine, the British lobby in the US (Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton) ordered McFaul to turn to Russia, looking for people who behaved similarly to Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko Ultimately, he found Aleksey Navalny and Maria Gaidar (the daughter of Yegor Gaidar, the father ù of Russian liberal reforms of the early 1990s) Aleksey Navalny, a shy young man with a bit of a personality split, was no celebrity in 2006 However, by 2011 he became Russia s most popular blogger and a charismatic public activist Where did this unstable young man, suffering from a Napoleonic complex, find the money to finance his movement? Well, McFaul is a professional He never fails to pick the right people In 2006, the project Da! ù initiated by Navalny and Gaidar, started receiving donations from the National Endowment for Democracy (McFaul is still on the NED s board of directors) As part of the program to initiate an orange coup ù in Russia, McFaul sent Navalny to study at the Yale University as part of the Yale World Fellows program in 2010 After a thorough comparison of the psychoanalytical portrait (apparently, for reflexive governance purposes) of a Russian Viktor Yushchenko, huge foreign grants were opened Therefore, the author of the Aleksey Navalny project is none other than Michael McFaul Maria Gaidar has temporarily fell out of the race (went to study in the United States) after a major scandal in Kirov surrounding her name (Maria Gaidar was allegedly involved in a car crash causing the death of a 13 year old girl) Immediately after his arrival in Moscow on January 14, Michael McFaul got down to business very actively He carried out several meetings with opposition leaders (January 17 and 22), addressed the public live on Echo of Moscow radio a media stronghold of the Russian liberals Then on January 25 he gave an interview to the influential Kommersant newspaper, and on January 30 he participated in Vladimir Pozner s TV show on nationwide Channel One Aside from media publicity, he started working thoroughly on making anti Putin rallies in Moscow more creatively (together with the founder of the oppositional Novaya Gazeta, former president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev) It seemed that the February 4 rally was bound for success However, the reshuffle in the Kremlin at the end of December 2011 led to a change in Vladimir Putin s election campaign strategy and the beginning of real counter actions to the anti Putin information campaign Also on February 4, despite the freeze of minus 20 degrees Celsius, Poklonnaya Hill saw a huge rally Though it is even hard to breathe in such cold weather, around 140,000 people gathered together, according to police And this is a big achievement of the new head of Vladimir Putin s election campaign Vyacheslav Volodin (First Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office) †So, McFaul has lost, but he has lost only in the first round of this confrontation Time has shown that he knows how to withstand pressure, quickly gets adjusted to a changing situation, and he obviously has some secret plans of how to put the Aleksey Navalny project into life So, it is too early for the Kremlin to relax the fight to prevent chaos and to preserve the Russian statehood is yet to come Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, special to RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/mcfaul-opposition-rallies-panarin-667/

"25 Jan, 2012",US-Russia relations once elections are over,"US foreign policy veteran Henry Kissinger visited Moscow and met with Vladimir Putin on January 20th Political analyst Igor Panarin believes this meeting marked the launch of a new dialogue on the future shape of US Russia relations In the article below, Panarin explains his view The meeting between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and one time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was not only intended to improve the controversy ridden relations between Russia and the United States, but also to contribute to stabilizing the inside political situation in both countries After two months of relative calm last year, Occupy rallies resumed with renewed fervor in various cities across the US The surge in street protests was coupled with a new political battle between America s Democrats and Republicans in Congress over a sudden increase in the US national debt The difficult compromise negotiated by President Barack Obama on 2 August 2011, which had allowed Washington to avoid a sovereign default, turned out to be a mere respite By mid November 2011, US public debt had topped $15 trillion, putting America on the brink of default yet again On 13 January 2012, President Obama requested the House of Representatives to raise the US debt limit by another $1 2 trillion This was supposed to be a mere formality, prearranged by the President s deal with Congress struck back in August The White House estimated that the new increase in the debt ceiling would help the administration avoid a default until the nation would be through with the presidential election scheduled for November But what had been expected to be a rubber stamping procedure, suddenly turned out to be a stonewalling when the House voted down the president s request on January 18th This unexpected violation of the deal between the White House and Congress has effectively undermined Barack Obama s chances of re election, and subsequently intensified the already ferocious infighting among the Republican presidential nominees Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich soared in the polls after Texas Governor Rick Perry dropped out of the race, urging his supporters to back Gingrich The crucially important South Carolina primaries brought Gingrich 40 percent of the poll, while his main competitor, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney scored 27 percent The official GOP candidate to challenge Obama at the November election will be apparent by the summer The world of Russian politics has been concurrently heating up since the parliamentary election in December For the first time in many years, protest rallies attracted dozens of thousands in Moscow and several other cities across the country The surge in domestic debate in both countries came at a time of yet another chill in US Russia relations over global missile defense, as well as Russia s stubborn opposition to Washington s push for military intervention in Syria and Iran Putin met with Kissinger just six weeks ahead of Russia s presidential election, scheduled for 4 March 2012 Remarkably, Putin s own campaign team has been insisting that the White House was behind the recent protest rallies in Russia, sponsoring the opposition in the hope of an orangerevolution ù Russian senior government officials have also explicitly voiced their irritation with the actions of US Ambassador Michael McFaul, who had a meeting with Russian grassroots opposition leaders on January 18th The meeting was hosted by the US Embassy in Moscow, and attended by the Deputy Secretary of State, who was visiting Russia at the time This might have been the reason for Dr Kissinger s decision to have a private conversation with Ambassador McFaul one day short of his meeting with Vladimir Putin Mr McFaul mentioned his meeting with Henry Kissinger in his blog, adding that the former Secretary of State continues to work on promoting the crucially important dialogue on strategic partnership between our two nations ù Vladimir Putin has previously referred to Henry Kissinger on numerous occasions as a foreign policy expert whose opinions are highly valuable In his book published in 2000 and titled In the First Person: Talking to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader gives a glowing account of his first encounter with Kissinger in the early 1990s Kissinger strongly impressed Putin during their first conversation, telling him about his own background in intelligence He also opined that Mikhail Gorbachev s decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Eastern Europe in the late 1980s was premature, adding that he had never quite understood Gorbachev s motivation The one time chief of US diplomacy is still considered an outstanding expert in international relations today His credentials as one of the prime architects of the US Soviet d√©tente in the 1970s are the reason why his meeting with Vladimir Putin on January 20th focused primarily on promoting the dialogue between Moscow and Washington The Russian Prime Minister set the tone for the meeting, cordially addressing Kissinger in his welcoming speech: You and I have a long standing history of highly positive relations I consider you one of the most sophisticated foreign policy experts, including the area of US Russian relations ù Kissinger promptly returned the compliment The account of the meeting and its context invite a number of conclusions The meeting took place merely four days into Michael McFaul s tenure as US Ambassador to Russia, signifying acknowledgment of the fact that the two countries relations are strained and ridden with tension, which can possibly upset the balance of power, and have an adverse affect on stability, globally Kissinger s underlying task of reintroducing shuttle diplomacy to US Russia relations reveals that the two nations foreign policy makers have exhausted their options for compromise over the contentious missile defense issue, which is becoming ever more evident as both parties increasingly tend to resort to Cold War style rhetoric and accusations A clear cut example of the latter can be found in the recent public statement made by Russian Space Agency Director Vladimir Popovkin, who suggested that the US might be behind the mysterious crash of Russia s Phobos Grunt satellite The White House seems somewhat surprised by Russia s dramatically toughened attitude vis √† vis Washington s drive for a military operation against Syria or Iran The public statements circulated by the Russian Foreign Ministry and National Security Council on 12 January 2012 were reinforced by an impressive naval exercise performed by a Russian aircraft carrier group in the Mediterranean The wargame demonstrated Russia s growing military potential, as well as its readiness to step in to prevent a Western military gamble in the Middle East The Putin Kissinger meeting offered one of the few remaining opportunities to avoid a further escalation of tension between Russia and the United States It becomes even more meaningful once you consider that Vladimir Putin is an undisputed presidential frontrunner, while Henry Kissinger happens to be a foreign policy guru for GOP, whose candidate is highly likely to become America s next president, come November I am convinced that friendly relations based on mutual respect and a balance of interest would benefit both Russia and the United States I hope such meetings will continue and eventually contribute to easing the tension in US Russia relations Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor

Crafting a new education concept for children and youth, based on securing a safe information environment for them, mainly in terms of family and the education system Putin must have carefully read comments about his program and then spent a long time digesting the criticism He is an introvert, so he is quite slow: he considers everything thoroughly and then formulates his answer So, after much consideration, Putin decided to make his point of view clearer for voters and published his vision of the Russian idea in Izvestia on January 16 He first raised the subject shortly before the 2000 presidential campaign, when he published a conceptual article called Russia at the turn of the millennium ù on Dec 30, 1999 On May 6, 2000, after presenting a run of the mill report, Putin started taking questions from the audience They were pretty tough and called for specific answers about his vision regarding Russia s future It was at that point that Putin finally revealed himself as an emotional and deeply philosophical person who is capable of strategic planning for decades ahead Nobody expected it from him, myself included Anyway, for a variety of reasons his strategic plan for Russia s transformation remains less than 25% fulfilled Today, just as when he was addressing the audience at the Government Service Academy 12 years ago, he became very emotional when attacked, and did his best to explain why he was unable to carry out his plans It was very significant that this was done publicly, because it is psychologically difficult for an introvert to take such a step It became very clear in the late 1990s that the idea of Russia as a strong nation and a world power had become very strong in the mindset of the Russians An absolute majority of the Russian people (more than 90 per cent) wanted Russia to be a strong and socially oriented nation in the 21st century Vladimir Putin s success in the presidential election of 2000 was definitely based on this new priority in Russians mentality That is why Putin explained that he, along with his associates, had to save Russia s statehood That is why † his plan to build a strong nation became the keystone of the Russian idea he presented in December 1999 After the orangerevolution in Ukraine in 2004, the Russian government took steps to rule out the possibility of a colorrevolution ù in Russia First, it used the idea of sovereign democracy, ù which was later (by 2010) replaced with a new vision that of Eurasian integration It was only in 2011 that Putin s New Ideology began to take shape It includes valuable ideas from the past and is expected to be completed by May 2012 Essentially, on January 16 Vladimir Putin invited everybody, especially the middle class, to a wider dialogue about the future, priorities, Russia s long term choice, national development and national prospects At the same time, he reminded the intelligentsia that freedom without a moral core leads to lawlessness On January 16, Vladimir Putin appeared before us all as an emotional and future oriented politician The world has entered a systemic crisis, a turbulence zone and a period of profound transformation on the way to the Sixth (ethical, intellectual and creative) Wave Only by playing an active role in developing the principles of a new world order will Russia secure a decent place in the world appropriate for Russian civilization, considering its huge educational potential And this requires public accord, which is impossible without dialogue Only then will Russia be able to preserve and further develop its moral and cultural values and become a moral core and the center of gravity for the cultures of the West and the East, the North and the South This is precisely what Putin s New Ideology is about This is why he invites the nation to discuss our national priorities Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, specially for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/putin-election-president-panarin-955/

"30 Dec, 2011",December 2011: Information War against Russia,"Moscow opposition rally of December 24th marked a new stage in the information warfare against Russia Political analyst Igor Panarin believes the society s dissatisfaction is being manipulated through the media to undermine Russia s statehood In the article below, Panarin explains his view A dirty media campaign against Russia was unleashed in August 2008, spearheaded by American and British news networks The events of December 2011 are very similar to those of August 2008 Only this time, media manipulation of public opinion is much more subtle and sophisticated, wherein the mudslingers smartly take advantage of the Russian government s actual mistakes, as well as the government s inaptitude in online media campaigning Having watched Western TV coverage of the December protests in Moscow, we can say that all the reporters chose to go down the same path of exaggeration: they tried to make the protests look bigger and more significant than they really were † The latest parliamentary election in Russia has shown that left wing parties, such as Fair Russia and the Communist Party, have significantly gained in popular support At the same time, the liberal opposition represented by the Yabloko party has suffered yet another crushing defeat In spite of these facts, the Western media are trying to paint their own picture of what Russian voters want Russia s radical opposition groups are headed by politicians who have no influence with the Russian society, having discredited themselves by nearly ruining the country while being in charge in the 1990s About 60 percent Russians explicitly state their lack of confidence in these people Nevertheless, American and British media are implying in their reports that opposition leaders enjoy nationwide support This is media manipulation at its finest (It should be noted, however, that German news outlets have been much more objective in their coverage of Russia s domestic politics )It is hardly a coincidence that many of the participants of Moscow s two opposition rallies were holding up signs in English, which were broadcast with close ups by British and American TV stations One is bound to get the impression that there is some truth to the notion that Russian opposition rallies are covertly encouraged by the American and British governments after all, there is a US government grant for Russia s civilsociety development ù ($190 million went towards that cause in 2011) December 2011 marks a new stage in the information warfare campaign against Russia Its ultimate objective is to destroy Russia s statehood, employing the methods used during Russia s Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, along with some of the latest inventions of NATO propaganda (such as the media supercarrier ù: an entire ship packed with broadcasting equipment and journalists that deployed near Tripoli to provide information support for the NATO campaign in Libya) tested in campaigns against Libya and Syria † Social networks proved to be an efficient tool for destabilizing political regimes over the course of Middle East revolutions The next step was to use the technique in Russia, and the Russian authorities turned out to be unprepared for the attack (they had been gearing themselves up against a hypothetical orangerevolution , ù similar to the one staged in Ukraine in 2004, not the Middle East scenario of 2011) Social networks are the main mechanism for mobilizing protesters for rallies in Russia Meanwhile, the Russian government does not have a system in place for countering media assaults This is a very dangerous situation, as the information warfare against Russia may become even more intense in 2012, with the presidential race already being looked upon as controversial Russia needs a reliable system in place in order to counter such media aggression A system that would be efficient in the current situation, aimed at developing the Internet A system comprised of governmental institutions as well as non government structures The key components of the system are: 1 The Presidential State Council on information policy with representation of the government s executive branch, all factions in the State Duma, the business community, and the general public 2 The position of information

the country This network should be accountable to the president A meticulous dialogue with journalists from the Echo of Moscow radio station and other liberal media is also needed I am convinced that

"15 Dec, 2011",Politically-active youth a good legacy of ‚ÄòPutin‚Äôs regime‚Äô - PM,"Commenting on recent election protests, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said that if, as a result of Putin s regime ù, young people have become more active in voicing their position, that is a good thing Putin said that it is absolutely normal ù that people express their opinion about processes developing in the country in its economy, politics and social life He stressed, though, that meetings and rallies should be held in accordance with the law and expressed hope that it would happen in exactly that way The premier is holding his annual live Q&A session with Russian citizens, which is broadcast by major federal TV channels and radio stations The special program is called Talk with Vladimir Putin: Continued ù The very first question he was asked referred to the situation around the December 4 parliamentary poll, which brought victory to the Putin led United Russia party The vote was followed by a wave of protests throughout the country against the vote result and alleged polling violations Putin noted that mainly active youngsters who are capable of voicing their stance clearly participated in the rallies I am glad about that And if that is the result of Putin s regime, it s good, I don t see anything outrageous about that, ù he said Speaking about the results of the State Duma elections, the PM said in his opinion they reflect the real distribution of political forces in the country ù The fact United Russia got fewer votes in these elections than in 2007 is understandable, since the country has gone though a very difficult period ù of the world economic crisis, which affected many citizens Therefore it is now easier for the opposition to recruit ù new supporters than it was before But still, United Russia retained its leading position and it s a very good result, ù Putin said He stressed that the opposition is always ù unhappy with election results and that is also absolutely normal In order to avoid the very possibility of any election fraud, the prime minister suggested installing webcams that would work round the clock in all the voting stations in the country We also need to make sure that all political forces which got into parliament are represented at election commissions in accordance with the law, he added The PM called on citizens not to ignore the upcoming presidential poll in 2012 He said they should not follow the pattern of yes, we would have voted for him, but they will still do something there, and I need to go urgently to get potatoes, to go to the country house ù No one but you will do anything, ù he underlined Only you will decide who will do foreign policy and represent our country on the international arena, who will ensure internal and external security, and deal with social issues, who will develop the economy, ù he said Vladimir Putin who is running for the presidency in March next year was asked what his mission would be if he returns to the Kremlin He said that a key goal would become the greater stability of the Russian political system and its resistance to external impacts We must broaden democracy so that people stay in touch with authorities and trust them more, Putin said The second task would be the modernization of the economy Putin pointed out that the idea of innovation ù should nest in the brain of every Russian citizen and be part of general policy He also stressed that the social sphere should be developed so that no one feels abandoned by the state ùPutin assured that if citizens entrust him at the presidential elections, he will be carrying out that mission with pleasure and with the same energy as before The premier noted that lately the word stability ù has acquired a certain negative connotation Stability does not mean stagnation, it means sustainable development This is how I understand stability, Putin said He stressed that the achievements of previous years must be retained in the future Editor in Chief of Echo of Moscow radio station Aleksey Venediktov asked Vladimir Putin what he would reply, not to the opposition, but to ordinary citizens who took to streets for the first time on December 10, and who believe that their votes were stolen ù I would repeat that if this is the result of the Putin regime , I can only say that I am satisfied with this result, ù the PM responded As for alleged falsifications during the parliamentary election, Putin said that on the demand of the opposition some votes have been recounted He noted, though, that after the final results have been counted, all such instances will be considered in courts I count on the courts to do so objectively, ù he observed The prime minister reiterated that he has nothing against criticism When asked if the recent protests were a sign of a coming colorrevolution ù, Putin said Lawful protests yes, criticism of the authorities yes But it s unacceptable to let us draw into destabilization processes managed from abroad ùHe went on to say that during the orangerevolution in Ukraine, some Russian opposition members were official counselors of the then President Viktor Yushchenko and are currently transferring this practice to Russian soil ù Vladimir Putin also commented on the dismissal of former finance minister Aleksey Kudrin earlier this year When asked whether he will include Kudrin in the government if he becomes president, he said, Aleksey Leonidovich Kudrin never left my team He is my long standing friend ù Such people as Kudrin are always needed, both in the actual and future government We ll find a place for him, ù he added The premier admitted that they are divided on some issues, but these are not principal differences ù When a presenter read the prime minister a question submitted through the internet asking what his attitude to the voting ballot with an obscene address on it was (the story was reported in this week s edition of the Kommersant Vlast magazine), Putin said that such an attitude was nothing new When there was a war in the Northern Caucasus I saw a lot of cartoons about myself and heard lots of things, ù Putin said, adding that Western journalists were especially active in spreading this sort of information I am sure that I was right back then and I am sure I am still right ùAs for this particular phrase, Putin noted that it was important where it was made it was made in London, where Russian citizens were taking part in the vote at the embassy And we all know who of Russians reside in London and for what reason, ù Putin said, hinting at the fact that there is no extradition treaty between the UK and Russia, and a lot of people who face criminal investigation in Russia choose the UK as their country of residence Above all, Putin said that he had personally called upon Russian citizens to come and vote in the last elections And that was what they did, and for this I have already thanked them, ù Putin said, to cheers from the audience Another question dealt with a recent Twitter message by US Republican senator John McCain who warned Putin of the fate of Muammar Gaddafi This is the fate [McCain] wants for Russia, not for me, ù the prime minister commented He also criticized the violent scenes of the killing of the Libyan leader shown on TV, stressing that he had been executed without trial Putin added that military rhetoric of Senator McCain is probably linked to his past, namely with the fact that he fought in Vietnam, and sees force as the only efficient means of international politics He was not only taken hostage, he spent significant time in a pit in the ground † anyone would go crazy in such circumstances, ù Putin said Some want to put Russia aside, so that it does not obstruct them from ruling in the world, ù he added We have our own opinion, we are leading independent international policies, this, of course impedes someone ù Putin said that the government s assessment of governors work was not based primarily on the performance of United Russia party at the elections in regions, but sometimes a lack of popular support is a sign for governors that it is time to resign The government has elaborated the list of criteria for the assessment of governors efficiency and there is no connection with United Russia s results in regional elections, ù the PM said However, in some regions the governors were directly participating in elections and failed to achieve positive results and this testifies to the level of support, or lack of support, from the citizens who live in one territory or another And in some cases if I were in the governors place I would consider submitting my resignation, ù Putin said Addressing whether or not the regions that did not support United Russia at the elections will be excluded from programs of social support, Putin said such rumors were total rubbish Such things never happen in any country and it will not happen in Russia, ù Putin said The issue of the forthcoming presidential election could not be avoided during the Q&A session Vladimir Putin was asked what he thinks about billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov s decision to join the presidential race I can t say that I wish him success as I m also running, but I m sure that he will be a worthy and strong rival, ù the prime minister responded As a citizen of Russia who has reached a certain age, ù the businessman has every right to do so Putin added He also reminded of Prokhorov s failed attempt at leading the Right Cause party Mikhail Dmitrievich [Prokhorov] is a persistent person, he never gives up As I see it, he decided to use a new platform in order to promote the ideas which he believes are right for the country What he is doing is within the law and the constitution, ù Vladimir Putin noted He then commented on the statement that there is no opposition in Russia Judging by what I ve seen in recent days on TV, on the internet, on the radio and even here in the studio, in the course of this Q&A session ¶the claim that we don t have opposition and that it does not have the opportunity to speak out is something of a literary license, ù Putin said, adding that the country does need to move toward further liberalization We can t do only one thing in this country We can t create regional parties, especially in ethnic republics, where this can result in nationalism and separatism, ù he stressed He also said that it is necessary to treat all citizens with respect, even those who do not accept the authorities in principle ù But there are people who hold Russian passports but act in the interests of the foreign state and on foreign funds We will try to establish contact with them as well, ù Putin went on to say Although sometimes this is useless and impossible ùHowever, he noted that if he becomes president, he is going to work with everyone without exception Answering a question as to whether the return to direct elections of regional governors was possible, Vladimir Putin noted that he had personally invented the current system and had valid reasons for doing so He recalled that this system was introduced in the middle of last decade Back then, the situation in the country was unstable, military operations were held in the North Caucasus where semi criminal elites were acting Putin said that at that time governors who were elected by secret ballot were often basing their power on criminal structures and separatist movements However, now it may be time to consider changes, although they should be introduced gradually We must keep the presidential filter that would block the forces that promote separatism or, God forbid, a split from the Russian Federation, ù he said A system could be introduced in which all parties elected to regional parliaments submit their candidates for gubernatorial posts to the president After that, those whose candidacy is approved by the country s leader could compete for the job in regional elections Currently the party that wins elections proposes candidates for the posts of governors to the president, who makes the choice It is then submitted to regional parliaments for approval When a question arrived by phone asking Putin to detail his attitude towards the slogan it is enough to feed the Caucasus ù † a protest against allegedly excessive state support to North Caucasus regions † Putin said that such an attitude is a mistake and the support will continue Putin said that such sentiments are caused by the fact that more and more people from the North Caucasus region are arriving in big Russian cities and cannot adjust to city life and new realities Thus, to counter the slogan the authorities must change life in the Northern Caucasus in such way that people choose not to leave their home places We need to develop the production, economy, social sphere so that no one wants to get away from there For this, we must invest money there This does not mean that we must throw in money without thinking, ù Putin said The PM added that the allegations about the high corruption level in the Northern Caucasus were groundless I know there are many questions to [leader of the Chechen Republic] Ramzan Kadyrov, but look at how he has restored the city of Grozny This is unprecedented And I can say that Chechnya has the minimum level of corruption component, ù Putin said The PM added that improving life in the North Caucasus region will eventually reduce the number of those who join the illegal armed formations, which is a good thing When a listener asked Putin his possible behavior would have been if he was in power during the breakup of the Soviet Union, the prime minister stressed that there cannot be a subjunctive mode in history, but in such a situation he would persistently and fearlessly fight for the country s integrity What would I do? We should have started the economic changes and reforms in the Soviet Union in time, and strengthened them with democratic changes in the country We should have been fighting for the territorial integrity of the state persistently and without fear, ù Putin said Putin added that in late 90s the situation was much more dramatic than before the breakup of the Soviet Union The economy collapsed as a result of the 1998 crisis, the social sphere was on the zero level and the army ceased to exist And we faced an aggression from the international terrorism, a civil war started And the remaining part of Russia was on the brink of collapse And you know what particular steps I took to preserve the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, ù Putin said Finally, Vladimir Putin reiterated that, in the event of his victory in the presidential election, Dmitry Medvedev will head the cabinet United Russia, led by Medvedev, received the majority in the State Duma This allows the government to work steadily It is an unconditional victory, ù Putin said Vladimir Putin answered questions both from guests in the studio and citizens participating in TV link ups with Russian cities Questions were also submitted by phone, text message and online The most interesting and relevant questions received by the call center were forwarded to Putin during the live broadcast Some famous persons were in the studio to take part in the Talk with Vladimir Putin ù A number of celebrities also accepted the invitation to work in the call center together with regular phone operators It was the 10th live Q&A session for Vladimir Putin The program lasted for four and a half hours, breaking last year s record of 4 hours and 26 minutes The prime minister responded to 88 questions in total Around 1 8 million questions were submitted during the broadcast After the official part, Putin continued his conversation with the journalists in the studio Among other things, the prime minister was asked if he would consider an appeal for a pardon by jailed former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky Putin said that if Khodorkovsky filed such an appeal which he has not done so far he would give it consideration But for a start, I should be elected as president, ù he said RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/official-word/putin-q-and-a-annual-session-785/

"10 May, 2011",Nationalists attack WWII veterans and Russian diplomats in W. Ukraine,"Not everyone regards Victory Day as a cause for celebration In Western Ukraine, nationalist party members have violently disrupted a memorial service as veterans paid tribute to those who perished in the war A holiday for millions, but a street brawl for others Unlike most of the post Soviet region on May 9th, the western Ukrainian city of Lvov became a vicious display of neo Nazism Several thousand activists from radical nationalist parties blocked the entrance to Red Army soldiers cemeteries, preventing war veterans from getting inside and paying tribute Some in this part of Ukraine do not see May 9th as a reason to celebrate, believing the Soviet period to be worse than enduring Nazi occupation The St George s ribbon is traditionally worn on Victory Day to commemorate those who died in the Great Patriotic War However, putting it on your lapel on this day in Lvov would have constituted a serious risk regardless of whether you were a veteran or not The ribbons were forcibly ripped from the chests of those who were heading to the graveyards Those who simply wished to pay tribute and to show their respect were also bombarded with abusive chants such as death to the Muscovites ù, Nazi salutes, rocks and smoke bombs That s how Lvov marked May 9th Activists of the Liberty nationalist organization put up fierce resistance to the police, stoning police buses carrying reinforcements, throwing smoke grenades and shaking the fence around the Hill of Glory, where some 100 people, among them World War II veterans, had gathered for a commemorative ceremony Such scenes surprised even the locals, who had grown used to protests on Victory Day, with nationalists wiping their feet on the red victory banner Here, in this picture are my brothers and my father the liberator of this land from the fascists, ù local resident Vladimir told RT But these people here do not let me go inside the cemetery to lay flowers on his grave This is a disgrace ùTheir heroes are people regarded worldwide as Nazi collaborators Replica shirts depicting Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevich, the founders of the 1940s insurgent army, are a big hit here They are seen as freedom fighters, even though for a while they fought alongside the Nazi army and killed civilians, Jews and Russians in a gruesome manner Actions like these are an attempt to write off the sacrifices the country made to be liberated from the Nazis and a result of pro fascist propaganda, like the rehabilitation of Nazi collaborators, like Shukhevich and Bandera, ù says Vadim Kolesnichenko, a deputy in Ukraine s Rada This is only a part of a wider picture A warped perception of the past is making waves in other former Soviet states, namely in the Baltic states Latvia and Estonia, where SS marches glorifying Nazi legions are not uncommon As a Russian diplomatic delegation was on its way to the Hill to pay tribute to those who perished during the war, a group of nationalists grabbed a wreath which Oleg Astakhov, Russia s Consul General, was to lay at the military cemetery The wreath I was to lay at the Hill of Glory memorial at the military cemetery was shredded to pieces, he said in an interview with the ZIK magazine according to Interfax Today s events in Western Ukraine are part of a common trend for some corners of the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic States, where rewriting of the common history has been widely instigated and Victory Day, therefore, is not celebrated Supporters of such views claim that the Soviet period was worse than the Nazi occupation Nonetheless, the scale of Lvov s Monday violence is unprecedented even by local standards With all that, such views, even though common in Lvov, do not dominate Ukrainian society Most of the country is celebrating the holiday and remembers millions of those who died liberating their country from Nazi Germany Moscow expects Ukrainian authorities to bring nationalists to account for attacking veterans during a memorial service on May 9 Ukraine is a very diverse nation because for the first time in its history Ukraine united in 1939 as a republic of the Soviet Union, said Dmitry Babich from Russia Profile magazine To begin preventing Nazi loving nationalism in Western Ukraine, the attitude of the Western media towards Ukrainian nationalism should first of all change, shared Babich The sentimental attitude towards Ukrainian nationalism that we have seen in European and the American media since the beginning of the 1990s and particularly during the so called orangerevolution is simplification that has led to lots of misunderstandings Even president Yushchenko was idealized for a long time by westerners until at the end of his rule he suddenly made [Stepan] Bandera, a very controversial extremist figure of the Ukrainian nationalist movement, he [Yushchenko] suddenly made him a Hero of Ukraine ùUnfortunately, a part of the Western press encourages the opinion that at one time Hitler could have been better than Stalin and it resents the Soviet past in former Soviet republics Russian historian Leonid Dobrokhotov has told RT why, in his opinion, these attempts to rewrite history take place in some of the former Soviet republics Millions of Ukrainians were heroically fighting as a part of the Red Army against the Nazis during the Second World War, the Great Patriotic War A lot of Baltic [people] did the same, ù he said At the same time, a lot of Ukrainians, especially [those] from Western Ukraine, and some Lithuanians, Estonians and especially Latvians were a part of the Nazis, the Nazi battalions nationalist Baltic battalions under the command of [German] Nazis, who did massacres and fought against the Red Army and against the civilians ùAfter WWII, the nationalist movements were suppressed in the Soviet Union, Dobrokhotov continued However, decades later, when the USSR was disintegrating, the West strongly supported the independence of those republics from Russia Now, the West still regards these former parts of the Soviet Union as its close allies and turns a blind eye to the Nazi tendencies that occur there, the historian concluded Glyn Ford, National Treasurer of the Anti Nazi League, agrees that similar tendencies are common throughout Europe these days The danger is that the people are beginning to forget what we fought for and what the veterans died for, ù he told RT As we are seeing, the re emergence of far right forces and nationalist forces that, really, in many senses resemble exactly those that emerged with Hitler in the 1930s ù You are seeing the emergence of far right parties almost all the way across the European Union, apart, possibly, from those countries that have been inoculated a little by their own experiences, in Spain and Portugal, ù he added The danger is, if we forget, we are likely to, if you want, replicate it again in the future, ù Glyn Ford warned We have seen this before, ù says Cornelius Schwarzler of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service We have seen this in many countries in Europe, and we should also remember how much time it took us in Central Europe and Western Europe to even raise the subject of the Holocaust and Nazi crimes, ù he said It took us ages and, I think, from that point of view we should be aware of the fact that Ukraine is certainly in the learning process, and Ukraine will need time ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/wwii-veterans-ukraine-police/
