"31 Dec, 2019",Joe Biden's man shows the world why US policy towards Russia has completely failed,"It s entirely possible that Joe Biden could be the next US President If so, buckle your seatbelts because the advice he s getting on Russia is, almost certainly, dangerously wrong Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Regular readers will know of my deep scorn for Russia Watchers ù † Westerners who, as a rule, purport to have an understanding of the country beyond their actual competence Sadly, they are an unavoidable hazard on this beat, much as snow is to Siberia, or blazing summer sun to Krasnodar For the most part they are more of an amusement than a menace, self important but not remotely influential such as Molly McKew, Mark Galeotti and Malcolm Nance Safely ensconced on the punditry circuit, or Think Tank racket, where they can, thankfully, do little real harm However, problems start when they gain the ear of policymakers Probably the best example being Michael McFaul, who even managed to land the US ambassador s gig in Moscow, under Barack Obama Once landed in the Russian capital, he then proceeded to scorch all around him: like a toddler let loose with a box of matches at a fireworks shop It s notable that since his disastrous term and bear in mind some elements in Russia clearly worked to undermine his endeavours † Washington has appointed experienced, and competent, diplomats Michael Carpenter is another illustration of what happens when an inept gibberish babbler is let loose in the corridors of power A small potato who has somehow risen, without a trace, to be regarded as a Russia expert in Washington And the fact he s acquired this status serves to expose the corrosion of American foreign policy expertise It also shines some light upon why US officials continue to get Russia wrong, by underestimating its abilities, misunderstanding its concerns and confusing its intentions Remember Barack Obama s line about Russia being no more than a regional power † and John McCain s insistence that it was a gas station masquerading as a country? Both delivered before Moscow helped to upend US plans for Syria Fast forward to today and Western media isworriedabout growing Russian influence inAfrica Carpenter is a policy advisor at the Penn Biden Centre, ù the Think Tank of the former US Vice President Although he tends to come across more as a propagandist Which is presumably why he s also employed as a lobbyist/fellow at NATO s Atlantic Council adjunct According to his ownbiography, which I am copy/pasting verbatim: Carpenter previously served in the Pentagon as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense with responsibility for Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia, the Balkans, and Conventional Arms Control He also served in the White House as a foreign policy advisor to Vice President Joe Biden as well as on the National Security Council as Director for Russia † Previously, Dr Carpenter was a career Foreign Service Officer with the State Department ù So, in other words, this man had a lot of influence And he s presumably being kept in a sort of cold storage until the Democrats reassume control of the White House (perhaps under Biden himself), and he can spend another few years misinforming power brokers Just before New Year 2018, he posted a Twitter Thread, which began I ve been asked what I expect from Russia in 2019 Here s my top 10 list of events to watch out for (not in any particular order of probability) ù Carpenter kept it pinned to his profile throughout the year Only removing it a few days ago Given how it turned out, I initially thought it was remarkable chutzpah But, upon reflection, it s clear Carpenter meant it as a f*ck you ù to real experts, because, as a system insider, he knows Washington is no longer interested in substance when it comes to Russia Today, we are a long way from George Kennan Here is what Biden s man predicted #1 A military incursion into Ukraine The most likely target is the canal that feeds fresh water from the Dnieper river to Crimea Without this water, Crimea s agricultural sector goes under Also look for Russia to seek complete dominance over the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait 1) A military incursion into Ukraine The most likely target is the canal that feeds freshwater from the Dnieper river to Crimea Without this water, Crimea s agricultural sector goes under Also, look for Russia to seek complete dominance over the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait ù None of this happened Instead, Moscow Kiev relations thawed slightly under new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 2) A military flare up in Nagorno Karabakh if Prime Minister Pashinyan does not cater to corrupt Russian interests in Armenia ù This region was quiet in 2019 And Russia maintains good relations with both Azerbaijan and Armenia 3) Pressure on President Lukashenka (sic) to allow Russia to build a military base in Belarus, especially if the US green lights the construction of Fort Trump in Poland If Minsk resists, the Kremlin will be prepared to execute an Anschluss operation ù Russia did not invade Belarus and made no attempt to build an armed forces base in the country Minsk previously, in 2018, rejected the notion of a joint air facility on its territory, described as an unpleasant episode, ù by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Not quite the language of war 4) Russia and Iran take control of eastern Syria as the US withdraws and Turkey engages in cross border attacks on Kurdish fighters Over time this guarantees that disenfranchised Sunni Arabs radicalize into ISIS 2 0 I m no Middle East expert, and unlike Carpenter I don t pretend to be, but I know the Americans haven t withdrawn and ISIS 2 0 hasn t shown up 5) A growing Russian military presence in Libya helps General Haftar consolidate control of the country, which becomes a Russian protectorate Again I don t know much about Libya, but I think I d have heard if it became a Russian protectorate ù 6) Moscow arms the Taliban with more sophisticated weapons as the US draws down its forces and the NATO ISAF mission is stretched to the breaking point Moscow displaces the US as the chief power broker in Afghanistan and the Taliban comes back to power None of this came to pass 7) Moscow supports Bosnian President Milorad Dodik s efforts to separate Republika Srpska from the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, risking a renewed ethnic conflict in the Balkans There have been no credible reports suggesting this happened And Bosnia formed a government, onlylast week, after a 14 month impasse No easy task given agreement is required between Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Muslim Bosniaks 8) The Russian Saudi relationship blossoms as Moscow sends more weapons to Saudi Arabia and coordinates further oil supply cuts This is the only prediction you could say Carpenter got half right Oil supply coordination did continue (but that was pretty obviously going to happen) Nevertheless, there were no new weapons deals hatched 9) EU sanctions on Russia fall apart as one of the EU member states breaks consensus in return for an undisclosed energy deal with Russia The most likely candidates: Hungary, Italy, Austria Not a single EU member state broke ranks on sanctions 10) The Kremlin s active measures campaign in the US goes into overdrive as Russia seeks to shape the 2020 presidential field Dark money becomes the main tool of Kremlin influence as Russia concludes that financing organic disinformation is more effective than offshore ops There is no evidence to support this theory In fact, experts in Moscow suggest the Kremlin will do everything possible to avoid anything which may be perceived as interference in the 2020 US election This is because a) Russian leaders don t want to make life even more difficult for President Trump, and b) hope to avoid a repeat of the hysteria of the past few years If Carpenter had made errors in a few of his forecasts, you could cut him a bit of slack But the fact he was so spectacularly inaccurate, yet doesn t seem remotely embarrassed about it, is incredibly depressing It also serves to prove a point I have made for years now: it seems nobody in America, or the UK, has ever suffered career damage as a result of being wrong about Russia Instead, they appear to fail up ù The pundits and pontificators know this And it encourages them to become more shrill in their disinformation and agitprop Update: Mr Carpenter replies that he managed the Open Skies program at the Pentagon & gets it far better than I do He also says I am a dumbass ps reason for blank tweet is I reposted, owing to a typo in original https://t co/EYTmFM0FWa Back in August, I called out Carpenter on Twitter after he pushed falsehoods about the Open Skies ù observation program From which the US is reportedly considering withdrawing The former government official launched an extraordinary personal attack, labeling me a dumbass, ù before resorting to the last refuge of the scoundrel by blocking my account I m too polite to respond in kind, but it s quite something to have your intelligence questioned by someone who is clearly out to lunch when it comes to his own purported area of expertise",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/477209-us-policy-russia-biden/
"3 Nov, 2019",Nasty Russians harassed a sick American diplomat? That‚Äôs ‚Äòfake news‚Äô says Foreign Ministry,"The New York Times has spun a tale of Russian treachery based on its usual anonymous sources Though the Russian Foreign Ministry stepped in to correct the record, the paper didn t let facts get in the way of a good story According to the Times, the debacle kicked off in August, when Russian officials delayed a sick American envoy from leaving Moscow for treatment, part of a Cold War style harassment campaign ùagainst US diplomats The man in question, a military attache at the American embassy in Moscow, fell ill and needed evacuation to Germany for hospital treatment According to theNYT, his plane was delayed for hours for no apparent reason, ùdespite protests from embassy officials and the State Department in Washington The story ticks all the Russiagate boxes Neither the State Department or the Pentagon would give details of the incident, so anonymous officials ùwere quoted instead The paper also fitted the story into a wider anti Russia conspiracy, calling it the latest episode of a long running campaign of harassment against American diplomats in Russia ù Even the newspaper s subhead proclaimed that Russian intimidation of American officials has reached levels unseen since the Cold War ùEvidently, delayed flights are comparable to the world s biggest superpowers threatening each other with nuclear war A bold statement, were it true In a response to the Times, sent before publication but selectively clipped, the Russian Foreign Ministry explained that five and a half hours before the attache s flight, the airline announced a one hour delay Upon arrival at the airport, the sick man s entourage were fast tracked through security, and were then found to have the wrong papers, due to an error with their earlier charter flight The paper mix up which had the entourage identified as crew instead of passengers was resolved in 20 minutes, and the flight took off five minutes before its scheduled departure time Little of this official explanation was included in the story, and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova again decried the article on Sunday, calling it fake news, ùand a scandal; a forgery in its purest form ù And of course, a good Russia yarn wouldn t be complete without some conspiracy peddling from former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul When I was ambassador, we felt like we were under siege all the time, ùMcFaul told the Times He said that delaying a medical flight would be the kind of classic harassment that for many years now, our people have been putting up with It s inexcusable, it s horrible ù This is the same Michael McFaul who oncecomparedRussians purchasing Facebook ads in the runup to the 2016 election to the 9/11 attacks,warnedAmerican tourists to steer clear of Russia, in case they be jailed for spying, and penned a research paper in 2005 advocating American led regime change in Moscow Anti Russia protestations are also big money for McFaul, who wrote a book lambasting Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin last year, while Russiagate hysteria was at its height In her response, Zakharova reminded the NYT about the time a Russian diplomat in Washington was tasked with bringing cancer medicine to Moscow for former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov some time before 2015 The diplomat was detained by American intelligence and had his belongings seized The medicine was only delivered to Moscow when the then Secretary of State John Kerry intervened Relations between Washington and Moscow remain generally hostile, ùthe NYT s article claims That may be true, but the paper s writers clearly didn t pause to think that presenting Cold War spy fiction as news might just have something to do with it ",https://www.rt.com/usa/472538-russia-diplomat-fake-news/
"12 Aug, 2019",Really? McFaul 'plants US flag' in Twitter to claim it as free speech sanctuary,"Michael McFaul says he can say whatever he wants on Twitter because it s an American platform Yeah, the very same Twitter that shadowbans, silences alternative media, and hosts fake Russian bots that meddle in US elections The former US ambassador in Russia lauded Twitter as a supposed champion of the First Amendment to fend off his critics Apparently, some Russians didn t like McFaul s cheering of recent opposition protests in Moscow, so he offered them an indignant and somewhat patronizing rebuke HeyRussians, writing here on an AMERICAN platform, I have a constitutional right to say whatever I want about American or Russian politics, he tweeted No one is forcing you to read what I say Stop with the demands for censorship Russian sovereignty does not extend to Twitter HeyRussians, writing here on an AMERICAN platform, I have a constitutional right to say whatever I want about American or Russian politics No one is forcing you to read what I say Stop with the demands for censorship Russian sovereignty does not extend to Twitter The apparent claim that Twitter is a place under exclusive American sovereignty is inaccurate Twitter, like any global social network, has tocomplywith national laws to operate in different countries Even a bastion of free speech like America occasionally asks the tech giant to remove this or that tweet or ban this or that user Russia is admittedlymore successfulin securing such content removals with a 46 percent compliance rate recorded in the second half of 2018 But the US may be proud to be avery †efficientextractor of user information from the tech giant In the same period, 73 percent of over 2,000 American information requests were granted by Twitter Basically, if you post something bad, Russia wants it erased while the US wants to know who you are wonder why? But let s not be coy McFauldoesn t careabout those legalities anyway, and he was clearly referring to political speech, not calls to kill all members of a certain ethnic group or threats of revenge rape, which hopefully we all agree have no place on any platform Sure, one can freely say a lot on Twitter with impunity For example, share a video showing a protest in Bahrain with a caption: 300,000 Iranians are marching to lynch local Chekists [intelligence officers] and what have you done for Russia? Mistakes do happen But there are other kinds of speech that Twitter doesn t tolerate much For example, peddling a wrong conspiracy theory You see Russian active measures behind every bush and smear every person you don t like as a useful idiot or a paid Putin agent?Here syour blue checker and 290,000 followers You think Muslims and social progressives conspire to undermine your cherished way of life?Banhammer! Being a news source or a watchdog with an agenda that deviates too much from that of the corporate baseline is also frowned upon by Twitter, especially with a crucial midterm election in sight Dittofor people like anti war advocate Peter Van Buren, who happen to get on the wrong side of a person with a dedicated cadre of followers and a good idea of how to game Twitter s suspension algorithms There is also the so called shadowbanning the alleged practice of hiding unwanted voices from the general public Many people believe that this is what theself admittedleft leaning company is doing to conservatives Are they right? Well, with Twitter s algorithms protected as corporate secrets and its rules mercurial and labyrinthine, who knows for sure? Maybe not even@jack All this Silicon Valley censorship was sent into overdrive after Russiagate Tech giants were accused of allowing the Kremlin to abuse their platforms to meddle in elections in the US and worldwide, and they rushed to protect democracy from the Moscow meme menace Maybe it was because being AMERICAN, they are true patriots, or maybe they just feared their bottom line would be hurt otherwise Isn t it ironic how after that a US cyber firm faked a Russian interference campaign in an Alabama election by running an army of falsified Russian bots, bragged about it, and later was called to write a Congress report on how the Russians were the bad guys?

"5 Dec, 2018",New Cold War is more dangerous than the one the world survived ‚Äì Stephen Cohen," War With Russia? , like the biography of a living person, is a book without an end The title is a warning akin to what the late Gore Vidal termed a journalistic alert system ù not a prediction Hence the question mark I cannot foresee the future The book s overarching theme is informed by past and current facts, not by any political agenda, ideological commitment, or magical prescience The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk Hegel To restate that theme: The new US Russian Cold War is more dangerous than was its 40 year predecessor that the world survived The chances are even greater that this one could result, inadvertently or intentionally, in actual war between the two nuclear superpowers Herein lies another ominous indication During the preceding Cold War, the possibility of nuclear catastrophe was in the forefront of American mainstream political and media discussion, and of policy making During the new one, it rarely seems to be even a concern In the latter months of 2018, the facts and the mounting crises they document grow worse, especially in the US political media establishment, where, as I have argued, the new Cold War originated and has been repeatedly escalated Consider a few examples, some of them not unlike political and media developments during the run up to the US war in Iraq or, historians have told us, how the great powers sleepwalked ù into World War I: Russiagate s core allegations îUS Russian collusion, treason îall remain unproven Yet they have become a central part of the new Cold War If nothing else, they severely constrain President Donald Trump s capacity to conduct crisis negotiations with Moscow while they further vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin for having, it is widely asserted, personally ordered an attack on America ù during the 2016 presidential campaign Some Hollywood liberals had earlier omitted the question mark, declaring, We are at war ù In October 2018, the would be titular head of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, added her voice to this reckless allegation,flatly statingthat the United States was attacked by a foreign power ù and equating it with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks ù Clinton may have been prompted by another outburst of malpractice byThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post On September 20 and 23, respectively, those exceptionally influential papers devoted thousands of words, illustrated with sinister prosecutorial graphics, to special retellings of the Russiagate narrative they had assiduously promoted for nearly two years, along with the narrative s serial fallacies, selective and questionable history, and factual errors Again, for example, the now infamous Paul Manafort, who was Trump s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, was said to have been pro Kremlin ù during his time as a lobbyist for Ukraine under then President Viktor Yanukovych, when in fact he was pro European Union Again, Trump s disgraced national security adviser, Gen Michael Flynn, was accused of troubling ùcontacts when he did nothing wrong or unprecedented in having conversations with a Kremlin representative on behalf of President elect Trump Again, the two papers criminalized the idea, as the Times put it, that the UnitedStates and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest, ù once the premise of d√©tente And again, the Times, while assuring readers that its Special Report ù is what we now know with certainty, ù buried a related acknowledgment deep in its some 10,000 words: No public evidence has emerged showing that [Trump s] campaign conspired with Russia ù (The white collar criminal indictments and guilty pleas cited were so unrelated that they added up to Russiagate without Russia ) Astonishingly, neither paper gave any credence to anemphatic statementby the Post s own Bob Woodward înormally considered the most authoritative chronicler of Washington s political secrets îthat, after two years of research, he had found no evidence of collusion betweenTrump and Russia Nor were the Times, the Post, and

years earlier as complaints about Russian meddling ù in the US presidential election became by October 2018, forThe New Yorkerand other publications, an accusation that the Kremlin had actually put Donald Trump in the White House For this seditious charge, there was also no convincing evidence înor any precedent in American history At a higher level, by fall 2018, current and former US officials were making nearly unprecedented threats against Moscow The ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison,threatenedto take out ù any Russian missiles she thought violated a 1987 treaty, a step that would certainly risk nuclear war The secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke,threateneda naval blockade ù of Russia In yet another Russophobic outburst, the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley,declaredthat lying, cheating and rogue behavior ù are a norm of Russianculture ù These may have been outlandish statements by untutored political appointees, but they again inescapably raised the question: Who was making Russia policy in Washington † President Trump, with his avowed policy of cooperation, ù or someone else? But how to explain, other than as unbridled extremism, thecommentsby Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, himself a longtime professor of Russian politics and favored mainstream commentator? According to McFaul, Russia had become a rogue state, ù its policies criminal actions ù and the world s greatest threat ù It had to be countered by preemptive sanctions that would go into effect automatically ù î every day, ù if deemed necessary Considering the possibility of crushing ù sanctions proposedrecentlyby a bipartisan group of US senators, this would be nothing less than a declaration of permanent war against Russia: economic war, but war nonetheless Meanwhile, other new Cold War fronts were becoming more fraught with hot war, none more so than Syria On September 17, Syrian missiles accidentally shot down an allied Russian surveillance aircraft, killing all 15 crew members The cause was combat subterfuge by Israeli warplanes in the area The reaction in Moscow was indicative and potentially ominous At first, Putin, who had developed good relations with Israel s political leadership, said the incident was an accident caused by the fog of war His own Defense Ministry, however, loudly protested that Israel was responsible Putin quickly retreated to a more hard line position, and in the end vowed to send to Syria Russia s highly effective S 300 surface to air defense system, a prize long sought by both Syria and Iran Clearly, Putin was not the ever aggressive Kremlin autocrat ù unrelentingly portrayed by US mainstream media A moderate in the Russian context, he again made a major decision by balancing conflicting groups and interests In this instance, he accommodated long standing hard liners in his own security establishment The result is yet another Cold War trip wire With the S 300s installed in Syria, Putin could in effect impose a no fly zone ù over large areas of the country, which has been ravaged by war due, in no small part, to the presence of several foreign powers (Russia and Iran are there legally; the United States and Israel are not ) If so, this means a new red line ù that Washington and its ally Israel will have to decide whether or not to cross Considering the mania in Washington and in the mainstream media, it is hard to be confident that restraint will prevail In keeping with his Russia policy, President Trump may reasonably be inclined to join Moscow s peace process, though it is unlikely the mostly Democrat inspired Russiagate party would permit him to do so Now another Cold War front has also become morefraught, the US Russian proxy war in Ukraine having acquired a new dimension In addition to the civil war in Donbass, Moscow and Kiev have been challenging each other s ships in the Sea of Azov, near the newly built bridge connecting Russia with Crimea On November 25, this erupted into a small but potentially explosive military conflict at sea Trump is being pressured to help Kiev escalate the maritime war yet another potential trip wire Here, too, the president should instead put his administration s weight behind the long stalled Minsk peace accords But that approach also seems to be ruled out by Russiagate, which by October 6 included yet another Times columnist, Frank Bruni,brandingall such initiatives by Trump as pimping for Putin ù After five years of extremism, as demonstrated by these recent examples of risking war with Russia, there remained, for the first time in decades of Cold War history, no countervailing forces in Washington † no pro d√©tente wing of the Democratic or Republican Party, no influential anti Cold War opposition anywhere, no real public debate There was only Trump, with all the loathing he inspired, and even he had not reminded the nation or his own party that the presidents who initiated major episodes of d√©tente in the 20th century were also Republicans † Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan This too seemed to be an inadmissible alternative fact ù And so the eternal question, not only for Russians: What is to be done? There is a ray of light, though scarcely more In August 2018,Gallupasked Americans what kind of policy toward Russia they favored Even amid the torrent of vilifying Russiagate allegations and Russophobia, 58 percent wanted to improve relations with Russia, ù as opposed to 36 percent who preferred strong diplomatic and economic steps against Russia ù This reminds us that the new Cold War, from NATO s eastward expansion and the 2014 Ukrainian crisis to Russiagate, has been an elite project Why US elites, after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, ultimately chose Cold War rather than partnership with Russia is a question beyond my purpose here As for the special role of US intelligence elites † what I have termed Intelgate ù efforts are still underway to disclose it fully, and are still being thwarted A full explanation of the post Soviet Cold War choice would include the US political media establishment s needs † ideological, foreign policy, and budgetary, among others † for an enemy ù Or, with the Cold War having prevailed for more than half of US Russian relations during the century since 1917, maybe it was habitual Substantial meddling ù in the 2016 US election by Ukraine and Israel, to illustrate the point, did not become a political scandal In any event, once this approach to post Soviet Russia began, promoting it was not hard The legendary humorist Will Rogers quipped in the 1930s, Russia is a country that no matter what you say about it, it s true ù Back then, before the 40 year Cold War and nuclear weapons, the quip was funny, but no longer Whatever the full explanation, many of the consequences I have analyzed in War With Russia? continue to unfold, not a few unintended and unfavorable to America s real national interests Russia s turn away from the West, its pivot to China, ù is now widely acknowledged and embraced by leading Moscow policy thinkers Even European allies occasionally stand with Moscow against Washington The US backed Kiev government still covers up who was really behind the 2014 Maidan snipers massacre ù that brought it to power Mindless US sanctions have helped Putin to repatriate oligarchic assets abroad, at least $90 billion already in 2018 The mainstream media persist in distorting Putin s foreign policies into something that even the Soviet Unionnever dared to try ù And when an anonymous White House insiderexposedin theTimesthe amorality ù of President Trump, the only actual policy he or she singled out was on Russia I have focused enough on the demonizing of Putin † the Post even managed to characterize popular support for his substantial contribution to improving life in Moscow as a deal with the devil ù † but it is important to note that this derangement is far from worldwide Even aPostcorrespondentconcededthat the Putin brand has captivated anti establishment and anti American politicians all over the world ù A British journalistconfirmedthat, as a result, many countries in the world now look for a reinsurance policy with Russia ùAnd an American journalist living in Moscowreportedthat the ceaseless demonization of Putin personally has in fact sanctified him, turned him into the Patron Saint of Russia ù Again, in light of all this, what can be done? Sentimentally, and with some historical precedents, we of democratic beliefs traditionally look to the people, ù to voters, to bring about change But foreign policy has long been the special prerogative of elites In order to change Cold War policy fundamentally, leaders are needed When the times beckon, they may emerge out of established, even deeply conservative, elites, as did unexpectedly the now pro d√©tente Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid 1980s But given the looming danger of war with Russia, is there time?

"16 Aug, 2018",Sanction Mania v Russia - by Stephen F. Cohen,"For nearly 100 years, Russia has been under US sanctions, often to the detriment of American national security Cohen begins by putting the current bipartisan Senate campaign to impose new, crushing sanctions on Russia in historical context Broadly understood, sanctions have been part of US policy toward Russia for much of the past 100 years During the Russian civil war of 1918 20, President Woodrow Wilson sent American troops to fight against the emerging Soviet government Though the Reds ù were clearly the established government of Soviet Russia by 1921, Washington continued to deny the USSR diplomatic recognition until President Franklin D Roosevelt established formal relations in 1933 During much of the 40 year Cold War, the United States imposed various sanctions on its superpower rival, mainly related to technological and military exports, along with periodic expulsions of diplomats and spies on both sides Congress major political contribution was the 1975 Jackson Vanik Amendment, which denied Moscow privileged trading status with the United States, primarily because of Kremlin restrictions on Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union Indicative of how mindlessly habitual US sanctions had become, Jackson Vanik was nullified only in late 2012, long after the end of the Soviet Union and after any restrictions on Jews leaving (or returning to) Russia Even more indicative, it was immediately replaced, in December 2012, by the Magnitsky Act, which purported to sanction individual Russian officials and oligarchs for human rights abuses The Magnitsky Act remains law, supplemented by additional sanctions leveled against Russia as a result of the 2014 Ukrainian crisis and particularly Moscow s annexation of Crimea Looking back over this long history, there is no evidence that any US sanctions ever significantly altered Moscow s behavior in ways that were intended Or that they adversely affected Russia s ruling political or financial elites Any pain inflicted fell on ordinary citizens, who nonetheless rallied patriotically around the Kremlin leadership, most recently around Russian President Vladimir Putin Historically, such sanctions were not problem solving measures advancing American national security but more akin to temper tantrums or road rage, making things even worse, than to real policymaking Why, then, Washington s new bout of sanction mania against Moscow, especially considering the harsh official Russian reaction expressed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who called the Senate s proposed measures a declaration of economic war and promised that the Kremlin would retaliate? One explanation is an underlying, astonishing assumption †recentlystated by Michael McFaul, the media ubiquitous former US ambassador to Moscow and a longtime Russia scholar: To advance almost all of our core national security and economic interests, the US does not need Russia Such a statement by a former or current policymaker and intellectual is perhaps unprecedented in modern times and manifestly wrong US core interests need Russia s cooperation in many vital ways They include avoiding nuclear war; preventing a new and more dangerous arms race; guarding against the proliferation of weapons and materials of mass destruction; coping with international terrorists (who are in pursuit of such materials); achieving lasting peace in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East; fostering prosperity and stability in Europe, of which Russia is a part; promoting better relations with the Islamic world, of which Russia is also a part; and avoiding a generation long confrontation with a formidable new alliance that already includes Russia, China, Iran, and other non NATO countries If McFaul s assumption is widespread in Washington, as it seems to be, we are living in truly unwise and perilous times A second assumption is no less myopic and dangerous: that the Kremlin is weak and lacks countermeasures to adopt against the new sanctions being advocated in Washington Consider, however, the following real possibilities Moscow could sell off its billions of dollars of US Treasury securities and begin trading with friendly nations in non dollar currencies, both of which it has already begun to do It could restrict, otherwise undermine, or even shut down many large US corporations long doing profitable business in Russia, among them Citibank, Cisco Systems, Apple, Microsoft, PepsiCo, McDonald s, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co , and even Boeing It could end titanium exports to the United States, which are vital to American civilian and military aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing And terminate the sale of rocket engines essential for NASA and US satellite operations The world s largest territorial country, Russia could charge US airlines higher tariffs for their regular use of its air space or ban them altogether, making them uncompetitive against other national carriers Politically, the Kremlin could end its own sanctions on Iran and North Korea, alleviating Washington s pressure on those governments And it could end the Russian supply transit to US troops fighting in Afghanistan used since the early 1990s None of this seems to have been considered by Washington s sanction zealots Nor have four other circumstances Sanctions against Russia s oligarchs actually help Putin, whom the US political media establishment so despises and constantly indicts For years, he has been trying to persuade many of the richest oligarchs to repatriate their offshore wealth to Russia Few did so Now, fearful of having their assets abroad frozen or seized by US measures, more and more are complying Second, new sanctions limiting Moscow s ability to borrow and finance investment at home will retard the country s still meager growth rate But the Kremlin coped after the 2014 sanctions and will do so again by turning away even more from the West and toward China and other non Western partners, and by developing its own capacity to produce sanctioned imports (Russian agricultural production, for example, has surged in recent years, now becoming a major export industry ) Third, already unhappy with existing economic sanctions against Russia, European multinational corporations † and thus Europe itself † may tilt even farther away from their capricious transatlantic partner in Washington, who is diminishing their vast market in the East And fourth, waging economic war is one impulsive step from breaking off all diplomatic relations with Russia, this too actually being discussed by Washington zealots Such a rupture would turn the clock back many decades, but in an era when there is no globalization, or international security, without Russia Finally, what reason do Washington extreme Cold Warriors themselves give for imposing new sanctions on Russia? Most of them are in the US Senate, historically a body with at least several independent minded distinguished statesmen, but no longer, with the apparently solitary exception of Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has demonstrated considerable wisdom in regard to US Russian relations Their professed reasons are various and nonsensical Some say Russia must be sanctioned for Ukraine, but those events happened four years ago and have already been punished Others say for Russia s aggression in Syria, but it was Putin s military intervention that destroyed the Islamic State s terrorist occupation of much of the country and ended its threat to take Damascus, to the benefit of America and its allies, including Europe and Israel Still others insist the Kremlin must be sanctioned for its nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK several months ago But the British government s case against the Kremlin has virtually fallen apart, as any attentive reader of articles inDavid Johnson s Russia Listwill understand Ultimately, though, the new bout of sanction mania is in response to Russia s alleged attack on American democracy during the 2016 presidential election In reality, there was no attack † no Pearl Harbor, no 9/11, no Russian parachuters descending on Washington † only the kind of meddling and interference in the other s domestic politics that both countries have practiced, almost ritualistically, for nearly a hundred years Indeed, whatever meddling Russian actors did in 2016 may well have been jaywalking compared to the Clinton administration s massive, highly intrusive political and financial intervention on behalf of the failing Russian President Boris Yeltsin s reelection campaign in 1996 We are left, then, with the real reason behind the new anti Russian sanctions effort: to thwart and even punish President Donald Trump for his policy of cooperation with Russia And Putin too for having met and cooperated with Trump at their Helsinki summit in July This bizarre, also unprecedented, reality is more than a whisper According to aNew York Times † news analysis, as well as other published reports, a bipartisan group of senators, dismayed that Mr Trump had not publicly confronted Mr Putin over Russia s election meddling, released draft legislation of new sanctions against Moscow Passage of such a bill would impose some of the most damaging sanctions yet Leave aside for now that it is not Russian meddling that is delegitimizing our elections but instead these fact free allegations themselves that are doing so (How many losing candidates in 2018 will claim their victory was snatched away by Putin?) Consider instead that for doing what every American president since Eisenhower has done meet with the sitting Kremlin leader in order to avoid stumbling into a war between the nuclear superpowers in effect both Trump and Putin are being condemned by the Washington establishment, including by members of Trump s own intelligence agencies If so, who will avert the prospect of war with Russia, a new Cuban missile like crisis, conceivably in the Baltic region, Ukraine, or Syria? Certainly not any leading representative of the Democratic Party Certainly not the current Russophobic bipartisan Senate Certainly not the most influential media outlets, which amplify the warmongering folly almost daily In this most existential regard, there is for now only, like it or not, President Donald Trump Stephen F Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US Russian Cold War Previous installments, now in their fifth year, are atTheNation com Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor of †The Nation This article was originallypublishedby The Nation Think your friends would be interested?

that, a group of American thinkers and writers with no obvious sympathies towards Russia, had their reputations attacked Some days later, Medium, which hosted the smear, took the piece down but the damage had been done Now, you d need a heart of stone to take satisfaction from the current Russia hysteria in the United States Because it s genuinely sad to see the political and media elite of a great country tear themselves apart over poltergeists that most rational people assumed had evaporated decades ago What s even more depressing is how the social media age, which promised a new dawn in expression and thought, is increasingly echoing the worst excesses of the 1950s: the period known as McCarthyism ù Except the new smear artists are arguably even more uncouth and opportunistic than their predecessors from those two tone times And they have less justification: Russia is no longer a closed country, hidden behind an iron curtain ù In fact, contemporary Americans, if they so desire, can pick up a visa and bounce around from St Petersburg to Vladivostok to their heart s content However, the spy hunters and disinformation warriors ù aren t interested in first hand experience, because their real motivation is to smear and silence the genuinely curious, who have invested the time and effort to acquire expertise And what s thoroughly depressing is that Molly McKew, John Schindler, Eric Garland, and their fellow travelers boast tremendous influence on Twitter and many also have platforms on mainstream media McKew, for instance, is a Politico columnist, whoappearson US national television and is frequentlycitedas an expert ù by the Washington Post A paper which also publishes Max Boot Indeed, only last week, he used its pages to ludicrouslyclaimTrump couldn t have won the 2016 US election without Russian assistance And, no, Boot didn t suggest Moscow had somehow convinced Hillary Clinton not to campaign in Wisconsin Meanwhile, Schindler is a familiar face toFoxandCNNviewers Last weekend presented a vivid example of how these charlatans operate, when they used their Twitter accounts to promote a subsequently deleted Medium ù post designed to defame Dustin Giebel, an American writer who focuses on Russia The diatribe, from one Jay McKenzie, appeared to be alleging that Giebel was some sort of Kremlin agent because he d regarded the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko as a mentor at college Yevtushenko, who died last year, had been a supporter of reformist Soviet and Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, who late in life, divided his time between Russia and the United States Well,@DustinGiebel s mentor certainly said so Conveniently, after RFK died https:// tdotco /QRqQODBoXt While the gotcha ù nonsense largely focused on attempting to trip up Giebel over old tweets (obviously uninterested in Edward de Bono s observation: If you never change your mind, why have one ù), it also took aim at buddies, online at least, of the writer Thus, Nina Jankowicz, a think tanker at the US government funded Wilson Center, and Michael Colborne, a Canadian journalist hardly noted for Kremlin sympathies, ended up in the crossfire And it all seemed to be inspired by the shockingrevelationthat Giebel intended to take his wife to Moscow this June, during the World Cup, which was taken as clear evidence of his comprised credentials Giebel later alleged that the fallout led to a threat against my two year old daughter from one of your loony s (sic) so your cosplay and doxxing was a success Thank Molly McKew and John for this, the great

TV fixture John Sipher had shared the smear job And they were joined by Moscow born neoconservative activist Max Boot Sipher tried to backtrack with a bizarrestatement: This seems to be a fight over people s credentials We need to move past it Yes, we need the voices of serious academics We also need journalists, diplomats, practitioners, politicians and interested parties What Russia and Trump are doing is obvious and damaging ù But McKew was unrepentant, even after Jankowicz appealed to her directly Molly, I don t want anyone to say anything bad about you, but I d also prefer you did the same for me and didn t spread unfounded lies about me and my work, ù shewrote Our disagreements are intellectual, not personal Do you stand by James research conclusion that I m a Kremlin agent? ù A few days later, McKew hasn t replied Even though she s surely aware the article has been shut down Speaking of which, McKenzie wasn t deterred after it went dark The current Kremlin espionage offensive against the West bears [an] uncanny resemblance to the late 1940s, ù hetoldhis †28K followers They will deny until they can deny no more, right until the unpleasant truth finally comes out Read @20committee s (Schindler) latest and know our enemy ù Meanwhile, an anonymous userclaimedthe Kremlin itself had the article deleted Of course, in normal circumstances, Twitter spats between lobbyists, writers and activists wouldn t merit the op ed treatment But these are not regular times Viewed from Europe, the United States media, academic and political elites appear to be tearing themselves apart over issues with Russia, which are relatively minor and don t touch a nerve with the general populace And the standards of journalism right now are so low as to be almost beyond belief We have a situation where someone like Boot, alongside promoting fake slanders, is able to appear on CNN and allege Russia has attacked ù America, while the host, Anderson Cooper, doesn t even bother to challenge his views Not to mention how CNN itself regularly presents analysts who havenever even been to Russiaas experts ù on the country Stephen Cohen, professor of Russian Studies, spars with fellow panelist@MaxBoot, saying Trump carried out an act of diplomacy in Putin summit I think Mr Boot would have been happy if Trump had water boarded Putin at the summit and made him confess

However, while these chancers enjoy the limelight, genuine Russia specialists are ignored unless they are willing to betray reality and enthusiastically join in the madness The former ambassador Michael McFaul is a case in point This is all very sad, worrying, troublesome and dangerous Legitimate, sincere, inquisitive and equitable voices tossed to the margins, and defamed, while spoofers,

ùwas promptly interpreted as a sign of resistance and an omen that he could soon be fired so much so, that Coats later had toexplainhimself, admitting his reaction was awkward, ùbut no disrespect was implied Browder, who resides in the US and deems himself a personal enemy of Putin, was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum this week along with numerous other adherents of the Russiagate Among other things, Browder accused Republican Dana Rohrabacher of being on the payroll of Russia, ùbecause of his lobbying to overturn the Magnitsky Act a piece of legislation that led to sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights violations It began with Browder s accusations against Moscow over the death of a member of his staff in a Russian jail READ MORE: Accused fraudster Browder claims GOP Congressman Rohrabacher is on Russia s payroll Faced with a request for evidence, Browder downplayed the accusation, saying he didn t really mean Rohrabacher was a full blown Russian agent, just under some type of influence by the Russian government ùIn any case, Browder didn t have the bank transfers to prove it ù Detained late last week in the US, Russian student and gun rights activist Maria Butina has been charged with being an unregistered Russian agent on American soil The prosecution s claims include her using sex to get into a position of influence with Republican officials Russia believes the arrest is a political stunt, especially considering it was timed to the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin, while charges against Butina have been fabricated Russian Foreign Ministry expresses support for citizen jailed in US, and suddenly it s war https:// tdotco /1Mkw7ITrqo@mfa_russia#FreeMariaButinapic twitter com/cR9LM5QZkO The Russian Foreign Ministry s attempt to defend Butina online with a hashtag and a user pic change wasmetwith a torrent of mockery, expletives and puns from the US establishment s digital conscripts One award winning journalist went as far as equating the Foreign Ministry s support campaign to a declaration of war She clarified she had meant a troll war, ùbut that didn t spare her a few reminders by concerned commentators of what a real war actually looks like ",https://www.rt.com/usa/433963-russophobia-us-russia-scare/

He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Considering the unmistakable Liberal bent of the US mainstream media complex, which churns out anti Trump, anti Russia stories with more predictable homogeneity than a Pringles potato chip factory, the chances of the Putin Trump summit winning any positive reviews back home was about slim to none And, as if to worsen those dismal odds even more, US Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, with timing so uncanny it could only have been premeditated,announcedindictments against 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their alleged involvement in hacking the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) That bombshell, coming just days before the opening of the summit, appears to have knocked President Donald Trump off his horse in Helsinki, forcing him into a defensive posture The reason is obvious: any talk of Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election works to delegitimize his presidency In other words, according to the Russiagaters, it was not due to the democratic will of the American people that Trump secured a historic victory, but rather some Russian Facebook and Twitter ads Putin, however, whose political fortunes are not swinging in the breeze of an intensely partisan witch hunt on the domestic front, offered to meet US officials halfway ùin an effort to close the Russiagate case once and for all Pointing to the 1999agreementbetween the US and Russia, entitled, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Putin reminded US officials that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is entitled to send a formal request to have those Russian citizens facing charges in the United States undergo questioning by the Russian authorities He even offered to allow American officials to be present in Russia during the interrogation ùprocess We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr Mueller, we can lead them into the country and they will be present at this questioning, ùthe Russian leader said The second part of Putin s offer came with a quid pro quo Putin proposed that US authorities reciprocate and interrogate particular American citizens whom the Kremlin suspects of having engaged in illegal activities in Russia And, as with the indicted Russians, the questioning of the Americans would take place in the presence of Russian officials Trump hailed Putin s idea as an incredible offer, ùwhile at least one of his perennial critics back homeslammedthe President s comments as treasonous Putin went on to specifically mention a criminal case involving Bill Browder, a British investor who wassentencedin absentia to nine years in prison on fraud and tax evasion charges by a Russian court in 2017 Putin confirmed Browder earned over $1 5 billion in Russia ù tax free They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor the United States, and yet the money escaped the country, ùthe Russian leader noted They were transferred to the United States ù Putin then made an explosive revelation, alleging that, of the money funneled out of Russia, a huge sum was donated by Browder s associates as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton ùWhile admitting that the contribution in the exorbitant US political system might have been legal, ùthe Russian leader emphasized that the way the money was earned was illegal ù Browder, who is currently living in England, branded the accusations ludicrous ù In reaction to Putin s proposal, the howls of protest came fast and furious One of the most vocal opponents was Michael McFaul, who served as US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 under the Obama administration McFaul, the first non career diplomat to serve in such a capacity, is not entirely detached from the US born British businessman In May 2018, for example, when Browder was arrested in Madrid on a Russian arrest warrant, he called for Russia to be expelled from Interpol ù Russian needs to be excluded from Interpol https:// tdotco /xKFZdF6HzS The career academic, clearlyunnervedby the prospect of being interrogated in the presence of Russian officials, requested information from the White House press pool in one of many Twitter posts devoted to the subject Hey WH press Corps, can you confirm tomorrow with@PressSecthat Putin discussed me personally in his one on one with Trump? Did he suggest that I was part of some alleged money laundering scheme? And did Trump push back on this completely invented , whacko idea? But is it really so whacko ùabout having some high ranking government officials, even former diplomats who worked under the aegis of immunity, answer questions about an ongoing investigation? Indeed, Mueller should view Putin s offer as a golden opportunity to sit down with the indicted Russians and present the case against them, complete with all of the necessary evidence At the same time, it would allow the accused Russians to have an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges, since the possibility of doing so in the United States, given the current political climate, would be impossible All things considered, Putin s proposal provided all the necessary elements for a fair and unbiased case against the accused However, the fact that Trump won t be able to implement such a plan due to the extreme acrimony back home much of it pure hyperbole seems to indicate that Putin called Mueller s bluff After all, if there was any ironclad proof of Russian involvement in the hacking of the DNC servers, there would be no hesitation on the part of US officials to travel to Russia and present it Interesting how the spirit of transparency and openness seems attractive only when it works on behalf of a particular political agenda In any case, Putin may get a second chance to float his idea of a joint investigation with US leaders soon enough Even before Washington has had a chance to digest the Helsinki summit, Trump has alreadyinvitedPutin to the White House for more discussions in the fall Load up on the popcorn, the show has only just begun @Robert_Bridge ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/433793-putin-helsinki-interrogations-russiagate/

"19 Jul, 2018",US diplomats act like imperial governors riding roughshod over sovereignty of national governments,"On the world s Grand Chessboard, the US is fighting for control and influence And there are countries where its ambassadors are perceived more as imperial governors than simple channels of communication At the height of the Maidan protests in Kiev in early 2014, a conversation was leaked between the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, and the then Assistant Secretary of State in the Obama administration, Victoria Nuland The conversation gained notoriety because Nuland said to Pyatt, F**k the EU and the recording was almost instantly available onYoutube More shocking than Nuland s bad language, however, was what the conversation was about The US government officials were discussing how to put their men into power in Ukraine which of the three then opposition factions would dominate, who would take the lead (Arseniy Yatsenyuk) and who would be excluded (Vladimir Klitschko) † At the time of this conversation, early February 2014, their enemy Viktor Yanukovych was still president The leaked recording proved that the US and its Kiev embassy were actively involved in a regime change operation The composition of the post Maidan government corresponded exactly with US plans What few people knew at the time was that such levels of control over the composition of foreign governments had become standard practice for US embassies all over the world As I could see on my very numerous travels around the Balkans in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the US ambassador was treated by the political class and the media in those countries not as the officially accredited representative of a foreign government but instead as an imperial governor whose pronunciamentos were more important than those of the national government This has been going on for decades, although the levels of control exercised by the United States increased as it rushed to fill the political vacuum created by the collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe after 1989 In earlier times, such control, especially regime change operations, had to be conducted either covertly, as with the overthrow of Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, in 1953, or by financing and arming an anti government militia, such as in Nicaragua and elsewhere in central and South America, or by encouraging the army itself, most famously in Chile in 1973 There is a huge body of literature on this vast subject (for the coup against Mosaddegh, see especially All the Shah s Men by Stephen Kinzer, 2003) and there is no possibility of denying that such operations took place Indeed, former CIA director, James Woolsey, recentlyadmittedthat they continue to this day Many of the ambassadors who engineered or attempted regime change operations in Eastern Europe and the former USSR had cut their teeth in Latin America in 1980s and 1990s One of them, Michael Kozak, former US ambassador to Belarus, even boasted in a letter to The Guardian in 2001 that he was doing the same thing in Minsk as he had done in Managua He wrote: As regards parallels between Nicaragua in 1989 90 and Belarus today, I plead guilty Our objective and to some degree methodology are the same Kozak did not mention that he also played a key role in the overthrow of General Noriega in Panama in 1989 but he is far from alone The experience accumulated by the Americans during the Cold War, including in major European countries like Italy where US interference was key to preventing Communist victories in elections, spawned a whole generation of Kermit Roosevelts (the architect of the coup against Mosaddegh) who have made their careers over decades in the State Department Some names, such as that of Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia who made no secret of his opposition to the president of the state to which he was accredited, will be familiar to RT readers Two years after the violent overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, which he helped coordinate, Geoffrey Pyatt was appointed US ambassador to Greece He remains in that post to this day which is why some are asking whether his hand might be behind last week s expulsion of Russian diplomats from Athens Greece and Russia have customarily had good relations but they differ on the Macedonian issue Now, the Greek government headed by the pseudo Euroskeptic Alexis Tsipras, claims that four Russian diplomats were engaged in covert operations in Greece to lobby against forcing Macedonia to change its official name READ MORE: Macedonian MPs ratify Greece name deal again Like almost every other political issue these days, this relatively arcane one is regarded through the distorting prism of alleged Russian interference : any decision which does not consolidate the power of American dominated supranational structures like the US or the EU is now routinely attributed to all pervasive Russian influence, as if all dissidents were foreign agents Western discussion of this subject now resembles the paranoia of the old Soviet regime, and of its satellites in Eastern Europe, which similarly attacked anti Communists for being fifth columnists the very phrase used by a prominent European politician last month to lambast all his enemies as Russian stooges Europe has a fifth column in its ranks: Putin s cheerleaders who want to destroy Europe & liberal democracy from within: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage, Orb√†n, Kaczynski, Salvini use Kremlin money & intel Like Farage s friend Arron Banks, who colluded w/ Russians to deliver#Brexit US influence is suspected in this case between Greece and Macedonia because the Americans are pushing to bring the whole of the Balkan peninsula under Western control † This has been policy for nearly thirty years at least since the Yugoslav wars led to a US brokered peace deal in Bosnia in 1995 In recent years the tempo has quickened, with the accession of Montenegro to NATO last year leaving only Macedonia and Serbia as missing pieces of the puzzle The Greek victory over the name of Macedonia removes the last obstacle to that country s accession to NATO and other Euro Atlantic structures like the EU and soon only Serbia will be left Will she last long? One of the most notorious anecdotes of the Second World War was told by Churchill While in Moscow in 1944, he and Stalin divided up Eastern Europe and the Balkans into spheres of influence, putting percentage figures to show the respective weight of the West and the USSR 10:90 in Greece, 50:50 Yugoslavia, 25:75 in Bulgaria, and so on Churchill recalls how this so called Percentages Agreement was concluded in a few minutes, and how he scribbled a note of their verbal agreement on a piece of paper which Stalin glanced at for a second and then ticked off Churchill wrote, It was all settled in no more time than it takes to set down Churchill then reflected that it might seem cynical to decide the fate of millions of people in such an offhand manner Later generations have generally agreed with his self criticism † Today s West would certainly never conclude such an agreement but not because of any squeamishness or lack of cynicism on its part Instead, the West, especially the US, could not conclude any agreement because in every case the only acceptable outcome would be 100% influence for itself That is what Geoffrey Pyatt and his colleagues spend their entire careers trying to achieve and, to a large extent, they succeed ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/433690-greece-ukraine-us-ambassadors/

"30 May, 2018",Who is responsible for the new US-Russian Cold War? - by Stephen Cohen,"Prof Stephen F Cohen argues that unwise US policies since the 1990s have been responsible for the new Cold War Former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul argues that Russia s leader since 2000, Putin, is to blame A discussion of the Stephen F Cohen Michael McFaul debate Stephen F Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US Russian Cold War (You can find †previous †installments †of these conversations, now in their fifth year, atTheNation com ) On May 9, at a public event jointly sponsored by Columbia University s Harriman Institute and NYU s Jordan Center for Advanced Russian Studies, Cohen and McFaul îa Stanford University professor and previously President Obama s top Russia adviser in the White House and then his ambassador to Moscow îdebated a crucial historical but also urgent contemporary subject: The New US Russian †Cold †War îWho Is to Blame? ùCohen argues that unwise American policies since the 1990s have been largely responsible McFaul, drawing on themes in his new book, From †Cold †War †to Hot Peace, argues that Russia s leader since 2000, Vladimir Putin, is to blame (A video of the full debate can be seenhere ) Batchelor plays several statements by Cohen and McFaul at the event, which he and Cohen discuss Among the main points made by Cohen are the following: î The new †Cold †War †has unfolded for more than twenty years without any substantive mainstream debate înot in elections, Congress, the media, think tanks, or universities In a democracy, such debates are the only way to challenge and change official policy As a result, Washington s unwise policies toward Moscow have been guided by the same underlying assumptions and principles since the 1990s This situation is dramatically unlike the †preceding †40 year †Cold War, when US policy was regularly debated both at high and grassroots levels from the 1960s through the 1980s And this lack of public debate is one reason why the new †Cold †War †is more dangerous than was its predecessor Therefore, Cohen emphasizes, if this event sets a precedent, inspires more such debates between representatives of fundamentally opposing American views, as he and McFaul are, there will be no loser only winners in the making of subsequent US policy toward Russia î Cohen locates the origins of the new †Cold †War †at the time when the †preceding †one was said to have ended The three leaders who declared that the †Cold War †had ended in 1989 ≠ ≠ ≠ 1990 îPresidents Gorbachev, Reagan, and George H W Bush îpublicly agreed it had been terminated through negotiations and without any losers ù But in 1992, Bush changed both the timing and terms of that epochal event, dating it from the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991, †two years later, and declaring: America won the †Cold †War ù Thus arose the US triumphalism and sense of entitlement that has informed Washington s policies toward post Soviet Russia ever since î At the same time, in 1990, another major agreement was successfully negotiated and then violated by Washington In return for Gorbachev s agreement that a reunited Germany (the political epicenter of that †Cold †War) would be a NATO member, the Western powers, led by President Bush, pledged that NATO would not expand one inch eastward ù † †Violating that pledge a few years later led to two primary causes of the new †Cold †War: today, NATO, the world s most powerful military alliance, is encamped on Russia s borders; and the Russian policy elite s abiding belief, expressed not only by Putin, that Washington has repeatedly broken its promises to, even deceived, ù Moscow î In the 1990s, the Clinton Administration s professed strategic partnership and friendship ù with Russia was in fact driven by rampant triumphalism With Russia gravely weakened and in profound crisis following the end of the Soviet Union, Clinton pursued what Cohen terms a winner take all ù approach to Moscow and, behind the scenes, toward Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself While the physically ailing and psychologically needy Yeltsin was being cajoled by Clinton on matters of Russia s domestic and foreign policies, legions of American advisers ù encamped across the country to similarly meddle ù in that nation s politics îdrafting laws and textbooks, abetting politicians and parties favored by Washington, and directly participating in the rigging of Yeltsin s 1996 reelection Many Americans applauded as progress the oligarchic plundering of Russia s richest assets, and some even enabled the transfer and laundering of that ill gained wealth in the West Then followed the onset of NATO expansion eastward and, in 1999, the US led bombing of Russia s traditional ally, Serbia, and NATO s annexation of its Kosovo province, which the Putin leadership would later cite as precedent for its action in Crimea All along, as Russia was afflicted by the worst ever peacetime economic depression, with some 75 percent of its people sinking into poverty and attendant social misery, Washington cheered the process as a transition to democracy and capitalism ù It ended in 1999, with Russia in financial collapse and with Yeltsin s resignation The resulting backlash could have been, Cohen points out, very much worse for the United States than Vladimir Putin has been î Despite the disastrous US policies of the 1990s, the winner take all approach continued under President George W Bush Thus, following the 9/11 attack on America in 2001, the new and not yet unchallengeable Russian President Putin gave more support to the US †war †against the Taliban in Afghanistan than did any other country, including NATO members Putin sought the real strategic partnership with Washington that Yeltsin had failed to achieve Instead, he got in return from Bush further NATO expansion, now headed to Russia s Baltic borders; expanded democracy promotion ù î meddling, ù to use Russiagate ù jargon îin Russia s internal affairs; and, most detrimental to Russian (and international) security, unilateral US withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty, which now has resulted in missile defense installments on land and sea very close to Russia and, predictably, a new nuclear arms race î In 2008, following an official NATO statement that one day the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine would certainly become members of the alliance, †a brief †war †between Russia and Georgia erupted An official European investigation concluded that Georgia s president had initiated the †war What is not known is whether he was advised to do so by his American patrons in the Bush Administration Whatever the case, Georgia was the first US Russian proxy †war †of the new †Cold †War Others, in effect, soon followed îin Ukraine, then in Syria More, or even worse, may be in the making î McFaul argues that Cohen s thesis of an unending triumphalist, winner take all ù approach to post Soviet Russia is wrong, as evidenced by President Obama s re set ù with Moscow under then President Dmitry Medvedev It was, according to McFaul (himself a major participant), a win win ù policy Cohen disagrees, pointing out in detail that Moscow was offered, and received, very little, while the Obama Administration got what it most wanted: Russian sanctions on Iran and an expanded Russian supply route to US and NATO forces in Afghanistan Moreover, it ended with another American broken promise In return for its partner ù Medvedev not vetoing at the UN Security Council the US led attack on Libya in 2011, Obama and his representatives, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,promisednot to seek the removal of Libya s leader, Muammar Gaddafi In the event, he was tracked down and killed Putin, then prime minister, remarked on yet another American deception ù And any chance Medvedev had for a second term as president, as the Obama administration hoped and even lobbied for, was crushed by his own re set ù partner in Washington î That is, McFaul and many others continue to insist that the new †Cold †War †and its causes began with Putin s return to the Russian presidency in 2012 But as Cohen s historical presentation shows, this is not a viable empirical or analytical understanding of past or current developments î Has the outcome really been a new †Cold †War? When Cohen first warned of this danger in the early 2000s, adumbrating his concern even during the Clinton Yelstin 1990s, it was widely said that a recapitulation of †Cold †War †was impossible for several reasons, primarily because there was no longer any fundamental ideological conflict between the United States and Russia, as there had been between democratic capitalism and Soviet Communism If nothing else, Cohen and McFaul agree there is now indeed an ideological clash between, it is said, the US led West s liberal democratic values and Putin s conservative, even reactionary, ones Cohen questions this †simplistic characterization of Putin s values, or ideology, but the issue was not directly joined and remains to be debated î A range of other disputed issues are discussed before the debate, and the Cohen Batchelor discussion, ends with the issue of Russiagate ù allegations regarding collusion ù between President Trump and Putin McFaul apparently regards the allegations as proven or nearly so Cohen does not, and he worries that if Trump is faced with an existential nuclear confrontation with Russia, as President John F Kennedy was during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, these allegations will prevent Trump from avoiding nuclear †war †through negotiations with the Kremlin, as Kennedy did McFaul did not comment on this, perhaps because the debate format did not provide him an opportunity to do so What he thinks about it is unclear But all of us, Cohen ends, should certainly, and urgently, think very carefully about this not improbable possibility Stephen F Cohen is a professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New York University †and †Princeton †University and a contributing editor ofThe Nation This article was originallypublishedby The Nation The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/428255-cold-war-cohen-mcfaul/
"23 May, 2018",Michael McFaul's memoir: Yesterday's man rages against the dying of the light," From Cold War to Hot Peace: 483 pages of a controversial former US ambassador to Moscow venting his agitation over unfulfilled potential Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv SAINT PETERSBURG As Theresa May might say, it s highly likely ù that Michael McFaul, given he s a professional scholar, is familiar with the work of George Berkeley For the uninitiated, or those who couldn t care less, he was a philosopher from Kilkenny, Ireland, famous for advancing a theory now known as subjective idealism ù Whether he knows it or not, McFaul has spent decades channeling Berkeley, except he s substituted the Irishman s mystic optimism for a messianic devotion to his own higher calling: ù that of democracy promotion ù Yet, in reality, the former US ambassador to Russia has mostly indulged in pretty selective idealism McFaul isn t interested in just any form of democracy: he only considers those which mimic the American liberal system legitimate Thus, just as the late bishop of Cloyne couldn t imagine a world without the presence of God, our hero can t envisage a planet where the United States is not calling the shots everywhere However, McFaul is offering readers a romanticized version of the American order, a system which often sees its custodians behave in the manner of a compromised preacher exulting his flock to do as he suggests rather than what his church does in practice And that s where Berkeley s most famous observation, esse est percipi (to be is to perceived), comes into play Because, make no mistake, either the ex ambassador genuinely lacks the self awareness to understand why he is so poorly regarded in Moscow, or he s playing what the English would call silly buggers ù Meaning the question is which Peter Sellers character McFaul most resembles: Chauncey Gardner (Being There) or Inspector Clouseau (The Pink Panther) And it s clearly the latter because this author is far more inept and incompetent than naive or stupid McFaul s academic speciality encompasses transitions from authoritarianism to democracy An early supporter of pro Western post Soviet Russia, he s angry with Vladimir Putin for ending the country s transformation towards an orientation subservient to Washington One assumes this is why he wrote a 52 pagepaper, in 2005, entitled American Efforts at Promoting Regime Change in the Soviet Union and then Russia: Lessons Learned Something which he omits from his book Now, arriving in Moscow with this sort of legacy pretty much amounts to turning up in Pamplona and waving red rags at the local bull population READ MORE:America s elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world This is especially so given McFaul arrived in the capital in January 2012, in the midst of large liberal opposition protests and just about two months after his old boss, HillaryClinton, had appeared to encourage the demonstrators, drawing a furious response from Putin Of course, McFaul could have tried to distance himself from what was happening but, instead, he devoted hisfirst meetingas ambassador to Putin s opponents which surely didn t impress the Kremlin Here, he indicates how he actually wasn t in favor of the event, claiming it was US Assistant Secretary William Burn s idea And this may be true, but surely McFaul could have feigned a flu to avoid it, if he really wanted, knowing the potential optics? Soon after this faux pas, Mikhail Leontiev, a Russian TV host, ran a flagrant attack on McFaul, which certainly smeared him and was absolutely factually challenged The author chastises Leontiev for building up anti American hysteria, but his argument is diluted now he s happy to appear, as a fixture, on Rachel Maddow s MSNBC show, which does the same thing in reverse whipping up anti Russian sentiment, using dodgy facts Furthermore, despite his protestations, McFaul betrays his interests when, later in his book, he considers taking a democracy promotion ù gig focused on the Middle East It suggests he s an ideologue who chose Russia as his chariot due to the circumstances of his time, rather than being a hardcore Russophile This theory is bolstered after he admits that the type of Russians who interest him come from a small circle (referring to Moscow in 1985): I met refuseniks, black marketeers, the spoiled children of Communist Party leaders ù There s nothing about heading into the regions and engaging with middle Russia, ù which tends to be conservative and sceptical of change but also elects the country s leaders Indeed, early on, he uses variations of the word democratic ù 13 times in one single paragraph which is notable for its disregard for the conventions of word repetition but also speaks volumes about the priorities at play especially given it s paired with the phrase righteous struggle ù For this reason I was expecting at least a chapter on the events of 1993 when Boris Yeltsin destroyed Russia s nascent democracy and created the hyper presidential ù system which has made Putin so powerful Back then, Yeltsinshelledhis own parliament with tanks, in defiance of democratic norms, and 158 people died (130 of them civilians) Instead of scrutinizing the effects of those actions, McFaul devotes a few paragraphs, concluding how everyone made mistakes and everyone lost ù Presumably, he felt he couldn t delve into it because Bill Clinton explained to the American people ù that Yeltsin was on the right side of history ù More delusive meandering comes when McFaul admits how, in 1994, after Yeltsin unilaterally invaded though the idea of invading part of your own country seems a bit bizarre Chechnya, he himself lectured Russians on national TV about how decisions to go to war are made in the US the President (must) consult with Congress before taking military action ù This is surely news to Donald Trump, who has twice attacked Syria (illegally) without consulting either chamber of Washington s bicameral legislature Then there s the 1996 Russian election, when American advisors meddled to assist Yeltsin s victory: something later celebrated in aHollywood movieand an iconic Time magazinecover But McFaul doesn t feel it merits comment, despite his almost daily protestations on US network TV about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential contest That said, there is some valuable information in From Cold War to Hot Peace such as the author s insider accounts of Putin Obama meetings His revelation that Putin insisted Dmitry (Medvedev) ù was in charge of foreign policy, during his presidency, is interesting in the context of the latter s later acquiescence to the West s 2011 Libyan intervention seen as a colossal mistake inside Russia Indeed, McFaul does acknowledge how American manipulation of Medvedev over Libya ended all hopes of him challenging for a second term in the Kremlin Another stand out observation is the description of Putin s 2007 Munich speech, where he lashed out at Washington s attempts to create a unipolar world, as shocking ù and infamous ù However, the most interesting revelation is that the Americans offered Putin a White House visit in May 2012, before the G8 summit, which took place in Maryland But he refused, and also avoided the main event: for reasons McFaul deems spurious This is noteworthy because it suggests Putin had already given up on Russia s integration with the West about two years before it was commonly realized And it also means Russia s 2014 suspension ù from the G8 wasn t much of a punishment at all Something Foreign Minister SergeyLavrovhas already intimated I was very cautious about reviewing this book because oddly for a man with Celtic blood McFaul is a sensitive soul So, in the interests of disclosure, I need to explain how he has blocked me on Twitter, apparently, because Idescribedhim as arguably, the least successful US ambassador to Russia in history ù in an exchange with a Russian journalist, something I d hardly consider a controversial statement As a result, I had decided not to review the book until McFaul popped up with a Marchtweetto RT †saying he couldn t wait for your reviews ù Well, now he need linger no more From Cold War To Hot Peace is widely available, both online and in bookstores Like this story?

The discussion jumps out of the gates with a jaw dropping assertion by Deadline host Nicolle Wallace Opening with a nostalgic look back at the Obama era, a period that radiates in the rear view mirror of the Democratic bandwagon like some sort of golden age, Wallace says Barack Obama didn t have a network distorting the truth for it Donald Trump does ùThat comment is not entirely bogus, however, since Obama didn t have a network ùlending gratuitous assistance to his liberal cause, but rather a multitude of liberal US mainstream networks But I digress Jim Rutenberg, a former columnist with the New York Times, provided a breakdown on McFaul s comments that was very instructive in terms of understanding how deeply embedded the notion of American exceptionalism has become among establishment figures There is some truth to the fact that the United States has engaged in election meddling over its history, the CIA has, ùRutenberg admits, before going wildly off the rails But what Ambassador McFaul was on to is that it s not always the same thing, right? Here you can help a democratic movement deal with a despot ù At this point, Wallace cut off Rutenberg by providing a glaring non example of US meddling in foreign states that was so outrageous it had to be scripted Right, sometimes it s standing up for Iranian dissidents who are being hung from cranes for being gay; America s role in supporting democracies is stated US policy I m not sure of any sort of embrace or national interest in permitting Russia to intervene in our democratic process ù At this point, I must defer to journalist Glenn Greenwald and his critique of this media madness in action Oh my god This is an actual, full discussion on MSNBC about how it s totally different when the US interferes in elections and other countries politics because we only do it to help bolster democracy & fight despots Did these people ever move beyond 4th grade US history?

Are we to assume from this statement that regime changes in Iraq, Libya, Ukraine & Syria don t qualify as meddling ? McFaul had a ready answer albeit, shall we say, a peculiar one Apparently, bombings and military invasions don t count as meddling and are thus irrelevant to the debate Correct The US invaded Iraq, bombed Libya, intervened militarily & gave military assistance to Syrians Meddling is not the right word Ukraine a very different story of US assistance to NGOs https:// tdotco /SmltrobAiM That last bit about Ukraine and NGOs was a bit of an approximation, too, considering how quick American officials were to get in touch with the Ukrainian opposition as the Euromaidan uprising that unseated pro Russian president Yanukovich unfolded in Kiev Accompanied by US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland rushed to Maidan Square to hand out sandwiches and talk to the protest leaders A few weeks later, Nuland was all smiles with the now splintered group that would soon come to power on the back of the Euromaidan rallies The man on the left in that last picture is Oleg Tyagnibok, the leader of Svoboda, a party with a militant nationalistic streak Like the rest of this argument, it s probably a matter of semantics, whether the words orchestrate ù and coup ù are too strong here No, the US did not orchestrate a coup in Ukraine That is simply not true https:// tdotco /jgiOlsDACh McFaul himself, together with an assistant state secretary, met with the Russian opposition at the beginning of his tenure in Moscow The meeting came at the height of a protest movement, soon after the large scale rallies in Moscow s Bolotnaya Square and Sakharov Avenue, which have since become iconic with the opposition Had this been modern times, would the word collusion ù have been appropriate?

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// tdotco /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director

figure annual sum This, of course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don t agree with their government s policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad s government as well as Iranian and Russian influence pic twitter com/nmSTkSzb5G Who are its people?Kimberly Kagan is the brains behind this operation She s married to Frederick Kagan, who was involved in the neocon Project for the New

Kiev s 2014 EuroMaidan coup She previously worked for the Kiev Post, a resolutely anti Russian newspaper which promotes US interests in Ukraine However, IFTSOW s most notorious lobbyist was Elizabeth O Bagy, who emerged as a Syria expert in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain O Bagy has alsocollaboratedwith the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which is further evidence of how tight knit the world of US neoconservative advocacy really is Who

"5 Dec, 2017","After Tuesday‚Äôs rumble in Kiev, Western media‚Äôs lack of interest is ominous for Saakashvili","Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko s attempt to frame his political opponent Mikhail Saakashvili as a Kremlin agent is truly beyond parody However, the refusal of most prominent western media outlets to cover the breaking story from Kiev spells danger for Mischa As I write, on Tuesday afternoon, the dramatic events are completely absent from the front pages of America s CNN, New York Times, and Washington Post This stands in contrast to their often hysterical live coverage of far less dramatic protests by Russia s small liberal opposition There s not a single word about Ukraine s attempted arrest of opposition figure@SaakashviliMon the front pages of@CNN,@BBCNews@washingtonpostor@nytimes But when Alexei Navalny holds small rallies in Russia, it s usually their main headlinepic twitter com/E3lGoE5A0A When Aleksey Navalny stages, relatively poorly attended, rallies in Moscow, the breathless reportage gives consumers of western media the impression that the activist is far more significant than he really is in Russia Yet, as Mikhail Saakashvili (incidentally also polling at around 2 per cent support nationally in his adopted country) leads thousands of angry demonstrators around the streets of Kiev, the same outlets turn a blind eye By doing so, they expose how closely their world news coverage matches the foreign policy objectives of the US government Because while Vladimir Putin s administration is despised by the London and Washington establishments, Petro Poroshenko s Ukrainian regime is supported by Whitehall and the State Department Thus, the Kiev authorities are covered in an entirely different way to their Moscow counterparts And their full throttle clampdown on dissent (from banning the Communist Party to imprisoning journalists) is soft soaped Meanwhile, any missteps in Russia are greeted with hysteria Nevertheless, Tuesday s events place many mainstream media editors in a bit of a pickle Because readers with an interest in the former Soviet space, will recognise that Saakashvili has long

Saakhashvili led the 2003 colour revolution in his homeland, which deposed the then president Eduard Shevardnadze But, following his victory in the 2004 Georgian election, he soon aped many of the negative traits of his predecessor, brutally clamping down on protestors and misusing state funds Four years later, Saakashvili led his country intoa disastrous invasionof South Ossetia, which drew Tbilisi into a brief conflict with Moscow That was the beginning of the end for † Mischa †in Tblisi, and today he s wanted on criminal charges in Georgia, accused of exceeding state powers ùduring a 2007 crackdown on the opposition and embezzling budget revenues Ukraine offered Saakashvili a way out of his legal problems back home and he re surfaced in Kiev, as a staunch supporter of the Euromaidan ù movements Some time after the western backed activists managed to overthrow the government in an illegal coup, he claimed Ukrainian citizenship and Poroshenko appointed his then ally, as governor of the strategically vital Odessa Oblast However, the relationship between the two men swiftly deteriorated Saakashvili, had apparently learned from his mistakes in Georgia and genuinely seemed to want to bring reforms to Ukraine But, in Poroshenko, he faced a cynical Oligarch with no intention of killing the Golden Goose, which enables himself and his allies to enrich themselves at their country s expense READ MORE: Cut off tentacles & go after the big head : Saakashvili calls for power grab in Kiev This culminated in Poroshenko stripping Saakashvili of his citizenship earlier this year, which rendered him stateless The Georgian returned to Kiev and today s stitch up was a disastrous attempt by the president to finally remove his opponent from the political fray Ukraine s general prosecutor claims that Saakashvili s activities in Ukraine are being funded by close associates of deposed leader Viktor Yanukovich, who is in exile in Russia An idea so laughable that even the likes of †Carl Bildt †and †Michael McFaul †dismissed it Tuesday afternoon Trying to arrest Saakhasvili on the pretext that he s some sort of Russian agent looks extremely amateurish Who will

has saved him from justice in Tbilisi Yet, his moves in Ukraine represent a huge gamble Because the Poroshenko regime serves the west s interests and London, Washington and Brussels have so far

than any equivalent Trump Russia collusion Both pale in comparison to Washington s meddling in the former USSR But the US media focuses on the most illusory of the situations Bryan MacDonald is an

Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv It s pretty obvious Donald Trump Jr isn t the brightest light in the firmament The lethargic, spoiled and languid persona he projects doesn t help either Nevertheless, the current hysteria surrounding his meeting a small time Russian lawyer is beyond any bounds of reason Especially coming from journalists who have surely met a dodgy source or two in their time, in the hope of a scoop Natalia Veselnitskaya was almost certainly not representing the Kremlin when she courted baby Trump Rather she waslobbyingon behalf of a client, mixed up in the Sergei Magnitsky case To that end, the ex UK tabloid hack Robert Goldstoneexaggeratedher usefulness to attract Donald Jr s attention By Trump s own account, he quickly sussed this distorted pretext and pulled back Plus, it s worth mentioning how she s also engaged plenty ofDemocratsas part of her campaign Nevertheless, certain media elements have been guilty of greater inflation than Veselnitskaya Including theNew York Times, which laughably labeled her a fearsome Moscow insider, ùwithout explaining how it was Moscow Oblast, not Moscow city, where she enjoyed this clout Because despite the shared name, the region and the metropolis are two different entities, roughly analogous to the relationship between Virginia and Washington DC Thus, the Times misleading headline was much the same as a Russian outlet hailing a Richmond based attorney as some kind of White House specialist There is another thing which makes this endless Trump Russia delirium even more dubious And that s how the US establishment will leap on any connection, no matter how vague, concerning the President s team and Russians, but ignores dealings between the Democratic Party and Ukraine The elephant in the room which has been almost completely ignored, and was amazingly not even mentioned when Petro Poroshenko visited Washington last month Let s be clear, Ukraine feared a Trump presidency Because, on the campaign trail, the candidate had openly suggestedrecognizingRussia s reabsorption of Crimea and spoke of the Donbass crisis as a problem for Europe, not America As a result, Kiev bet the house on Hillary Clinton And lost As Politicoreportedin January: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election And they helped Clinton s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers ù Now, this is pretty explosive stuff A credible American news organization is reporting how a foreign government directly interfered in the US election But the popular press didn t pursue the story Presumably, because its runs counter to the established narrative A Ukrainian American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort, and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation, ùthe piece continued The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia ù And here was the zinger: Politico s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections ù Later, Politicofocusedon the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American activist, who admitted acting as a link between Ukraine s Washington Embassy and the Democratic National Committee And also how Sergei Leshchenko, elected in 2014 as an MP for Poroshenko s party, had offered ledgers purportedly showing connections between Trump and Manafort before urging Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort ùIncidentally, Manafort has always been especially appalled at attempts to link his work to Russia, saying all my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West ù Leschenko wasn t coy about his intentions He openly admitted trying toexposeTrump as a pro Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world, ùby preferring Moscow to Ukraine Furthermore, as The Atlantic noted: the investigation into the payments listed in the ledger îwhich in April were partially corroborated by theAPthrough wire transfers that Manafort claimed were legitimate îmysteriously faded after the U S election, raising questions about whether Ukrainian officials aired concerns about Manafort less to root out corruption than to undermine the Trump campaign ù Overall, Democrat Ukraine collusion seems far deeper than anything so far proven between the Trump campaign and Russia For instance, Donald Jr stands exposed as having been willing to meet someone described as affiliated with the Kremlin to get information on Hillary, which was pretty dumb The meeting itself appeared to be a bait and switch so the lawyer could lobby on other matters However, the Ukraine story involved a concerted and deliberate campaign, including cooperation between Kiev representatives and the Clinton camp to research Trump Kremlin connections Thus, If the issue is collusion, it s obvious there was much greater connivance concerning Ukraine and the Democrats than a single exchange involving Donald Jr and an insignificant lawyer One where no information was actually provided That said, American outrage over meddling from Kiev and Moscow is laughable in the context of Washington s long history of interference in both countries politics In 1996, the US openly intervened in Russia s election to help Boris Yeltsin defeat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov And in 2011, Washington officials, including Clinton, publicly supported a protest campaign over disputed parliamentary elections The following year,Michael McFaularrived as ambassador to Moscow and unabashedly courted fringe opposition leaders in his very first event in the role In Ukraine, the interruptions have had even more serious consequences By the admission of Victoria Nuland, a member of the Obama administration, Washington spent over$5 billionon influence projects in the country The first regime change ùoperation came in 2004 and was known as the orangerevolution ùAnd in 2013, US politicians and officials, such as John McCain and Nuland herself, turned up in Kiev to encourage the Maidan movement, in which the USambassadorGeoffrey Pyatt was prominent That led to the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government, which divided the country and caused the separation of Crimea and a civil war in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions And it also contributed to an economic collapse which has seen the average Ukrainian salary fall to around $200 a month and led to unprecedented levels of emigration For sure, Ukrainians didn t hide their hostility toTrump Interior Minister Arsen Avakov deriding the eventual winner as a dangerous marginal ùanddescribinghim as a clown ùon Twitter Many Russians publicly slammed Clinton, which was hardly surprising after shecomparedVladimir Putin to Hitler The fact remains there is no evidence of a direct Kremlin campaign to undermine America s election The media has

"5 Jul, 2017",Putin & Trump finally meet: Here's why Russia and America can't get along,"So, at last, it s happening On Friday, almost six months after assuming office, Donald Trump will have his first meeting with Vladimir Putin Instead of a summit, it s snatched minutes on the G20 sidelines Testament to the current anti Russia hysteria in America Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv In January, at his maiden news conference as president, Trump mentioned seven times how it would be positive, ù good ùand even great ùif America couldget alongwith Russia ùAt the time, there was much bewilderment concerning his stances toward China, the European Union and the Arab World But on Russia, he was notably consistent He accepted the United States was partly to blame for dismal bilateral relations and insisted Washington would need Moscow s help to wipe out ISIS Since then, China s Xi Jinping, Britain s Theresa May, Germany s Angela Merkel, Japan s Shinzo Abe, among others, have visited the Oval Office and Trump will be in Paris later this month to meet Emmanuel Macron In addition, the president has visited Saudi Arabia and Israel and met all the NATO heads of state in Brussels But the toxic atmosphere in the US has restricted interaction with Putin to a few phone calls Because, in a climate where some pundits even ludicrouslyclaimthe president is a Kremlin agent, Trump knows a visit to Moscow would lead to a media frenzy And a Putin trip to the White House is almost unfathomable Thus, a lot is riding on a short man to man encounter in Hamburg This week, assorted Russia experts, ùwith varying degrees of entitlement to the designation, have been giving Trump advice ùbefore his touch down in Germany They ve included the likes ofIan Bremmer, Steven Pifer andMichael McFaul And some have made excellent points However, there s an overriding weakness to all their arguments; and that s the inability to see things from the Russian perspective Sadly, this is the persistent failure of American analysis of Russia Because Westerners get Russia wrong when they project their own values and priorities onto this country Instead, what they need to do is think like Russians And it means taking their hopes, fears and perspectives seriously and giving them equal weight Or otherwise, the net result is an endless cycle of recrimination and vitriol, which will continue to destabilize the world order Recently, Bruce Allyn of Harvard University, wrote an excellentop ed, introducing an updated version of the partisan perception chart, ùsomething designed to advance dialogue in confrontational relationships Quoting Abraham Lincoln, he wrote: ùI don t like that man I must get to know him better ùAnd suggested such an approach would be useful in US/Russian relations to to get to know the other side better, to allow both sides to air their grievances, challenge the other side, correct inaccuracies and then move beyond their emotionally charged, opposing positions to begin to address critical underlying interests ù Allyn outlined some basic disagreements between Moscow and Washington Here, I want to go further and include a few more And illustrate where the two powers are divided before Friday s Putin Trump chinwag RUSSIA:You are a military threat right on our border As seen from inside Russia, NATO s eastward expansion is aggressive It was bad enough bringing the Baltic states in, but attempting to add Georgia and Ukraine was the final straw And adding the likes of Montenegro is needlessly provocative This upset is also fueled by the historic memory of two great invasions of Russia those of Napoleon and Hitler coming from the European frontier AMERICA:You are a military threat to our European Allies Whereas Putin sees NATO s European members as vassals of America, Washington publicly considers them allies, who have freely joined the club Which certainly stacks up when it comes to political elites, if not the general populace in many of these countries The US justifies NATO s mission as guaranteeing stability in Europe and sees Moscow as a danger in this regard However, Trump s personal commitment to NATO is less than clear He previously described it as obsolete, ùbefore appearing to backtrack, albeit halfheartedly RUSSIA:You are a strategic nuclear threat to us AMERICA:You are a strategic nuclear threat to us This is pretty self explanatory Both countries are capable of reducing the other to radioactive ash RUSSIA:You are backing the wrong side in Syria The Kremlin believes the only stable solution for Syria is an intact state, ruled from Damascus And helmed by Bashar Assad, at least in the short term It considers the jihadi groups the Pentagon has backed to be terrorists ùand believes if they take power it will lead to a Libya style situation with a collapsed state A perfect scenario for ISIS to thrive Moscow also has real domestic security concerns related to radical Islamist terrorism AMERICA:You are backing the wrong side in Syria Under Barack Obama, the White House maintained that Assad must go ùAnd the foreign policy establishment in Washington still pushes this agenda Nevertheless, Trump himself is a wild card He has openly prioritized the destruction of ISIS Yet, his administration has attacked the same Assad forces which are fighting the terrorist group RUSSIA:You have interfered in our elections and domestic politics American meddling in Russian governance is a matter of record In 1993, Washington supported Boris Yeltsin when he forced a rigged referendum on a super presidential ùconstitution And in 1996, America helped him to defeat opposition leader Gennady Zyuganov, even sending advisers Of course, a blind eye was shown to electoral violations, such as 110 percent turnouts in remote districts Since Putin won power, US officials have displayed a clear preference for the small liberal opposition And the KremlinbelievesHillary Clinton personally encouraged 2011 protests against the results of a parliamentary election AMERICA:You have interfered in our elections and domestic politics Despite a lack of tangible evidence, almost the entire US establishment believes Moscow played a part in directing the 2016 presidential election According to Wikipedia: a January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership preferred presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an influencecampaign to harm Clinton s electoral chances and undermine public faith in the US democratic process Nevertheless, the Kremlin denies these charges and points to the absence of any proof RUSSIA:You bombard the media space with anti Russian propaganda English speaking Russians frequently complain the country they see described in Western media bares little resemblance to the one they live in And it s fair to say there is a lack of balance in mainstream press reportage from Russia A hive mentality amongst Anglophone journalists in Moscow, further amplified by the rise of Twitter and Facebook, doesn t help either AMERICA:You bombard the media space with anti Western propaganda A few years ago, the US think tank racket began to promote the notion of Russian news outlets (basically RT and Sputnik) undermining the West That said, given RT and Sputnik are literally just two organizations, with comparatively tiny budgets, up against thousands promoting a pro American outlook, this does seem preposterous Of course, other issues are dividing the two countries For instance, Moscow s warm embrace of China, happening at the same time the European Union and America are becoming more vexatious, alarms many in Washington There are also mutual concerns about energy production and distribution, sanctions (which the Kremlin believes are being used to gain competitive advantages) and North Korea Putin and Trump will have to find some compromises to offer any hope of improving relations However, the McCarthy esque madness currently enveloping Washington and the US

As we have just seen in America, they don t seem to need to provide evidence for their findings to become accepted gospel truth these days In fact, this entire article is precisely based on the assumption of how the DNC hacks, many analysts believe, were just a skirmish in a larger war against Western institutions and alliances ù(to quote the intro) As we all know, there is no actual proof of Kremlin involvement in the DNC hacks Indeed, WikiLeaks itself hassaidthe Russian government was not its source And its envoyclaimedthat a disgusted ùwhistleblower was responsible NEW YORKER:In early January, two weeks before the Inauguration, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, released a declassified report concluding that Putin had ordered an influence campaign to harm Clinton s election prospects, fortify Donald Trump s, and undermine public faith in the US democratic process ù The declassified report provides more assertion than evidence Intelligence officers say that this was necessary to protect their information gathering methods Critics of the report had repeatedly noted that intelligence agencies, in the months before the Iraq War, endorsed faulty assessments concerning weapons of mass destruction But the intelligence community was deeply divided over the actual extent of Iraq s weapons development; the question of Russia s responsibility for cyberattacks in the 2016 election has produced no such tumult Seventeen federal intelligence agencies have agreed that Russia was responsible for the hacking REALITY:This is not entirely true As many others have pointed out, the NSA (i e , the agency most likely to know, because it can monitor communications) hasofferedonly moderate support NEW YORKER:Another Administration official said that, during the transfer of power, classified intelligence had shown multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russian representatives, but nothing that rose to the level of aiding or coordinating the interference with the election REALITY:Obama s team had much the same level of contacts In fact, his chief Russia hand, ùMcFaul, even visited Moscow during the 2008 transition to speak to Russian officials Was in October 2008, but yes, I did meet with Russian officials then (as I always had when visiting Moscow for previous 25 years)https:// tdotco /M4W1xUowvv And there was nothing wrong in what McFaul did For example, Bill Clinton spoint manon Russia and Eastern Europe was considered a source of intelligence information and classified as""a special unofficial contact""by SVR The man concerned, Strobe Talbot, correctlypointedout how it was an exaggeration of chats he had with the Russian ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov Additionally, Henry Kissinger has maintained intensive contacts with Moscow for decades Yet every recent American president has sought his advice And George W Bush s Russia expert, Elizabeth Jones, actuallygrew upin Moscow and attended local Russian schools NEW YORKER:Russian security concerns were hardly the only issue at stake with respect to the expansion of NATO; Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries in the region were now sovereign and wanted protection ¶ Putin, in his first few years in office, was relatively solicitous of the West He was the first foreign leader to call George W Bush after the destruction of the World Trade Center towers When he spoke at the Bundestag, later that month, he addressed its members in German, the language that he had spoken as a KGB agent in Dresden He even entertained the notion of Russian membership in NATO America s invasion of Iraq, which Putin opposed, marked a change in his thinking REALITY:Protection from what exactly? In the 1990 s, nobody was threatening anyone and Russia was both on its knees and desperately trying to join the Western fold, under the famously pro American Boris Yeltsin Indeed, as acknowledged by the magazine, during his early years in office, Putin continued the same posture, before becoming embittered by NATO expansion and the illegal Iraq War There have been countless academic articles, from genuine experts, backing up this view And even George Kennan, the most celebrated American Russia analyst of the twentieth century,agreed Thus, NATO s overreach eastwards has caused the exact problem that NATO purportedly exists to circumvent: insecurity in Europe In this sense, it was like employing a team of golden retrievers to clean up shredded canine hair Also, is it such a big surprise that the illegal invasion of a sovereign country, based on obviously false evidence, without a UN mandate, would affect the thinking of a government which regards its UN veto as an important defense tool? NEW YORKER:He (Putin) was alarmed by the Obama Administration s embrace of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt And he was infuriated by the US led assault on Muammar Qaddafi s regime REALITY:This is presented as something irrational, and comes without proper context However, given that Russia is home to around 20 million Muslims, and has a history of problems with Islamist terrorism, what s unusual about Putin being concerned about secular, stable (if obnoxious) regimes in the Middle East being replaced by (obviously even more obnoxious) radical Islamists? Also, he was infuriated about Qaddafi, because as mentioned earlier, the mandate the UN agreed to was for a no fly zone not a fully fledged NATO campaign of airstrikes, coordinated with the opposition POLL: Trump Administration More Trustworthy Than Media In fairness, not very hard to beat https:// tdotco /jmuciYXOPspic twitter com/vysRtei4xi NEW YORKER:Russian television, of course, covered the siege of Aleppo as an enlightened act of liberation, free of any brutality or abuses REALITY:Which is more or less exactly how American and British TV covered the liberation ù of Baghdad in 2003 Check out this extraordinaryreportfrom BBC s Andrew Marr Who later became the channel s political editor NEW YORKER:And yet Russian military planners and officials in the Kremlin regarded Georgia as a failure in the realm of international propaganda REALITY:It s not hard to see why Even to this day, US news outlets (and the aforementioned McFaul who definitely knows better) continue to insist that Russia attacked Georgia But in actual fact, the EU s independent investigation into the conflictruledthat Georgia started the war NEW YORKER:The United States, meanwhile, had its own notable cyberwar success In 2008, in tandem with Israeli intelligence, the US launched the first digital attack on another country s critical infrastructure, deploying a worm, ù known as Stuxnet, that was designed to cause centrifuges in Iran to spin out of control and thereby delay its nuclear development REALITY:This admitted act of aggression is given a sentence, but an incident in Estonia in 2007 (never proved to have been Russian state ordered) is highlighted over many paragraphs complete with quotes from the country s former President Toomas Ilves NEW YORKER:Obama s adviser Benjamin Rhodes said that Russia s aggressiveness had accelerated since the first demonstrations on Maidan Square, in Kiev When the history books are written, it will be said that a couple of weeks on the Maidan is where this went from being a Cold War style competition to a much bigger deal, ù he said Putin s unwillingness to abide by any norms began at that point It went from provocative to disrespectful of any international boundary ù REALITY:Even though they have 13,000 words to play with, our heroes never consider other aspects of Maidan Such as, was it normal for serving US and EU officials to turn up at the rallies and more or lessencourageprotestors to overthrow their democratically elected government? Indeed, it looked like the rock star style adulation went to their heads Furthermore, what authority did US official s Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt have tochoosethe subsequent regime in Kiev? NEW YORKER:Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany s foreign intelligence agency, has expressed concern that Russian hackers are also trying to disrupt the German political scene, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is standing for reelection as a stalwart supporter of NATO and the EU REALITY:German intelligence recently admitted that it foundno evidenceof Russian election hacking after insinuations of such activity was breathlessly carried by popular media last year Notably, the all clear ùgiven to Moscow was ignored by the same outlets Also, this whole premise is a bit illogical, seeing as the only realistic alternative to Merkel the SPD led by Martin Schultz is even more pro EU than her CDU party And Schultz himself has spent most of his adult life working in Brussels, home to both the EU and NATO NEW YORKER:While officials in the Obama Administration struggled with how to respond to the cyberattacks, it began to dawn on them that a torrent of fake news ù reports about Hillary Clinton was being generated in Russia and through social media REALITY:It s been proven the fake news ù was primarilygeneratedin America itself and inMacedonia Not Russia NEW YORKER:Russia s political hierarchy and official press greeted Trump s Inauguration with unreserved glee REALITY:Given Clinton s aggressive anti Russiarhetoric, during which she compared Putin to Adolf Hitler, why is this a surprise?

"17 Jan, 2017",Lost legacy: How Barack Obama deliberately destroyed the US-Russia relationship,"Since becoming the US Commander in Chief in 2008, Barack Obama charted a thinly veiled anti Russia course that many failed to anticipate or appreciate due to the media generated hype of hope and change ù that accompanied his rise to power Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Few modern leaders have entered the world stage with more fanfare than Barack Hussein Obama After George W Bush s eight year War on Terror tour, many were ready to believe America s first black president would throw the US juggernaut into reverse Indeed, so mesmerized was the global village with Obama, who never brokered so much as a used car deal, itnominatedhim for a Nobel Peace Prize after less than two weeks in office To understand the source of our enchantment, we have to rewind to January 2007, shortly before Obama s meteoric rise: The relationship between the US and Russia had just entered severe turbulence as the Bush administration, top heavy with vicious neocons, announced it would drop a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe, with missile silos in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic The system, Washington explained, was to guard Europe from a rogue missile strike, ostensibly from Iran, despite the fact that such a reckless move on the part of Tehran would have meant quick US assisted suicide Moscow was not fooled This was made clear on February 12, 2007 when Vladimir Putin delivered his now famousspeechat the Munich Security Conference The Russian leader warned the stony faced delegates assembled there: Plans to expand certain elements of the anti missile defense system to Europe cannot help but disturb us Who needs the next step of what would be, in this case, an inevitable arms race? I deeply doubt that Europeans themselves do ù Putin went on to slam the American hyperpower ùand its well trained NATO attack dog for pursuing a world of one master, one sovereign ùthat will spark an inevitable arms race ù Putin s reality check came about three decades too late to break Europe s heavy American chains, thereby proving the Stockholm syndrome the curious psychological condition when hostages develop a helpless attachment to their captors can affect entire nations and even continents as well Suffice it to recall, later in Obama s presidency, Europe s muted reaction when an idealistic young American, Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor turned whistleblower, handed over thousands of classified documents detailing a USsurveillance programthat spanned the entire planet Even Angela Merkel s private cell phone was considered fair game Yet the astonishing revelations did little to dampen Europe s commitment to the Obama administration s policies But all that was in the future In the meantime, the world held its breath at the abyss, placing its faith in the hope and change ùsnake oil an Illinois Senator named Barack Obama was peddling via teleprompter to a war weary world that was increasingly willing to believe just about anything When Barack Obama emerged victorious in America s 2008 game of thrones, there was a promising break in the storm clouds Experts consulted their battered almanacs and predicted brighter days ahead in the US Russia relationship Unfortunately, the geopolitical weathermen got it wrong Tragically wrong And it all began with an innocuous sounding plan the US Russia reset ù rolled out by the seemingly well intentioned Obama administration In March 2009, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met in Geneva, where Clinton presented her counterpart with a cute reset ù button to signal in the much anticipated dawn in bilateral relations Although the largely symbolic gesture made for a great photo op, the reset moment was beset with glitches from the very start Much to the apparent embarrassment of the attendees, the US State Department had misspelled the word reset on the thingamajig in the Russian version; instead of reset ùit spelled ominously and even prophetically overload ù Lavrov and Clinton laughed off the technicality, cracked a few jokes, and pressed the plunger, thereby committing both sides to a tragic farce Lavrov could not have predicted such a backfire, however, since it was difficult to expect nothing less than miracles from the affable black guy from Hawaii who spoke so eloquently about ridding the planet of nuclear weapons, heralding in an age of world peace, and all that In any case, Moscow had no other choice but to believe him A few months later, when Obamaannouncedhe was going to shelve ùthe missile defense plans of his hawkish predecessor, it appeared the US leader was truly the real deal The belligerent Bush years, it now appeared, was nothing but an historic anomaly, a forlorn figure in the rear view mirror; America had conquered its aggressive neocon alter ego after all Those happy sentiments lasted for about as long as it took to read that line Yes, Obama would shelve ùBush s ambitious missile defense plans, but, with a sleight of hand and a lot of flip flop, the deceptive Democrat unveiled his own jazzy surround system the sea based Aegis SM 3 interceptors and forward based radar, which turned out to be surprise, surprise every bit as lethal as the Bush variant The Obama administration, however, apparently forgot that while the rest of the world played checkers, the Russians preferred chess Robert Gates, then defense minister, acknowledged as much when he noted, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles, ùthe Washington Postreported This admission blew the cover off of Obama s greatest deception, the US Russia reset hoax So now the question was no longer: Would the United States shelve the missile defense system? But rather: Would it cooperate with Russia on the system, thus sparing Eastern Europe another arms race? The answer to that question should have been obvious After months ofwild goose chasesaround negotiating tables, Moscow understood that the Obama administration was simply bluffing in order to buy time In November 2011, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced the formal end of missile defense talks (and the implicit beginning of an arms race) In fact, the Obama administration the very same nice people who introduced the reset idea refused to even provide written assurances that the system would not pose a threat to Russia s ballistic missile force, thereby upsetting the regional strategic apple cart via GIPHY Medvedev said Russia would, among other immediate errands,deployIskander missiles in Kaliningrad, equip Russia s strategic ballistic missiles with advanced warheads that are impervious to the missile defense system, and deploy offensive weapon systems able to take out any part of the US missile defense system in Europe ù If any of these moves on the part of Russia could be considered aggressive, ùWashington had nobody but itself to blame Yet, the US has talked up the mythical threat of Russian aggression ùamong its NATO client states to such a feverish pitch that these governments could not refute the groundless charges without appearing to be disloyal to Washington In other words, NATO members are not allies of the United States by mutual consent, but rather allies by arm twisting compulsion This brings us to the most dangerous part of the Obama administration s double dealing: Moscow itself is beginning to feel threatened by what it views and rightly, I believe to be American aggression on anabolic steroids Here is what Putin had to say about the US missile defense system, which has just gone live in Romania: They say [the missile systems] are part of their defense capability, and are not offensive, that these systems are aimed at protecting them from aggression It s not true, ùthe Russian leadersaid The great danger ùis that the launchers can be used to fire US Tomahawk missiles in a matter of hours, ùPutin said Meanwhile, technological advances will only make the system increasingly more versatile and powerful And exactly where the magic tipping point is, when the defense system shifts the global strategic balance, nobody can say with certainty Putin acknowledged this, saying technologies are developing, and we know around what year the Americans will get a new missile, which will have a range not of 500 kilometers, but 1,000, and then even more and from that moment they will start threatening our nuclear capability ù This deadly threat to Russia s national security a threat the United States would never accept if the situation were reversed naturally places those nations hosting the US missile defense system square in Russia s cross hairs It also makes it highly unlikely that Moscow will concede to further nuclear missile cuts Only a fool would take a dagger over a sword while his opponent reaches for a bigger shield Indeed, not only did the double dealing on the missile defense system trigger another arms race, it has threatened the New START Treaty a nuclear arms reduction agreement signed into force by Medvedev and Obama on April 8, 2010 in Prague Here is where the deceitful nature of Obama s reset is clearly revealed: At the very same time the United States was building for itself a mighty shield in Eastern Europe, capable of neutralizing Russian ballistic missiles, it was also working to have Russia dramatically reduce its nuclear sword through New START Obviously, the United States can t have it both ways, but that doesn t mean it won t stop trying It is interesting to note that US President elect Donald Trump has just suggested that he would consider the possibility of ending the sanctions regime against Russia in return for dramatically reducing ùnuclear weapons They have sanctions on Russia î let s see if we can make some good deals with Russia For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, ùTrumptoldThe Independent Trump may be many things, but a fool he is not So he must certainly understand that those weapons are Russia s only viable protection against the US missile defense, which, as we ve said, could turn offensive in a matter of minutes Moscow, it would appear, is hardly in a position to negotiate on these weapons The full implications of Barack Obama s pure deception over the missile defense system proved that the so called reset ù or overload ù had been nothing but a ploy, a smoke and mirrors diversionary tactic, in the hope of lulling Russia into believing that Washington was sincere about turning a new page in US Russia relations It was not A heavy footnote that needs mentioning is that the key architect of the US Russia reset was Michael McFaul, whose research, according to his ownwebpage, focused on Russian electoral trends, post communist regime change, and American foreign policy ù Little surprise, then, that Moscow expressed serious reservations when Obama broke with diplomatic protocol and named the non career academic the esteemed doctor of regime change, thank you very much as US Ambassador to Russia in January 2012 Now, Moscow is alleging US diplomats have engaged in espionage in Russia and actively participated in the rallies staged by Russian opposition forces, as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovrevealedthis week In addition to spying, US Embassy diplomats have repeatedly been seen taking part in the rallies of opposition, anti government forces, unauthorized rallies, including times when they wore disguise Do the math yourselves, ùLavrov stated #Lavrov: US has increased efforts to recruit Russian diplomats in recent years LIVE NOWhttps://t co/cOq6cPjwfBhttps://t co/SPlTpHqxKYpic twitter com/nJoM5XGpep Clearly, the reset was doomed to failure from the start, not because of any lack of will, but rather because the Obama administration was committed to it never succeeding in the first place Fast forward to 2016, and it is no coincidence that we see more than just the US missile defense system on Russia s border The New Year is barely underway and already we have dozens of US tanks, equipment and thousands of US soldiers fanning out across Poland and the Baltic States for what promises to be a continuous rotation of American military force exactly the sort of provocation US planners need to keep the entire region believing in the myth of Russian aggression ùand NATO members cracking open their wallets to buy up more US made military hardware So where is that promise of cooperation Barack Obama made to Russia when he first entered office? It s in that same state of limbo where other famous Obama promises like shuttering Guantanamo Bay detention facility and working to bring about global peace are located: neither here nor there A big part of the explanation is that the neocons are still calling the shots in Washington Meanwhile, the US mainstream media continues to serve up heavy helpings of fake news with regards to Russia, like thisopening linefrom The Spectator, which says it all: Is the Russian president really crazy enough to launch a new wave of invasions, or is it all a clever bluff? ù The intelligent, well informed reader would immediately ask: What Russian invasions? ùAfter all, the only time Russia initiated a military operation against a sovereign state was in August 2008 after Georgian forces invaded Tskhinval, the capital of South Ossetia, killing 12 Russian peacekeepers that had been stationed there Although the Western mediaabsolvedthen Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili of any wrongdoing at the time, an independent European investigation quietlyconcludeda year later that Georgia was indeed responsible for the instigating the five day conflict Who could have predicted eight years ago that Barack Obama, the peace president, would turn out to be many times more belligerent than the war president George W Bush? As Obama s final year winds down, some incredible statistics are beginning to emerge that show how militaristic the United States has become under Obama From Albania to Uruguay, Algeria to Uzbekistan, America s most elite forces Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets among them were deployed to 138 countries in 2016, ùaccordingto figures supplied to TomDispatch by US Special Operations Command That figure is a surge of 130 percent since the gung ho days of the Bush administration In the very same year, the Obama administrationdroppedan estimated 26,171 bombs, with most of them falling on the people of Syria and Iraq US bombs also hit targets in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan That s seven Muslim countries by the way Reset or not, there is no way Russia would have just sat back and watched as the Obama administration storm trooped its way through the Middle East and beyond Considering these truly disturbing figures, it is clear that the US military and its commander in chief was out of control, drunk on absolute power, and wreaking mayhem around a punch drunk planet for the past eight years The data also goes far at explaining Washington s marked hostility to Russian efforts to lend its military assistance in Syria against the terrorists of Islamic State Although it was largely due to Russia s air campaign that places like Aleppo and Palmyra were eventually liberated, today the Obama administration pretends Russia did nothing of significance in Syria On the weekend, Ash soon to be relieved of his imperial command Carter, US Defense Secretary, actually had the gall to say that Russia forces have achieved virtually nothing ùin Syria Nothing that could have been considered treacherous, he could have added The irony of the comment is so heavy it practically drips off the page: When Russia remained on the sidelines of the Ukrainian civil war, refusing to get involved in the affairs of its neighbor, it was falsely accused in Western media of actually invading that country On the other hand, when Russia was invited to enter the territory of Syria by its president to fight against Islamic State, which it did with stunning results, it was said by Washington to have contributed nothing ùto the Syrian efforts All things considered, the reasons are obvious why the US Russia reset never worked from the beginning It was predetermined to fail from the outset because America due to its supreme arrogance and exceptionalism believes it has no need of allies or partnerships That conceit is the fatal flaw of every dying empire @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/373950-obamas-legacy-reset-putin-russia/

Not to mention Iran, where the Moscow aided atomic deal is widely considered the current administration s finest foreign policy achievement Plus, how comical anyway was referring to owner of the planet s pre eminent nuclear arsenal as a local actor? Then there s the idea of Russia not making anything Where does Obama think they got all those weapons we see on display in Syria?

"6 Oct, 2016",Lame duck Obama throws in the towel on Russia,"The last time relations between Washington and Moscow were this lousy, Madonna and Wham! were top of the charts and Soviet leaders were dying at an alarming rate Foreign policy has emulated 1985 s most famous movie and gone Back To The Future Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014

based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Barack Obama doesn t understand Russia This became completely obvious when hedeliveredprobably the most poorly judged insult any American President has ever uttered toward Moscow, dismissing the country as a regional power ù Now, you might think Ronald Reagan was pretty rude when he called the USSR an evil empire ù And it s doubtlessly true that many Russians and Ukrainians, Latvians and Georgians etc at the time were upset by the evil ù segment, but at least he balanced his insult by referring to Moscow s realm as an empire ù You see empires, no matter how nefarious, are strong, but regional powers ù are weak Thus, Obama using these two words was a colossal error of judgment Especially when you consider how he was taunting the only country on earth which is capable of inflicting real military damage on America For the record, headdedhow he perceived Russia to be acting not out of strength, but out of weakness ù Presumably, just to double down on the affront In the same way most Brits are proud of their Royal Family, the French are haughty about their food and Japanese puffed up by industrial might, Russians are appreciative of their country s power If Obama had received proper advice on how to handle Moscow he d never have made such a calamitous boo boo Especially when his statement was completely untrue, as subsequent Middle East events have demonstrated That said, however, the haplessperformanceof his former Ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, suggests he hired badly on the Russian front Now, with only a few months left in his Presidency, it appears Obama has finally given up on Moscow which seems to be an acceptance of how his Russia policy has gone up in smoke As a result, the outgoing President will almost certainly be handing his successor two completely unresolved conflicts as the aperitif for their time in office Those in Syria and Ukraine If Obama wanted to avoid this situation, and thereby achieve a more credible legacy, there are myriad things he could still do For instance, he might request a summit with Vladimir Putin to finally reach agreement on both matters And this, of course, is what previous occupants of the White House did when relations went sour Or he could even go further by calling full scale conferences on both, inviting all the stakeholders (although you d need an aircraft carrier to host all the contributors to the Syrian strife) But it appears Obama is too jaded to attempt to leave behind a clean record He d rather play golf and let poor John Kerry do all the donkey work Right now, relations between Moscow and Washington are at their lowest ebb since Konstantin Chernenko and Reagan occupied the two hot seats And it s worth noting how the former died in 1985 So, now that I ve highlighted the extent of the malaise, it s time to explain how bilateral engagement became so atrocious Obama evidently has an enormous ego And his arrogance toward Russia proves it He s assailed its economy, mocked Putin and completely refused to recognize Russian concerns in Eastern Europe Furthermore, he s even using Putin as a truncheon to batter Republican candidate DonaldTrumpin the current domestic election campaign This is bad diplomacy, at the very least Here s a sample Obamaquote: Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters ù This was in January 2015 and it s a new variant of a theme that s been doing the rounds since 1999 Back then Anders Aslund now a lobbyist at NATO s Atlantic Council adjunct predicted the country s imminent collapse in a Foreign Policy article which has become seminal As an example of how to be spectacularly wrong on Russia, that is Aslund, who gets away with his shtick to this day, is a prime example of somebody completely clueless on Russia who, bizarrely, is able to influence US policy makers And I reckon it s this sort of below par advice which explains why the Obama administration and the Bush government before it has been consistently wrong footed on the Russian question ù In Moscow, there are a number of theories doing the rounds to explain why Obama has apparently thrown in the towel Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov seems to believe the US President isnot fully in controlof his military and other elements in his government Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry s spokesperson, Maria Zakharovahas saidWashington † simply has no unified stance The reasons for this are maybe less complicated than they seem If it can be put remotely simply, both Washington and Moscow oppose ISIS However, America s allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ISIS s main supporters, which make things complicated The US views Islamist rebels (referred to as moderates in the Western media) as the country s future while Russia regards them as terrorists For its part, the White House believes the real aggressor is the Syrian government Which Russia contends is the only entity capable of keeping the state intact and defeating ISIS There are also myriad other vested interests to take into account, including Turkey, Iran, Israel, the Kurds and various others But let s not go there We also can t forget Ukraine, where things are a bit simpler Post Brexit and the Dutch referendum, there is no hope of Ukraine ever joining the EU Thus, aside from wanting the conflict contained, Germany, France and the UK have stepped back Even Sweden and Poland, who under previous regimes pushed for EU expansion eastwards, have disengaged As a result, it s now a straight conversation between Washington and Moscow The US desires a foothold in Kiev and Russia wants them out Obama s replacement will have to decide whether to up the ante or concede the issue It s also possible that internal Ukrainian concerns could intervene to change the dynamics After the State Department announced this week that it was suspending talks with Russia on Syria, the Kremlin saw the move and raised the stakes President Putin introduced a bill to the State Duma which proposes suspending a plutonium disposal agreement with the US, citing unfriendly actions ù by Washington In order to renew the deal, Moscow is seeking the cancellation of sanctions and the removal of US military installations from certain east European countries Perhaps Putin was responding to some very careless words by State s spokesman, John Kirby? The official spoke of new sanctions, ù terror attacks on Russia soil, ù troops in body bags ù and lost aircraft ù US words on attacks in Russia, body bags, downing jets sound like get em ù call Russian FM spoxhttps:// tdotco /r57MiSIDH2 Whatever the reason, it s clear Obama has given up on Putin and the Kremlin has replied by washing its hands of his administration The result is that for the next few months, the planet s two military superpowers won t be on speaking terms With Syria and Ukraine essentially proxy conflicts between the pair, this is not good Not to mention urgent issues like climate change, migration and the condition of the global economy, which require cooperation between all the world s strongest nations ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361830-obama-putin-russia-us-policy/

 positions are a reward for fundraising or, very occasionally, are
 granted to a high profile individual with connections to the

 wrapping, nor is it botany related; it s American terminology for
 an activist who pushes legal fundraising limits to their limits 
 Given the ridiculous expense of American democracy where
 Obama spent $1 1 billion on his 2008campaign these guys are invaluable Whereas
 a private citizen can only give $2,500 to a politician, a bundler
 collects contributions from dozens of different individuals and
 presents the sum in one payment Naturally then, in the spirit of Kris Kristofferson s famous
 observation that Nothin ain t worth nothin when it s
 free, they have to be rewarded once the candidate they
 backed secures the White House The easiest way is a comfortable
 ambassadorship, where the US taxpayer can keep them in style for
 a few years The most successful bundlers (bringing in $500,000+)

 year ahead of President Obama at Harvard Law School That said,
 Schapiro is somewhat different to most of Obama s motley crew He
 has family connections to the Czech Republic where his
 Prague born mother, Raya, was a Holocaust refugee His
 Grandmother and Uncle both stayed behind and died, both in
 Poland, one at Auschwitz and the other at Treblinka It s beyond any doubt that Schapiro would be fully aware that
 Russian led Soviet forces liberated those German death camps 
 Even if Treblinka had already been demolished by the Nazi s in a
 futile cover up attempt Ironically, the first Soviet officer to
 enter Auschwitz wasAnatoly Shapiro, a namesake The Ambassador s history makes his attempt to bully President
 Milos Zeman look even more ridiculous However, one thing
 Americans don t like is for their edicts to be ignored When you
 believe your nation to be indispensable ù how dare anybody
 question its orders? What s clear is that once Barack Obama announced that he would
 not be attending the 70th anniversary of Victory Day in Moscow,
 the State Department expected all allied countries to fall in
 line Other than Greece (which is in dispute with the EU) and
 Cyprus, everyone else has played ball except the Czechs Completely unqualified for his role, Schapiro weighed in and
 directly criticized Milos Zeman s choice to visit Moscow on May
 9 I can t even imagine the American reaction if the Czech
 ambassador took Obama to task for choosing to recognize Cuba or
 supporting an illegal coup in nearby Ukraine, to give two
 examples Once most Americans had figured out where the Czech
 Republic actually is, the Ambassador would be vilified I m in the U S for the holiday weekend I wake up, turn on
 computer, and see that a lot happened while I was asleep!#GladITurnedMyPhoneOff î Andrew Schapiro (@AndySchapiro)April
 5, 2015 Zeman claims that he s visiting Moscow to give thanks ùfor the fact that Czechs are not speaking German nowadays 
 Another unmentioned historical fact is that Czechoslovakia (as it
 was then) was effectively handed to Hitler by the free world in
 1938 Conversely, Soviet tanks rolled into Prague 30 years later
 to viciously quell an uprising Hence, Czechs have very
 ambivalent attitudes to both Russia and the Western powers Given
 their historical experiences, Czechs generally believe that they
 can trust neither side Their President has virulently opposed the veneration of Stepan
 Bandera by the post coup regime in Ukraine In January, he noted
 that Bandera had intended to establish a Nazi puppet state if
 Germany had succeeded in permanently removing Ukraine from the
 USSR Like his predecessor, Vaclav Klaus, Zeman has also beencriticalof American led sanctions against Russia Last week, Zeman attacked historical revisionists, pointing out
 that the USSR didn t annex Czechoslovakia after the war Soviet soldiers came in 1945 as liberators and by the autumn
 of that year had left our country, ùhe said In 1946,
 free elections took place which, unfortunately, were won by the
 Communist Party Schapiro claimed that Zeman s Moscow plans were short sighted as it would be awkward if the
 Czech President was the only statesman from an EU country on Red
 Square The bundler turned bungler is obviously unaware of the
 scheduled Greek and Cypriot attendance German chancellor Angela
 Merkel is expected to travel to Moscow the next day, May 10th Now that Zeman has barred Schapiro from Prague Castle, the
 residence of the Czech President, the next installment of this
 t√™te √† t√™te will be fascinating The President is certain to come
 under massive pressure from certain elements in his own
 government to backtrack However, with three years remaining of
 his five year term, he s unlikely to easily surrender For the US, we might have reached a fork in the road of its
 treatment of Eastern Europe I detect a feeling that support for
 American policy against Russia was taken for granted by
 Washington However, the Ukraine crisis has changed all that 
 While the Baltic nations will back US policy to the bitter end,
 for what they consider to be existential reasons, many Balkan and
 former Warsaw pact members are taking a different view With moribund economies or in Greece s case barely any economy at
 all; many are wondering if the zero sum game espoused by
 Washington and Brussels is really beneficial While most
 post communist EU states made rapid progress following their
 initial accession, improvements have almost completely stalled
 since 2008 Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have all
 expressed varying degrees of discomfort at the EU s Russia
 policy As have Greece and Cyprus which didn t endure communism 
 Additionally, Serbia and Turkey both EU candidates have both
 strongly opposed anti Russia sanctions Washington now has a clear choice Continue to bully Eastern
 Europe and risk watching support for the US crumble, or listen to
 the concerns of the region The problem is that this would
 involve admitting that American Ukraine policy has been
 boneheaded and that Russia has a key role to play in Eastern
 Europe They could start by appointing some real diplomats to the
 likes of Prague and Budapest, not Obama bagmen and women with a

 the legitimacy of the new leadership in Kiev and also investigate
 its alleged crimes Do you think any of that will actually
 happen? Daniel McAdams:Well, I m pretty skeptical about
 these kinds of investigations, but the core disagreement between
 the US, the EU and Russia is really very simple was the
 government installed after the coup legal, or is it not? And is
 Yanukovich legally, according to Ukrainian constitution still the
 president? So everything else I think is sort of window dressing 
 The two sides fundamentally disagree on this I think there is a quite easy solution to this problem, which is
 probably, not that I m in the business of giving advice, but go
 back to the 21 February agreement where you will have an
 extremely weak president in power He will have some sort of a
 technical government taking over until the elections can be
 organized It is a face saving measure for the US The Russians
 don t get everything that they want The problem can be solved,
 but it will take some sacrifice, some listening and some
 consideration that the coup is not legitimate RT:And the things have moved on now rapidly
 with this upcoming referendum in Crimea on Sunday Why are the
 Western governments so opposed to its bid for independence? DM:Well you know it is funny, former ambassador
 to Moscow Michal McFaul has been twitting away about Crimea is
 not Kosovo, Crimea is not Kosovo! ù Madeline Albright, former
 secretary of state has chimed in as well It is kind of interesting to see the people who supported the
 lawless coup in the streets of Kiev, now all of the sudden being
 the strongest stringers for every fine point in the Ukrainian
 constitution You know it is quite funny The point of the matter
 is that there are differences and there are similarities RT:Alright, what are the parallels then? Do
 you think the Crimeans do have the right to draw a parallel to
 what happened in Kosovo? DM:Well the point to be made is the double
 standards of the US and the hypocrisy of the US The US has been
 endlessly going on about the will of the Albanian people in
 Kosovo, how they have the right to express their view and their
 will and have their own future And now that the shoe is on the other foot, the place that they
 don t want to break away, they are saying something very, very
 different Which is that they don t have the right to do the same
 thing So the hypocrisy is more important, than whether or not
 they have the right to do this RT:If the vote does go ahead, and the
 Crimeans vote for independence, the G7 says they will not
 recognize this bid for independence What actually could these
 countries do about it? DM:Well are they going to isolate, are they
 going to sanction a major world power, in particularly when you
 have both China and India recently expressing support for the
 Russian position? It is absurd This is not Syria, this is not
 Cuba that you are going to embargo In any case sanctions are an
 act of war And it is a ridiculous move for the US and EU to
 face Even the referendum is not necessary if you go back to the

 do that? I doubt it ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/west-sanctions-russia-absurd-446/
"11 Mar, 2014",US uses law on aid to post-coup governments as ‚Äòpolitical football‚Äô,"The US has double standards when it comes to suspending aid to countries where the authorities have been overthrown by force, Egypt and Ukraine are a clear example, Jeffrey Steinberg, Executive Intelligence Review senior editor, told RT RT:Ukraine s deposed leader claims
 Washington is breaking its own laws when offering money to the
 current authorities in Kiev So does Yanukovich have a point
 here?Jeffrey Steinberg:I think he absolutely has a
 point he s correct that under US law, all US aid must be
 suspended if a legitimately elected government has been
 overthrown by military force or other kinds of coup activity 
 This is not some esoteric issue; it s come up in two recent
 instances Number one in Egypt last summer when the military
 stepped in and deposed the Morsi government after tens of
 millions of people turned out in the street, there was a
 ferocious debate in the Obama administration and in the Congress
 over whether it was to be technically labeled a coup, and
 ironically, under that debate, Senator John McCain was one of the
 leading voices arguing for a total cutoff of all military aid to
 Egypt So now he is on the exact opposite side of the same
 debate So clearly this law is being used as a political football It s
 applied in instances where it suits the policies of the
 administration and certain hardline allies in congress and it s
 freely ignored when it s an inconvenient truth And here in the
 case of Ukraine, nobody can dispute the fact that number one, the
 Yanukovich government was legitimately elected, and number two
 that it was overthrown by military force involving the most
 severe right wing neo Nazi and neo fascist elements who were in
 the Maidan and who in fact rejected the agreement that was signed
 by Yanukovich, the three opposition parties, and the foreign
 ministers of Germany, France and Poland, with a Russian observer
 present just days before the coup So I really think it is a case
 where Yanukovich has some very legitimate points to be raised,
 and I understand he intends to bring this before the US courts
 and before the US congress RT:A dozen US fighter jets and hundreds of
 personnel are off to Ukraine s borders A Pentagon spokesman says
 quote what we are doing is reassuring our allies that we are
 there for them ù Where s this heading, do you think?JS:Well, it s directed against Russia 
 President Obama has had kind of a personal obsession with
 President Putin since the beginning of his presidency; it s one
 of the reasons he sent Michael McFaul as a kind of provocation,
 in your face against the Russian government, and I think that
 we ve got to be very blunt here that when you have NATO and
 American military forces right up against the borders of Russia
 at the same time that the US is deploying missile defense into
 Romania, missile defense systems are now actively present in
 western Europe aboard the Arleigh Burke destroyers in Rota,
 Spain, that this is not just a danger of a limited confrontation,
 but this is a danger of a war that could escalate into a general
 war, and even a thermonuclear war confrontation Many American analysts Lyndon LaRouche, the founder of my
 publication, Paul Craig Roberts, a number of others, have said
 that this administration in Washington, in backing an illegal US
 and European funded coup in Ukraine, is running the risk in
 greatly escalating the danger of a military confrontation that
 could go thermonuclear ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-egypt-ukraine-aid-194/
"3 Mar, 2014",Anti-Russian rants are just PR ahead of EU parliamentary poll ‚Äì Russian officials,"The various anti Russian statements voiced by EU officials should be taken with a grain of salt as they are just attempting to lure voters ahead of the May poll, and are not interested in Ukraine actually joining the EU, a senior Russian senator holds All this hysteria in the European Union are nothing more
 than a PR bubble created in the lead up to European Parliamentary
 elections on May 25, ù Andrey Klimov, a deputy head of the
 Federation Council s committee for international relations, told
 Russian mass circulation daily Izvestia All forecasts say that its next composition will have a lot
 of Euroskeptics and the current commissioners headed by President
 Jose Manuel Barroso will have to resign For this reason their
 current statements should be divided by at least two people
 often lie during election campaigns, ù Klimov said The comment was made ahead of the urgent meeting of foreign
 ministers of the EU countries dedicated to the current situation
 in Ukraine and the possible measures against Russia that had
 already announced its readiness to protect its citizens, ethnic
 Russians and Russian speakers caught in the Ukrainian turmoil Other European reaction to the Russian political support of the
 Eastern regions of Ukraine ranged from statements of concern to
 recalling of ambassadors from Russia to a request for an
 extraordinary session of the NATO council Klimov noted that it was very unlikely that EU officials would
 continue the current course of supporting the Maidan 
 authorities in Kiev after the May elections are over according
 to the Russian senator, the realists among European politicians
 understand very well that the European economy cannot afford
 another hanger on The senator also commented on the threats of economic sanctions
 against Russia made by US officials and politicians, such as
 former Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul Klimov noted that the
 current trade turnover between the US and Russia is far from
 anything serious and such sanctions on the part of the US would
 not do Russia any sufficient harm On the other hand, the mutual dependence between Russia and
 European Union is very strong and there is no common position
 among EU members on the current crisis, the politician added 
 This means that the European countries can soon start separate
 talks with Russia, Klimov concluded In the current situation I would recommend that Brussels and
 Washington introduce sanctions against each other The US must
 answer for instigating a civil war and adding to the explosive
 situation in Europe A number of EU countries should be made
 responsible for opening the Pandora s box by violating the
 February 21 agreement of Ukrainian stabilization, ù he noted Many top level Russian politicians observed in public addresses
 that no one in Russia was interested in war with its neighbor 
 Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said during a Sunday
 televised panel discussion that Russian diplomats strongly
 opposed the unfounded accusations of war mongering We will support all forces that favor the strengthening of
 bilateral relations between our countries, especially now when
 the European stability depends on these relations Western
 politicians who are currently cursing us must understand
 this, ù Karasin stated In the same program the head of the Russian upper house,
 Valentina Matvienko, reiterated her position that only Ukrainian
 people can decide who will run their state and this decision must
 be made through an honest, clear, transparent and lawful
 elections The head of Russian senate also supported the idea of
 rendering financial and humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people The chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs, Leonid
 Slutsky, said that all Russia had done in Crimea was defend sites
 belonging to its Navy, but it can also extend this protection to
 everyone who asks for this as this is a noble thing to do The Russian upper house has approved Vladimir Putin s request to
 sanction the military involvement in the standoff between
 pro Russian population of the Eastern regions of Ukraine and the
 new authorities in Kiev However, Putin not only has not given
 orders to the troops, but according to presidential spokesman
 Dmitry Peskov, has not yet taken the decision that such
 involvement was necessary On Sunday Vladimir Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela
 Merkel and the two leaders agreed to immediately establish a

 retaliate at any moment, the security official in Damascus
 told AFP The Syrian Prime Minister also stated readiness for any possible
 foreign strikes against it, saying that: The Syrian army is
 fully ready, its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or
 scenario that they want to carry out, ùin a written statement
 which was broadcast on television This comes as the UN chemical inspection team finished its work
 in the Arab country and headed to the Hague with samples taken at
 the sites of alleged chemical attacks Earlier, UN
 Secretary General Ban Ki moon said it may be two weeks before for
 final results of their analysis are ready The US, which has been mulling a military strike on Syria, said
 they would not attack while the UN team was still in the country 
 Following State Secretary John Kerry s Friday Speech, French
 President Francois Hollande however declared that a strike could
 come by September 4 US intelligence agencies claim that a chemical weapons attack
 near Damascus on August 21 killed a total of 1,429 Syrian
 civilians, including 426 children The intelligence gathered for
 the report, revealed Friday, allegedly featured an intercepted
 communication by a senior Syrian government official familiar
 with the attack as well as other human, signals and satellite
 intelligence The report stated that President Bashar
 Assad s † was allegedly responsible for the attack President
 Barack Obama used the data to make the case for retaliation
 against the Syrian government On Saturday, Russia s president, Vladimir Putin, declared that
 the idea that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons on
 its own people was utter nonsense Calling the attack a
 provocation by Middle East forces seeking to get the US
 involved, he urged Washington to present its evidence to the UN
 Security Council At a meeting on the same day between Russian Deputy Foreign
 Minister Sergey Ryabkov and US Ambassador in Russia Michael
 McFaul, it was emphasized that the report by the working
 group of international experts in Syria shall be subject to
 consideration by the Security Council, Russia s Foreign
 Ministry said Russia also clearly stated that any military action against
 Syria by the US, bypassing the UN Security Council, would be an
 act of aggression and a flagrant violation of international
 law Russia and China have vetoed three resolutions that would
 increase pressure on Bashar Assad since the start of the war
 conflict in spring 2011 They are also against a current proposal
 by the US, the UK and France (the three Western permanent members
 of the Security Council) for a resolution that would allow
 military action against Syria over a chemical weapons attack
 which the West blames on the regime, and the government blames on
 the rebels Earlier this week German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized
 Russia and China over their stance in the Syrian crisis It is very regrettable that Russia and China have refused for
 some time to come to a common position [with Western partners] on
 the Syrian conflict This considerably weakens the role of the
 United Nations, Merkel said in an interview with German
 newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine, published Saturday Merkel ruled out German participation in any military action
 without international approval Germany cannot participate in any military intervention
 without a mandate from the United Nations, NATO or the EU, 
 added Merkel, who is seeking re election as chancellor for a
 third consecutive term in late September A poll published Thursday showed German public opinion against
 military action by the West in Syria, with about three fifths
 opposed to any potential strikes, and only about one third in
 favor of military intervention Another poll showed that most French people do not want France to
 take part in military action on Syria, either, and that most do
 not trust French President Francois Hollande to do so A BVA poll
 released by Le Parisien Aujourd hui en France, showed that 64
 percent of respondents opposed military action, 58 percent did
 not trust Hollande to conduct it, and 35 percent feared it could
 set the entire region [Middle East] ablaze The French president said that Britain s parliamentary vote,
 which rejected a motion authorizing military action in Syria on
 Thursday, would not affect France s own actions, however Hollande, whose popularity has been affected by the economic
 slowdown, showed unexpected military vigor when he dispatched
 troops to help Mali s government fend off Islamist rebels earlier
 this year in Africa, an intervention then backed by two thirds of
 the French public On Thursday, British lawmakers voted against military
 intervention in Syria by a 285 to 272 margin, rejecting the
 government s motion to support military action against Syria in
 principle The motion came after Cameron made his case in favor
 of missile strikes and many in Parliament cast doubt on his
 assertions It is clear to me the British Parliament,
 reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see
 British military action, Prime Minister David Cameron said

"14 Aug, 2013",US ambassador puzzled after finding his image on Navalny campaign poster,"The US Ambassador to Russia has discovered his photo on a stand used by supporters of opposition blogger Aleksey Navalny, who is currently running in the Moscow mayoral race Michael McFaul announced the news on his Facebook page and posted
 a photograph with one of Aleksey Navalny s campaign posters with
 life size photographs of male and female supporters The male
 figure had McFaul s face, either glued on the spot or
 photoshopped The ambassador wrote that he received the picture from
 someone ù via twitter and the mysterious person asked him
 if the image was altered artificially Of course it is! ù,
 the diplomat said But the mere fact that someone is asking
 such a question is depressing Tragic that someone could even
 think for a moment that this photo is real, ù McFaul
 elaborated before asking his Facebook friends to explain the
 situation Facebook users suggestions ranged from mere hooliganism and
 idiocy ù to a deliberate anti Navalny campaign launched by
 the bloggers competitors However, the author of the latter
 theory did not explain why the alleged slanderers sent the image
 to McFaul instead of spreading it among the public The situation with the ambassador was not the only scandal that
 developed around the mayoral campaign and candidate Aleksey
 Navalny this week Late on Tuesday, city police reported that
 they seized about two tons of illegal propaganda ù from an
 apartment in the city center that they called Navalny s electoral
 headquarters The operation was prompted by a complaint filed by an anonymous
 citizen, but when police arrived at the scene another mayoral
 candidate Nikolai Levichev of the Fair Russia party also
 arrived with a team of supporters and a group of journalists For
 several hours people from Navalny s team remained behind the
 locked metal door and demanded that policemen produced a search
 warrant Eventually law enforcers said that the neighbors noticed
 smoke emerging from the apartment, removed the door with a
 circular saw and got in All the campaign materials were seized and four people who were
 in the apartment and unwilling to confirm their identities were
 briefly detained They now face charges of refusing to comply
 with a police officer s orders (an administrative offence with a
 maximum punishment of 15 days in jail) On Wednesday afternoon the Moscow police press service explained
 that they did not need a warrant to enter the apartment as it was
 being rented and the landlady had given prior authorization to
 enter the premises after officers contacted her and described the
 situation The woman herself confirmed this in an interview with Izvestia
 daily Also in the afternoon a Moscow court imposed a 1000 rouble (about
 $30) fine on each of two of the detained activists for hindering
 law enforcers work One more supporter of Navalny was sentenced
 to 10 days of administrative arrest One of the reporters who was covering the events from the
 stairwell said that he was physically attacked by a man from
 Levichev s team, while Fair Russia insisted that the journalist
 himself attempted to start the fight So far the mutual
 accusations have not sparked any criminal proceedings Navalny s official elections HQ said that the detained activists
 were acting on their own initiative and did not coordinate their
 work with Navalny or his representatives They, however, noted
 that the actions of the would be promoters were absolutely legal The Moscow Election Commission, on the other hand, has said that
 the discovered materials had been made with violations Part of
 it, for example, did not bear labels identifying the organization
 that had commissioned the printing The rest of the content was
 marked as Navalny s official materials, although their quantity
 was larger than officially reported To this, the head of Navalny s HQ Leonid Volkov noted that the
 slogan on the stickers in question ( Do not lie and do not
 steal ù) bore no particular names and therefore cannot be
 considered campaign materials at all Moscow mayoral elections are set for September 8 According to
 the latest opinion polls, Navalny, who is running for the liberal

"11 Jan, 2013",2013: Year of redeeming the Russia-US reset?,"Amid rumors that US President Barack Obama will send a message to Vladimir Putin at the end of January, is the United States finally prepared to give the reset a much needed boost? Despite the bilateral enthusiasm that accompanied the Russia US reset, relations between the two nuclear superpowers remain frosty Indeed, there has even been talk of another Cold War ù emerging between the two Soviet era enemies However, now that the election cycle in Russia and the US is over, political analysts are watching to see if Moscow and Washington can find the political will to finally forge a meaningful partnership The first sign of a possible thaw came with the news that Obama will send his National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon to Moscow in late January to meet with President Putin At the end of January, shortly after Barack Obama is sworn in, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon will come to Moscow on a special mission, ù Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday The US President s envoy is expected to meet with Vladimir Putin ù(Donilon) is expected to convey a message from the US President to the Russian leader, the article said Only Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul are expected to be present at the meeting, Kommersant reported In the heat of last year s US presidential campaign season, which pitted Obama against the Republican challenger, Mitt Russia is America s number one geopolitical foe Romney, the Democratic leader told former President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more flexibility ù after the elections On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this can be solved but it s important to give me space, ù Obama was overheard telling Medvedev courtesy of an open mic This is my last election After my election I have more flexibility ùNow, political analysts are pondering whether the deterioration in Russia US relations is due to Washington s fiercely partisan political climate, divided as it is between Democratic and Republican animosities, or if it is simply a case that the Obama administration was never serious about fortifying the bilateral partnership To date, the single issue undermining the Russia US reset is Washington s plan for installing a missile defense shield in Europe, just miles from the Russian border Ostensibly designed to protect Eastern Europe from rogue missile attack, the US ABM system threatens to throw a monkey wrench into the strategic balance of the region Moscow has warned the US and NATO on numerous occasions that unless the two sides can reach agreement on the system, the world is heading for another arms race ùDespite such grim prospects, Washington continues to deny Russia s participation in the project, while even refusing to provide Moscow with legal assurances that the system will not, in some hypothetical future crisis (a Romney presidency?) aim the technology at Russia s nuclear arsenal At the same time, the US missile defense shield is a small part of an increasingly large machine, collected under the aegis of NATO, which continues its eastward march The 28 state military bloc is on a constant membership drive that seems to know no limits Even Georgia, the Caucasian nation that launched a military offensive against South Ossetia in August 2008, killing Russian peacekeepers and triggering a 5 day conflict with Russia, has been declared a worthy candidate for membership These disturbing facts open a can of worms regarding Washington s ultimate motives for pursuing a reset with Moscow in the first place The irony has not been lost on many Russians that at the same time the Obama administration is pushing for renewed bilateral relations, even signing a New Start ballistic missile reduction treaty with Russia, it is adamantly opposed to Russia s participation in the missile defense project Finally, one of the main architects of the Russia US reset, Michael McFaul, was appointed by Barack Obama to the post of US Ambassador to Russia at practically the same moment that Russia was experiencing street protests The fact is that McFaul is not an expert on Russia, said Channel One analyst Mikhail Leontyev, one of the individuals who spoke out against McFaul s nomination Commenting on the title of McFaul s 2001 book † An Unfinished Revolution in Russia, The political change from Gorbachev to Putin Leontyev ventured to ask, Has Mr McFaul arrived in Russia to work on his specialty? That is, to finish the revolution? It is this sort of suspicion on both sides of the Atlantic that Moscow and Washington will have to overcome before any real breakthrough can be made in the reset Robert Bridge, RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-us-moscow-washington-reset-2013-783/

Why would US sponsored NGOs want to conceal that funding?Michael McFaul: In terms of transparency, the Obama administration supports the general idea of transparency And we domestically have put a lot of effort into that As a government here it is called open government ù we have a very similar set of policies and programs that the president has pushed forward And internationally we have been very involved too We have something called the open government initiative ù that we signed up with other countries to have pledges to do that So, the principle of transparency, we think, is a good one People should know the sources of funding; no one has any trouble with that What we are finding more troubling is the notion that if one takes money from a foundation that is abroad, that group gets labeled as an agent ù of that country That is just not empirically true That is not true I, I can tell you, used to run an NGO when I was a professor at Stanford University We took money from all kinds of different sources, including foreign sources But nobody would ever confuse the center that I ran in Stanford as being an agent ù of those governments I took money, actually, to go to school from a foreign country the UK There is something called the Rhodes Fund and I was a Rhodes Scholar And thanks to that foundation, I was allowed to get my PhD Does that make me an agent of the UK government?So, we think, the principle of transparency is a good one The assumption that to take money from the Hitachi foundation in Japan or a British foundation makes you an agent of that government that is where we have a disagreement with the legislation RT: So, what were exactly the ways around ù the US Secretary of State was talking about?MM: Well, I think we will try to make this more international; I will try to internationalize things, to try to downplay the bilateral part of it And we want to work with the Russian government and with Russian NGOs because we believe the support is important It is important In my country we have hundreds of foundations, hundreds of foreign organizations, I am sure, tens of dozens of governments that actively work in the NGO world and political world We think that is good for our society as an open society and we want to see the similar kind of relations with Russia RT: Staying on the legislative part of it, the Magnitsky bill sanctions a number of Russian officials And many say it s been done to replace the cancelled Jackson Vanik act How much harm do you feel that has done to the reset between the US and Russia?MM: We in the Obama administration have been very clear: we want to engage with Russia, government and society, on security issues, economic issues, democracy and human rights issues And we do that every day I do that every day in doing my job in Russia What we don t want to do is to link issues which we think are unrelated So we have been trying very diligently to avoid linkage between, say, issues with respect to European security and trade, or issues with respect to human rights and security We deliberately are not pursuing a policy of linkage So, with respect to Jackson Vanik and PNTR (Permanent Normalized Trade Relations), we have worked very hard with the Russian government to assist them, and I am just quoting back Mr Putin himself, he said this to my president in Los Cabos [Mexico] a few weeks ago We helped with that process of Russia s accession into the World Trade Organization and now we need to finish our part of that by lifting Jackson Vanik We want to do that in one thing We also want to address human rights violations in Russia and, by the way, in all countries around the world We have looked very closely into the tragic death, the wrongful death, of Mr Magnitsky, the lawyer, and we have taken action with respect to that already And therefore, we don t see why these two things should be linked We don t think one needs to replace the other But we have a democracy, we have an open system, other senators, other members of Congress, other NGOs have spoken loudly on this It is a debate going on in Washington I don t know how it will end; I know what our position is We are going to work very hard to make sure whatever disagreement we have about this legislation, however it ends and I really don t know how it will end because I m not an expert on the US Congress I want to make sure your viewers understand, but we are going to work hard to say, Let s deal with this in this room and let s continue to co operate in literally hundreds of other areas that we co operate with Russia in today ù † That s what we are going to try to do RT: Now, obviously, you said in your writing as well, summarizing the last six months that you have spent here as the US Ambassador, that one of the biggest challenges has been the ongoing situation in Syria The spokesman to the US State Department had come out and said after the senior officials were killed in the attack that it was not surprising But do you think that it has played the big part of the problem in the relationship between the US and Russia when it comes to Syria? The US hasn t been seen to come out and condemn these acts of terrorism that have been carried out within the country and was, at the same time, showing very strong support for the opposition, which is not exactly clear what this opposition is?MM: We, from the very beginning, have always been against any violent means to try to resolve the political impasses in Syria And that has been very clear from the beginning That is why we are so enemy because the regime, after all, killed tens of thousands of people I don t know how one calls it, you said the word terrorism, but let s be clear that tens of thousands of innocent people have died in Syria We think we need to do everything we can, working with the international community to end the violence † all the violence, by the way And we have worked very hard to do that We think that number one Number two is to unite the international community to pressure all the actors in Syria to find a political transition to a new political equilibrium, a new political set of institutions that adheres to the aspirations of the Syrian people That s what we have been trying to do We have been frustrated, very disappointed, in the vote in the Security Council last week We think that would have been a useful step in the right direction to put more pressure on the Assad regime, but we are not going to stop There is too much violence going on It is atrocious what is happening in Syria today We ll continue to work to try to end the violence and to work with our partners around the world to try to pressure both the regime and the opposition to move to a new political outcome there And we believe, as I know you know I watch your show I know we have said this a hundred times: we believe strongly that at some point in that transition it has to be a transition that does not include President Assad RT: One final question You made a mention of the discussion between President Obama and the Russian president Obviously again you said in your writing that it is a critical period in US Russia relations How has the co operation been between the US president and the new Russian president?MM: We were very pleased with that meeting I will be honest with you: we had met with Prime Minister Putin before I used to work at the White House, and so I accompanied President Obama when he came here in July 2009 We had a very interesting, long, philosophical I would even say, meeting with the prime minister I think almost three hours long It was a very interesting meeting But because of the structure of diplomacy we meet with presidents, because we have a presidential system, so over the last three years we have seen a lot more of President Medvedev than Prime Minister Putin And given the transition, as in all courtiers they go through elections and transitions, we had some anxieties not me personally, but others in our government, in our society Is the reset over? ù articles got written many many times in my country We came out of Los Cabos † and I was there, the president asked me to go, and believe me it is really hard to fly from Moscow to Los Cabos, you ve got to work on this connection, but I was very honored to be there † and we came out of that meeting with the firm belief that Russia is committed to the reset President Putin s commitment to this general course in bilateral relations is secure And on most issues † North Korea, Iran, controlling nuclear weapons around the world, fighting terrorism, increasing trade and investment between our two countries (by the way that was a major major theme in their discussion), and how pleased Mr Putin was with the American investment with Rosneft (and what could be between Exxon Mobile and Rosneft could be the largest investments, if not the largest investments in the history of the world) we have spent a lot of time talking about how we need to increase that part of our co operation, and we disagreed on some difficult important issues But the general notion was what we started three and a half years ago, we think, has served security and economic interests, and we came out of that meeting believing that President Putin feels the same way So, now it is a time to get down to work, to develop that personal relationship, and also to develop US Russia relations, disagreeing when we do, but not letting disagreements on one issue say, Well, then we can t work on the other issue ù We don t believe in that kind of linkage And we feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to move forward with what President Obama and President Medvedev originally did to set relations between Russia and the United States RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/russia/usa-russia-cooperation-mcfaul-257/

"29 May, 2012","Putin, Obama plan powwow during G20 summit","President Vladimir Putin and United States President Barack Obama will hold a full scale meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit The Russian and US presidents are scheduled to meet in Los Cabos (Mexico) as part of the G20 summit, ù Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov told reporters on Tuesday It was agreed that it will be a full scale meeting, with even some important documents to be adopted ù The G20 will be held in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, from June 18 19 Ushakov hinted at the possibility of the two leaders issuing a joint presidential statement on further cooperation between our countries The meeting announcement should dispel rumors of a bilateral rift between the two nations that began when Putin canceled his attendance at NATO s Chicago summit earlier this month, followed soon after by a similar announcement by the American leader Obama will not be able to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vladivostok in September as it will be held concurrently with the US Democratic Party Convention Americans will head to the polls on November 4 to vote on whether or not to give Obama another four years in the White House Concerning the nuts and bolts substance of the meeting, the Russian president has expressed his readiness to pay more attention to the US Russian Bilateral Presidential Commission, which has 20 working groups, Ushakov said The presidential aide revealed that the number of bilateral working groups is set to increase Currently, two more groups are about to be formed: on military technical cooperation, which in the old days was out of the question, and on cyber security, he said [Putin] is determined to actively pursue a stable, smooth, constructive relationship with our US partners, he said It is important that the same determination is shared by the White House Ushakov said Moscow does not want to lose the positivity ù achieved between former President Dmitry Medvedev and Obama in recent years We understand that the atmosphere has become more favorable, and we want to further build our cooperation in the same fashion, he said Putin has said on several occasions that the priority in the US Russian relationship is to broaden trade and investment relations, the aide added The more solid the bilateral economic foundation, the stronger the safety net for the entire structure of bilateral relations, ù Ushakov said It could protect them against shifts in the political situation particularly noticeable in pre election periods Meanwhile, Ushakov said there has also been a positive trend in joint efforts in Afghanistan We have good cooperation developing on Afghanistan: about 2,400 US flights have been carried out since September 2009, transporting over 250,000 troops and more than 52,000 tonnes of cargo Thirty eight thousand NATO containers went on our railways and so on, the aide said Despite the high optimism, however, there are some ominous clouds on the horizon that could dampen the relationship For example, if the United States adopts a new anti Russian law, Moscow would be forced to take retaliatory measures, warned Ushakov If the new anti Russian law (Magnitsky Act) is passed this law should be met with a tit for tat response, the Kremlin official told reporters US Congress has drafted a bill that would place sanctions against the persons allegedly responsible for the death of lawyer Sergey Magnitsky The initiator of the bill, entitled Sergey Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, is Democratic Senator Benjamin Cardin Ushakov also expressed the hope that the US anti Soviet [Jackson Vanik] amendment does not turn into an anti Russian law The aide believes the Jackson Vanik amendment that is still in effect would be more disadvantageous for the Americans, as their companies may find themselves in a losing situation on the Russian market, compared with competitors from Europe and Asia We have become accustomed to the Jackson Vanik amendment, we know how to deal with it, Ushakov said On the thorny subject of a US missile defense shield in Europe, Russia does not rule out the possibility that a breakthrough on the issue will occur after the November elections, he told reporters I do not rule out that some impulse will be given to the talks over this theme (European missile defense) after the American elections; it will be easier to talk then, Ushakov said The Kremlin aide then offered a few pointers to US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who has been on the receiving end of Kremlin criticism following some rather undiplomatic utterances McFaul should try to be more diplomatic, ù said Ushakov, who previously served as Russian ambassador to the United States Ambassadors should operate on a positive basis, because even without ambassadors there are plenty of all sorts of actors trying to spoil the atmosphere of the bilateral relationship, he continued Last week, for example, McFaul said at a meeting with students of the Higher School of Economics that Russia bribed Kyrgyzstan in order to close a US air base in the Central Asian country The Foreign Ministry said it was extremely perplexed ù by the US ambassador s remarks Ushakov said such remarks go against the spirit of bilateral cooperation The Russian and US leaders aim to maintain the most constructive cooperation, and the ambassadors should act precisely in this spirit, without bringing discord into the work of their own leaders, he said I noticed that McFaul has been fairly self critical and after each of his public escapades he would admit, Sorry guys, yes, I made a mess here But words are not like a bird † once they re out, you cannot catch them, the presidential aide said I tried to be more diplomatic, and he should still be diplomatic Robert Bridge, RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/obama-putin-russia-us-g20-mcfaul-reset-496/
"20 Apr, 2012",Post-election Russia: Putin‚Äôs new ideology,"Russia s instability, emphasized by the recent elections, has prompted an elaborate political transformation Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes Vladimir Putin s top priority as president should be to adopt a new state ideology In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view Russia s recent parliamentary and presidential elections took place amidst a deepening global economic crisis, and were characterized by growing unrest in some of Russia s regions The rising social and political tension culminated in mass street protests in Moscow and St Petersburg throughout the past winter This invites a question as to what the Russian government should do to promote reconciliation and consolidation within Russian society, and to enhance its own legitimacy To this end, it would be advisable for Russia to embrace a new state ideology based on three pillars: Spirituality, Greatness and Dignity Such a move seems all the more desirable, since the recent presidential election was marked by blatant attempts at influencing Russian politics by foreign powers, with the United States and Britain openly backing diehard anti Putin opposition in Russia, and US Ambassador Michael McFaul holding regular meetings with opposition leaders in Moscow Numerous developments in recent years (2008 î2012) indicate that the world has entered a period of profound political, economic, financial and ideological transformation As social and economic challenges mount in Europe and the United States, the globalist world order is increasingly shifting toward the unashamed use of controlled chaos ù strategies This attitude had its heyday in Libya, where NATO set a malicious precedent for brazenly intervening in the domestic affairs of a sovereign nation, invading it and deliberately sowing chaos for years to come Today, the alliance is pursuing a similar policy in Syria What nation will it choose to invade next? Could it be China, or India, or Russia?The escalating violence in Syria provided a rather compelling background for Russia s presidential race this year The recent campaign was exceptionally difficult and stressful for Vladimir Putin, but he still scored a sweeping victory at the end of the day, thanks to the tens of millions of truly patriotic voters Putin s electoral triumph signifies Russia s victory in countering a foreign media aggression It means that Russia s consolidated forces of reason have effectively prevented a British led scenario for crippling Russia, February 1917 style However, the media warfare carries on That suggests a key priority for Russia s newly elected president, which is to promote the nation s spiritual development while maintaining stability, securing the state and the public against a global crisis in a situation of profound change in the global architecture Russia s spiritual progress would encourage positive change worldwide A spiritual Russia is capable of accommodating all the basic human and social values, such as justice, patriotism, diversity, etc Mass media and ideology are admittedly the weakest spots of modern day Russia s statehood A number of Russia s public institutions and practices apparently beg to be reformed in the nearest future, and proper interaction between the state and civilsociety is a desperate necessity All the more so since the recent election has demonstrated that Vladimir Putin and his policies no longer enjoy the kind of popular support they had some five or 10 years ago In this situation, the Russian government should adjust some of its policies, as well as propose a national agenda to the public, as in a set of underlying values in charting the nation s strategic development goals Such a national agenda should draw a nationwide discussion, enjoy extensive media coverage and ideological promotion, and be finalized through an all Russian Representative Assembly Vladimir Putin could announce the convocation of such an assembly while paying tribute to Kuzma Minin s monument in Nizhny Nogorod on 4 November 2012, scheduling the meeting for 7 January 2013 A new Russia could find its major national symbols in the great personalities of the past, such as Aleksandr Nevsky, Reverend Sergius of Radonezh and Reverend Seraphim of Sarov, scientist and educator Mikhail Lomonosov, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, poet Aleksandr Pushkin, writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, chemist Dmitry Mendeleev, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, etc Nationwide reforms need to be carefully deliberated and planned, and then implemented swiftly and decisively Among the top priorities, all branches of power should engage every civilsociety institution and every political party in discussion over the essence of the much needed change with regard to mass media and ideology To that end, expert analysis will be indispensable Successful examples of such crucial deliberation in the middle of a crisis can be found in world history, including Russia s own history Nizhny Novgorod citizen Kuzma Minin spearheaded a historic process of national consolidation and revival that enabled Russia to resurge from the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century That why it is so important to analyze the historic experience of the all Russian Representative Assembly of 1613 †A comprehensive, nationwide public discussion on a new national agenda to be finalized by a Representative Assembly could enable Russia to overcome disunity and endure the looming political crisis Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, specially for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russia-putin-ideology-panarin-535/
"10 Mar, 2012",March 2012: Media warfare targets Putin‚Äôs legitimacy,"The opposition rally in Moscow on March 10 is yet another act of media warfare against Vladimir Putin s resounding victory in the election, and the opposition and Western media are aiming to undermine Putin s legitimacy believes writer Igor Panarin In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view The media campaign against Vladimir Putin has failed to accomplish the main objective for its Stage One, which was to take Russia s presidential election to a second round Mr Putin scored around 64 per cent of the vote, which is even more than what the Russian Public Opinion Research Center had predicted prior to the election This is probably one of the reasons you could see tears in Putin s eyes during the rally in his support, which took place in Manezhnaya Square on the night of March 4 and attracted some 110,000 people: these were tears of happiness over such a convincing victory †You have to consider the enormous pressure he was exposed to throughout the campaign and during the vote count, both internationally (the crisis in Syria) and domestically (street protests of the opposition backed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael McFaul, and virulent campaigning in the Internet, which the pro Putin party had completely lost) However, the surge in protest activity following the parliamentary election last December only boosted Putin s vote total in the long run, as it urged all the sane and patriotic minded Russians to show up for the election in order to counter the threat †I myself went to vote around 12:30 pm on March 4 The voting procedure was excellently organized Everything was calm and orderly, and the police guarding the polling station performed smoothly and were polite There were public observers present I even had to wait in line a little, with six other people casting their ballots ahead of me There were generally many more people at the station than at any other election previously, which means voter turnout was high this time †There was generally an air of balance and reason at the polling station Voters were very diverse in terms of age, ranging from students to senior citizens As I was leaving to go home, there was a flow of people heading in the opposite direction something I have not seen for a long time in Moscow †If we were to imagine the average pro Putin voter, it would primarily be a sober minded conservative who believes Russia needs a strong government In this sense, Putin s supporters are somewhat similar to those of Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov Most pro Putin voters are workers united in trade unions Naturally, there are also the military, the secret services and the defense industry Even though there have been some very impressive decisions made with regard to pensioners, the elderly demographic was dispersed among Putin, Zyuganov and the leader of the Fair Russia Party, Sergey Mironov As for the supporters of Mikhail Prokhorov, they are mostly people aged between 20 and 40, successful professionals who look forward to realizing their full potential But I am sure there is something they do not realize, namely, that if Russia were to have a weak government, they would soon be disappointed †I believe Vladimir Putin is the only possible leader capable of managing a smooth transition to a Eurasian Union in a situation where the European Union has all but collapsed The world needs an economic powerhouse that would be stable and reliable, and that is what Russia should become This would bring more investment to the Russian economy, which would essentially enable us to drastically improve our quality of life †Putin s biggest problem is the fact that no one bothers to explain this rationale Therefore, the area of PR and ideology is where we are failing, since no one in particular is in charge of it That is why Russia needs to introduce a state ideology (Spirituality, Greatness, Dignity) I think the only way Vladimir Putin will be able to complete his presidential term is by introducing such a notion to the Russian Constitution following a comprehensive, nationwide public discussion †Also required are media support and public awareness efforts to back a future Eurasian Union and its integration vehicles †Meanwhile, the recent opposition rally of March 5 marked a new stage in media warfare against Russia By inciting unrest in Moscow s Pushkinskaya Square, the opposition has embraced the tactics of provocation Notably, the signal for such a transition came from London The Guardian announced a battle to unfold in the next 24 hours ù as early as the morning of March 5, essentially proving my point about deliberate interference in Russian affairs on the part of Great Britain †The new objective of the media campaign against Russia, including the rally on March 10, is to undermine Putin s legitimacy and force him to resign, with the ultimate goal of destroying Russian statehood The nearest deadline is supposedly August 2014 †Vladimir Putin s deposition would mean turmoil for Russia He is the only political personality in today s Russia capable of accomplishing economic integration across Eurasia, making Russia a global center of gravity in political and economic terms However, to that end Mr Putin would need to respond to certain challenges and get rid of some dead weight among his entourage In fact, the recent protests were largely aimed against a certain personnel policy rather than Putin personally What irritates people is the fact that certain ministries or state owned companies are headed by incompetent and unprofessional executives who keep their offices merely thanks to being close to Vladimir Putin †Thus, I believe, there are attempts at destabilizing Russia being orchestrated from abroad Their purpose is to weaken Putin s standing as much as possible, ideally removing him from power, with the ultimate goal of preventing further integration in Eurasia With that in mind, Russia urgently needs an efficient system of media defense which would include both state owned and private assets, to protect the legitimacy of the Russian president Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, specially for RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not

"7 Mar, 2012",Anti-Russian sentiment spikes in US,"Moscow and Washington are at loggerheads as Russia which just overwhelmingly voted Vladimir Putin into the presidential office for the next six years demonstrates it will independently pursue its own foreign policy agenda Tensions between the two countries broke to the surface following a recent UN resolution vote on Syria, which is experiencing a protracted conflict between government and opposition forces The resolution would have demanded that Syrian government forces retreat from conflict zones and essentially lay down their arms Russia,

of State Hillary Clinton slammed Moscow s veto as despicable, ù while the Russian Foreign Ministry responded that Washington s reaction was hysterical ùAlexey Pushkov, head of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, did not betray any secrets when he told reporters on Tuesday that not everyone is happy about Russia s independent foreign policy There are opinions that Russia must become a servicing partner, although this idea is not favored by everyone and everywhere, he added The Duma deputy then mentioned Putin s stand on foreign policy, outlined in a pre election article, in which the president elect warned that foreign actors on the geopolitical stage may be tempted to solve their problems at someone else s cost by means of force The president elect said that Russia should never be in a situation where it may tempt anyone by our weakness ùPutin s warning took on immediate relevancy this week when US Senator John McCain called on fellow colleagues to support a military offensive against Syria The time has come for a new policy, McCain said during remarks on the Senate floor The United States should lead an international effort to protect key population centers in Syria, especially in the north, through air strikes on Assad s forces Although McCain s plan ultimately failed to generate enough support, his comments underscore the tendency on the part of many US politicians and planners to jump headlong into military action † in direct opposition to Russia s stated foreign policy Meanwhile, with US presidential elections scheduled for November, the Republican nominees are wildly playing the Russian card in an effort to win their party s nomination What the world witnessed in Russia yesterday was a mockery of the democratic process, ù Mitt Romney, a leading Republican nominee said following the announcement that Vladimir Putin had won Instead of stating that it congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the presidential elections, as the Obama administration has done, it should have condemned the flagrant manipulation and media restrictions that marred this election ù(It would be fair to add that Russia s presidential elections had hundreds of thousands of observers at polling stations around the country, as well as the use of video cameras, causing many foreign observers to applaud Russia s coordination of the elections) Romney suggested that President Obama s Russia policy is set back ù rather than reset ù, yet provided little clue as to how the Republicans would set forward ù US relations with Russia, especially given the Republicans recent track record on military misadventures The tit for tat over elections has a rather long history between the two countries In December, Putin expressed his irritation with Washington s response to Russia s parliamentary elections, which provoked an outcry from the political opposition, who said the vote was rigged I looked at the first reaction of our US partners, ù Putin said The first thing that the secretary of state [Hillary Clinton] did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers ù She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal, ù Putin continued They heard the signal and with the support of the US State Department began active work ùThe situation between Moscow and Washington hit more turbulence in January with the announcement that Michael McFaul would be the new US ambassador to Russia, making him only the second ambassador to Russia in 30 years who is not a career diplomat It took just hours for McFaul to attract the wrath of his Russian hosts Pushkov said McFaul had attracted criticism by his own actions taken during the first hours on Russian soil, ù referring to a meeting held between the US ambassador and several members of the political opposition shortly after McFaul assumed his duties It is one thing when such a meeting with representative of the opposition is held in a calm atmosphere, and quite another when it happens as the political situation escalates in Russia in the run up to the presidential election, Pushkov said Meanwhile, on Monday night, as the police arrested some protesters who had gathered in the center of Moscow, McFaul posted on Twitter: Troubling to watch arrests of peaceful demonstrators at Pushkin Square Freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are universal values ùThe Russian Foreign Ministry replied in its own Twitter post: Police on Pushkin were several times more humane than what we saw in the breakup of the Occupy Wall Street protests, the tent camps in Europe ùGiven the increasing tension between Moscow and Washington over critical foreign policy questions, which include the US desire to plant a

"9 Feb, 2012",Comparing Oranges‚Ä¶,"Pro Kremlin politicians and pundits explain the recent mass protests as an orangerevolution ù conspiracy orchestrated by the West Member of the Russian Public Chamber Nikolay Svanidze believes the allegations are a hoax to demonize the opposition In the article below, historian and analyst Nikolay Svanidze explains his view One of the wings of Russia s political spectrum appears to be constantly dominated by hysteria, blaming every instance of public discontent on machinations by the US Department of State A number of parties and politicians are back to the habit of spotting American spy games behind everything This has become the favorite and most commonly employed argument for those backing the Putin government, culminating in a pro Putin rally at the Poklonnaya Hill memorial park on February 4, where speechmakers were getting out of breath stigmatizing the Orange plague ù Sadly, the government itself eagerly relies on this type of supporters Vladimir Putin, for one, has publicly endorsed the Poklonnaya Hill rally Many pro government pundits and observers have rushed to announce a change of tide, ù claiming that pro government rallies are attracting several times more people than opposition protests However, that is an acute case of wishful thinking It is common notion in Russia that official appraisals of rallies strength are notoriously biased, overstating the turnout at pro government events and downplaying protest attendance numbers several times over In fact, the word opposition ù is not really legitimate in this context, as the rallies that attracted tens of thousands of people in Moscow and other cities last December and last week were mainly attended by regular citizens who feel that the existing system of governance deprives them of their civil and political rights It was after Prime Minister Putin denounced the protests and their participants using his rather characteristic choice of derogatory speech that the protest movement indeed turned oppositional Whereas the initial December protests merely demanded that Head of the Central Election Commission Vladimir Churov should resign on account of election fraud, Putin s explicit contempt for the discontented made him the prime target of public scorn As for the two simultaneous and directly antagonistic rallies that took place in Moscow on 4 February 2012, they are hardly comparable While both events were attended by upwards of 100,000 people each, there was a striking difference as regards content While the opposition protest that re assembled at Bolotnaya Square on February 4 had its clearly defined messages and demands, the pro government rally at Poklonnaya Hill had but one purpose: to stick it ù to the Bolotnaya crowd The Poklonnaya meeting was merely a reaction to the Bolotnaya protests, its speakers and slogans being evidently focused on pinning an orangerevolution ù accusation on the protest movement Another thing that revealed how these two events were a world apart was organization Those at Bolotnaya Square came by their own free will, every activist and organizer being a volunteer Of the thousands who made up the crowd at Poklonnaya Hill, the majority were either paid to show up or intimidated into participation by their employers or other authorities I would not rule out that there were also people who came to the memorial park out of their sincere confidence in Vladimir Putin, but numerous reports and revelations show that the rally owed its formidable numbers to administrative mobilization and none of the official rebuttals have so far effectively proved the opposite I have to give credit to the Kremlin s own political consultants, though: staging street action to juxtapose it to an opposition rally was tactically a smart idea However, strategically it is a terribly hazardous gamble, for you effectively pit one part of the populace against another Presenting political opposition as a bunch of unpatriotic upper middle class rascals who deserve to be stomped upon by the good common folk is not only dirty, but also suicidal In whipping up hysteria over a fictional revolution, you risk instigating a very real civil war In a highly stratified and diverse society such as Russia, the Kremlin s current divide and conquer tactics may turn out to be a Pandora s Box But back to the notorious orangerevolution ù speculation Fingering the world s biggest and most ambitious power as the mastermind behind all things evil has repeatedly proved a highly efficient argument among a certain share of Russian society used to the Cold War era reality of the United States being our country s principal adversary Not to mention the perennial trick of finding a foreign enemy to blame for domestic policy failures But let us take a sober look at the global chess board Is Russia challenging the US to global supremacy? Have we been gearing up for war with America? Do they have a reason to perceive us as a threat to be neutralized? If not, then why on Earth would the Americans, tied up as they are with an unwinnable war, a severe economic downturn and social unrest at home, commit so much effort to overthrowing a Russian leader whose trumpeted opposition ù to them has been little more than rhetoric? A popular argument in favor of the Orange conspiracy ù theory is the Ukrainian experience While American influence is admittedly presumed behind the Kiev street protests that propelled a pro Western government into power in 2004, the political situation in today s Russia is only superficially comparable to that in Ukraine seven years back, while its is crucially different in essence In similarity to several post Soviet states, there is a powerful anti Russian sentiment in Ukraine that can be played as a mighty trump card by anyone who wants to rally support for their agenda or political ambition which is exactly what the Ukrainian liberal opposition did In Russia s case, it is not the opposition stirring enmity against a fictional foreign nemesis to impress the public, is it? Secondly, whereas both Ukraine and Georgia had distinct liberal posterboy politicians who enjoyed wide popularity as well as good standing with Western embassies, there is presently NOT A SINGLE liberal politician in Russia who could boast any significant public support Each and every liberal politician in this country is notoriously mistrusted and scorned, and even the recent multi thousand strong street protests explicitly positioned themselves as a no leader movement Should the White House indeed entertain a notion of spinning a prot√©g√© into presidency in Russia, which personality could they possibly spin?Finally, the liberals in the United States might indeed be happy with the prospect of having a more like minded, liberal administration in Moscow to deal with But what are the odds of such a liberal democratic government seizing and keeping power through a revolution in a country like Russia?

"7 Feb, 2012",McFaul and the Moscow opposition rallies,"The February 4 rally to support PM Vladimir Putin officially drew four times as many people as the opposition rally Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes that was the first failure of US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul In the article below, professor Igor Panarin explains his view Michael McFaul first visited Russia during Perestroika Later, in the early 1990s, McFaul headed the Moscow office of the National Endowment for Democracy, the main financing hub of the Russian liberal opposition McFaul, therefore, has known Russian liberal grant receivers for quite a long time McFaul, an employee of both the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Stanford s Hoover Institution, then went on to take part in collective theory building behind the British American project to democratize Ukraine and summarize the experience of destabilizing the country He was among the editors of the 2006 book Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine s Democratic Breakthrough ù After the success in Ukraine, the British lobby in the US (Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton) ordered McFaul to turn to Russia, looking for people who behaved similarly to Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko Ultimately, he found Aleksey Navalny and Maria Gaidar (the daughter of Yegor Gaidar, the father ù of Russian liberal reforms of the early 1990s) Aleksey Navalny, a shy young man with a bit of a personality split, was no celebrity in 2006 However, by 2011 he became Russia s most popular blogger and a charismatic public activist Where did this unstable young man, suffering from a Napoleonic complex, find the money to finance his movement? Well, McFaul is a professional He never fails to pick the right people In 2006, the project Da! ù initiated by Navalny and Gaidar, started receiving donations from the National Endowment for Democracy (McFaul is still on the NED s board of directors) As part of the program to initiate an orange coup ù in Russia, McFaul sent Navalny to study at the Yale University as part of the Yale World Fellows program in 2010 After a thorough comparison of the psychoanalytical portrait (apparently, for reflexive governance purposes) of a Russian Viktor Yushchenko, huge foreign grants were opened Therefore, the author of the Aleksey Navalny project is none other than Michael McFaul Maria Gaidar has temporarily fell out of the race (went to study in the United States) after a major scandal in Kirov surrounding her name (Maria Gaidar was allegedly involved in a car crash causing the death of a 13 year old girl) Immediately after his arrival in Moscow on January 14, Michael McFaul got down to business very actively He carried out several meetings with opposition leaders (January 17 and 22), addressed the public live on Echo of Moscow radio a media stronghold of the Russian liberals Then on January 25 he gave an interview to the influential Kommersant newspaper, and on January 30 he participated in Vladimir Pozner s TV show on nationwide Channel One Aside from media publicity, he started working thoroughly on making anti Putin rallies in Moscow more creatively (together with the founder of the oppositional Novaya Gazeta, former president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev) It seemed that the February 4 rally was bound for success However, the reshuffle in the Kremlin at the end of December 2011 led to a change in Vladimir Putin s election campaign strategy and the beginning of real counter actions to the anti Putin information campaign Also on February 4, despite the freeze of minus 20 degrees Celsius, Poklonnaya Hill saw a huge rally Though it is even hard to breathe in such cold weather, around 140,000 people gathered together, according to police And this is a big achievement of the new head of Vladimir Putin s election campaign Vyacheslav Volodin (First Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office) †So, McFaul has lost, but he has lost only in the first round of this confrontation Time has shown that he knows how to withstand pressure, quickly gets adjusted to a changing situation, and he obviously has some secret plans of how to put the Aleksey Navalny project into life So, it is too early for the Kremlin to relax the fight to prevent chaos and to preserve the Russian statehood is yet to come Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, special to RT The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT ",https://www.rt.com/russia/mcfaul-opposition-rallies-panarin-667/
"25 Jan, 2012",US-Russia relations once elections are over,"US foreign policy veteran Henry Kissinger visited Moscow and met with Vladimir Putin on January 20th Political analyst Igor Panarin believes this meeting marked the launch of a new dialogue on the future shape of US Russia relations In the article below, Panarin explains his view The meeting between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and one time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was not only intended to improve the controversy ridden relations between Russia and the United States, but also to contribute to stabilizing the inside political situation in both countries After two months of relative calm last year, Occupy rallies resumed with renewed fervor in various cities across the US The surge in street protests was coupled with a new political battle between America s Democrats and Republicans in Congress over a sudden increase in the US national debt The difficult compromise negotiated by President Barack Obama on 2 August 2011, which had allowed Washington to avoid a sovereign default, turned out to be a mere respite By mid November 2011, US public debt had topped $15 trillion, putting America on the brink of default yet again On 13 January 2012, President Obama requested the House of Representatives to raise the US debt limit by another $1 2 trillion This was supposed to be a mere formality, prearranged by the President s deal with Congress struck back in August The White House estimated that the new increase in the debt ceiling would help the administration avoid a default until the nation would be through with the presidential election scheduled for November But what had been expected to be a rubber stamping procedure, suddenly turned out to be a stonewalling when the House voted down the president s request on January 18th This unexpected violation of the deal between the White House and Congress has effectively undermined Barack Obama s chances of re election, and subsequently intensified the already ferocious infighting among the Republican presidential nominees Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich soared in the polls after Texas Governor Rick Perry dropped out of the race, urging his supporters to back Gingrich The crucially important South Carolina primaries brought Gingrich 40 percent of the poll, while his main competitor, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney scored 27 percent The official GOP candidate to challenge Obama at the November election will be apparent by the summer The world of Russian politics has been concurrently heating up since the parliamentary election in December For the first time in many years, protest rallies attracted dozens of thousands in Moscow and several other cities across the country The surge in domestic debate in both countries came at a time of yet another chill in US Russia relations over global missile defense, as well as Russia s stubborn opposition to Washington s push for military intervention in Syria and Iran Putin met with Kissinger just six weeks ahead of Russia s presidential election, scheduled for 4 March 2012 Remarkably, Putin s own campaign team has been insisting that the White House was behind the recent protest rallies in Russia, sponsoring the opposition in the hope of an orangerevolution ù Russian senior government officials have also explicitly voiced their irritation with the actions of US Ambassador Michael McFaul, who had a meeting with Russian grassroots opposition leaders on January 18th The meeting was hosted by the US Embassy in Moscow, and attended by the Deputy Secretary of State, who was visiting Russia at the time This might have been the reason for Dr Kissinger s decision to have a private conversation with Ambassador McFaul one day short of his meeting with Vladimir Putin Mr McFaul mentioned his meeting with Henry Kissinger in his blog, adding that the former Secretary of State continues to work on promoting the crucially important dialogue on strategic partnership between our two nations ù Vladimir Putin has previously referred to Henry Kissinger on numerous occasions as a foreign policy expert whose opinions are highly valuable In his book published in 2000 and titled In the First Person: Talking to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader gives a glowing account of his first encounter with Kissinger in the early 1990s Kissinger strongly impressed Putin during their first conversation, telling him about his own background in intelligence He also opined that Mikhail Gorbachev s decision to withdraw Soviet troops from Eastern Europe in the late 1980s was premature, adding that he had never quite understood Gorbachev s motivation The one time chief of US diplomacy is still considered an outstanding expert in international relations today His credentials as one of the prime architects of the US Soviet d√©tente in the 1970s are the reason why his meeting with Vladimir Putin on January 20th focused primarily on promoting the dialogue between Moscow and Washington The Russian Prime Minister set the tone for the meeting, cordially addressing Kissinger in his welcoming speech: You and I have a long standing history of highly positive relations I consider you one of the most sophisticated foreign policy experts, including the area of US Russian relations ù Kissinger promptly returned the compliment The account of the meeting and its context invite a number of conclusions The meeting took place merely four days into Michael McFaul s tenure as US Ambassador to Russia, signifying acknowledgment of the fact that the two countries relations are strained and ridden with tension, which can possibly upset the balance of power, and have an adverse affect on stability, globally Kissinger s underlying task of reintroducing shuttle diplomacy to US Russia relations reveals that the two nations foreign policy makers have exhausted their options for compromise over the contentious missile defense issue, which is becoming ever more evident as both parties increasingly tend to resort to Cold War style rhetoric and accusations A clear cut example of the latter can be found in the recent public statement made by Russian Space Agency Director Vladimir Popovkin, who suggested that the US might be behind the mysterious crash of Russia s Phobos Grunt satellite The White House seems somewhat surprised by Russia s dramatically toughened attitude vis √† vis Washington s drive for a military operation against Syria or Iran The public statements circulated by the Russian Foreign Ministry and National Security Council on 12 January 2012 were reinforced by an impressive naval exercise performed by a Russian aircraft carrier group in the Mediterranean The wargame demonstrated Russia s growing military potential, as well as its readiness to step in to prevent a Western military gamble in the Middle East The Putin Kissinger meeting offered one of the few remaining opportunities to avoid a further escalation of tension between Russia and the United States It becomes even more meaningful once you consider that Vladimir Putin is an undisputed presidential frontrunner, while Henry Kissinger happens to be a foreign policy guru for GOP, whose candidate is highly likely to become America s next president, come November I am convinced that friendly relations based on mutual respect and a balance of interest would benefit both Russia and the United States I hope such meetings will continue and eventually contribute to easing the tension in US Russia relations Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor

current political situation is more balanced, thanks to his life experience Medvedev recalled the dramatic events of the early nineties Today there is some disorder, too Perhaps, in that sense I can t be entirely happy with what I ve done in the past four years, ù he confessed But I am confident that our country doesn t need any revolutions, ù Medvedev underlined The head of state pointed out that

convention of the United Russia party, Medvedev announced that he supported Vladimir Putin s candidacy for the forthcoming presidential election On November 27, a second party convention endorsed Putin s nomination Talking to young journalists on Wednesday, Medvedev said that even though he would not link this directly ù to his refusal to run for president, some protesters perhaps wanted the scenario to develop in a different way, and would rather see him taking part in the upcoming election But this time I really decided not to run for reasons of political suitability, because I thought that two people representing the same political force must not elbow each other The one who currently perhaps has slightly more chances of winning should go ahead, ù Medvedev said However, Medvedev does not plan to leave politics yet I ve never said that I will never run again Let me remind you, I m only 46 which isn t such a serious age as to refrain from further political battles, ù he observed The president also expressed his views on the recent parliamentary vote I have experience of observing elections since 1991 No matter how much criticism these elections received and there certainly were violations, some of them outrageous perhaps these were the cleanest elections in our history, ù Medvedev told the students At the same time, he said that we should work together on improving the electoral system, ù so that votes would give rise to fewer questions The president pointed out that there have always been, and will be election violations and attempts to falsify the results But we should ensure that everything is under public control, ù he said Medvedev also touched on Moscow Washington relations, saying they have not got worse, just as his relations with American President Barack Obama have not deteriorated He expressed hope that the new US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul will take into account the country s specific framework and act within his mandate Preliminary, my colleague Barack Obama informally came to agreement with me over this figure, ù Medvedev said The president added that he knows McFaul personally and feels he is a sensible ù person However, the Russian leader did not rule out that tensions between the two powers over the American missile defense system in Europe may worsen in the late 2010s Medvedev admitted that Russia and the US have serious differences on the planned defense shield Censorship in the media was also discussed at the meeting on Wednesday According to the president, this problem exists due to the large number of state media outlets in Russia In some cases, the state polishes the situation [in the media] This refers to both federal and regional media, ù he said As a possible solution, Medvedev

"13 Jan, 2012",Experts reserved as US sends 'reset architect' to Moscow,"Russian political experts say appointing Michael McFaul as ambassador to Moscow was clearly not the best choice of the US administration, but it is still too early to expect overt pressure and support of destabilizing forces from the diplomat s side The head of the Russian Institute of Strategic Assessments, Sergey Oznobishchev, told RIA Novosti that McFaul was not the best figure to represent the US interests, as the attitude to him in Russia was at worst restrained, and at best negative The analyst added that regardless of the objectives that lie behind the State Department s decision the appointment can be seen as a sign of the US side s unhappiness with the state of relations with Russia It is clear that many things that could be easily achieved with some other ambassador will be made difficult with this one, ù Oznobishchev added On the other hand, the head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, said that McFaul s appointment testified to the fact that the US side paid special attention to relations with Russia at the present moment He said that McFaul had worked in Moscow for a long time, personally knows many experts and politicians, and demonstrates very good knowledge of the international political situation Minchenko added that it was highly unlikely that the new ambassador would try to organize some sort of an orangerevolution ù in Russia If this was so, we would have scandals for a long time already, but so far there is nothing of this sort, ù the analyst said Minchenko added that President Barack Obama s administration cannot start criticizing Russia at the moment as this would mean that the whole previous course of the so called reset ù was wrong and it cannot be allowed in an elections year, and in the face of sharp criticism from the Republican Party Michael McFaul was sworn in on January 11 and will officially start working on his post on January 14 At the swearing in ceremony, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the relationship with Russia as the most complex and consequential ù the US has with any nation in the world Prior to his nomination, McFaul was Senior Director for the White House National Security Staff on Russia and Eurasia Affairs He is considered one of the architects of the reset ù in Russian US relations ",https://www.rt.com/russia/russian-experts-cautious-appointment-705/
"20 Dec, 2011",Michael McFaul and Russia‚Äôs Presidential Election,"Michael McFaul was appointed US Ambassador to Russia on 17 December 2011 Writer and political scientist Igor Panarin believes the new ambassador is likely to try to influence Russia s upcoming presidential election In the article below, Panarin explains his view Michael McFaul is a Stanford graduate with a Ph D in international relations from Oxford University He first visited Russia in 1983 and stayed for some time while studying for his Ph D at Oxford McFaul went on to spend several years living in Russia in the 1990s, working for the Carnegie Moscow Center President Obama s nomination of McFaul to serve as the US Ambassador to Moscow became public in May this year At the time, McFaul was Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs for the US National Security Council McFaul s candidacy was submitted to Congress for endorsement in September He would have started his work in Moscow as early as November 2011, during the final stages of Russia s recent parliamentary election, if not for the Republican Party, which barred his appointment twice for partisan reasons as it tried to gain an edge in the 2012 presidential campaign which is just heating up in the United States It was therefore due to the GOP s stubborn opposition that McFaul was unable to communicate the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s critical attitude vis √† vis the Russian election to the leaders of Russia s so called extra systemic ù opposition during the December protests in Moscow In fact, Mr McFaul himself must have a thing or two to say about Russia s democracy, being one of America s most prominent experts on Russia McFaul speaks fluent Russian and has authored and edited over 20 books on democratic governance A joint McFaul Surkov working group on civilsociety [ Vladislav Surkov has held the post of first deputy of the Presidential Administration since 2008 and is believed to be one of the most influential politicians in Russia and the main architect of the country s current political system † RT ] was set up in July 2009 through a joint decree by the Russian and US presidents In this capacity, McFaul had an extensive opportunity to meet Russian human rights advocates, opposition leaders and prominent press people In 2002, McFaul founded a Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford University He is still among the Center s faculty today, which is why it was especially interesting for me to visit the Center in late November this year and discuss prospects for US Russia relations post 2012 with its leading analysts It should be noted that the political school of thought created by Michael McFaul looks very impressive, as it comprises foreign policy professionals and reputed experts on Russia and the post Soviet space McFaul s team of experts is proficient in using political technologies and PR strategies, and it shares a strong focus on promoting democracy ù in Russia These policy makers have developed their own vision of what democracy should be like in Russia, and are ready to offer their recipes to Russia s liberal opposition but in a soft and subtle way As soon as Russia was through with its parliamentary election this December, a number of American and British news outlets launched a media offensive against it As part of the smear campaign, FOX News ran footage of the Greek riots featuring arson and looting for several days, trying to pass it off as Moscow s post election protests One should expect that McFaul s arrival in Moscow is bound to increase the media pressure on Russia s leaders, since the American and British political elites are keen on preventing Vladimir Putin from assuming office for another term It is only the tactics that are likely to change with McFaul as ambassador McFaul is aware of the Russian extra systemic ù opposition s major advantages and downsides He earlier contributed to the creation of a network of Western funded NGOs in Russia This makes him a highly efficient advisor when it comes to promoting democracy ù in Russia In the meantime, there are plenty of human rights activists in Russia who are ready and waiting to upload sensational ù footage of alleged electoral fraud on the Internet in order to discredit Russia s upcoming presidential election New political technologies have been successfully tested during the recent unrest in the Middle East What Professor McFaul is going to do now is fine tune them to the Russian situation and to the presidential election campaign in particular We can expect Michael McFaul to make his big move as early as late January 2012 Is the Russian government ready for this?
