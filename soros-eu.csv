"25 Sep, 2019",God Save Our Queen: Elizabeth R dragged into the Brexit Imbroglio (by George Galloway),"Britain never had a Supreme Court in the way it never had a Constitution Yet somehow the

maker, writer and a renowned orator †Follow him †on Twitter@georgegalloway was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT) He is a film maker, writer and a renowned orator †Follow him †on Twitter@georgegalloway When I was serving for nearly 30 years in the British Parliament, the Law Lords shared a rickety corridor and a single secretary high above the chamber of the House of Lords They were the final court of appeal, all of them members of parliament, albeit by appointment rather than election Before Tony Blair set up a separate Supreme Court (who else would be responsible for the distinctly un common law modernisation of a US style Supreme Court ), † the delicate balance between legislature, executive courts and Crown was something to behold A Heath Robinson Affair no doubt But it worked The seismic re writing of an un written constitution by 11 unelected unremovable justices over the prorogation of parliament effectively abolishes the Royal Prerogative exercised by British Prime Ministers for centuries It begins the unravelling of the notion that the PM and the Government represent the Queen in Parliament and on matters in which parliament itself does not preclude them, can exercise executive authority From now on, many, maybe most things, will be ultimately decided not in parliament by elected MPs but in courts by unelected judges Judicial Review just went nuclear This may be a good thing, it may be a bad thing, but it cannot be denied, that no parliament ever agreed to this un elective surgery Thus the constitution of the country has been radically re shaped without a vote being cast Adding insult to injury, the state itself will pay the costs of the case through legal aid The irony is that Boris Johnson s ill fated prorogation of parliament for around an extra week than would be normal at this time of the year and this stage of a parliament served him no purpose whatsoever and this would have been the case even if he had won the case If, as the Court decided, Johnson had set out to stymie (a Scottish Golfing term meaning to frustrate) well he plainly didn t succeed No sooner than he announced it the Benn Burt Bill passed through both Houses of Parliament in record quick time which trussed him up like a turkey, forcing him to abandon his No Deal Brexit negotiating strategy with the EU and to beg them for another three month extension of British membership for starters It is true that the prime minister set out to frustrate the ability of the parliament to stymie him But it is also true that the parliament itself has set out to frustrate the decision of the British people to leave the EU And not for a week but for three long years Although both sides made clear in the Brexit referendum that the people s decision would be final, then jointly triggered Article 50 which set the clock ticking towards exit, then jointly stood for election in 2017 in Theresa May s foolhardily unnecessary election promising to respect the result of the referendum, the narrow outcome of that election put Brexit in trouble from the beginning of this parliament It is a parliament overwhelmingly Remain at heart which gradually recovered its confidence to frustrate the electorate Its confidence was richly boosted by the support of the richest people in the land (indeed the world everyone from George Soros to the American banks have had their tuppence worth ), the deep state, the EU itself, the financial sector (virtually unanimously), international capital (as opposed to the much smaller national bourgeoisie ) and most of the printed media and all of the broadcast media A cacophony of clamour to stop Brexit by hook or by crook has steadily grown and the court case is merely a part of this No one can now predict where this goes The prime minister s efforts to force a new election to change the parliamentary arithmetic seems doomed to fail Thanks to the fixed term parliaments act two thirds of MPs have to vote for an early election The opposition cry simultaneously Tories Out and Tories In by virtue of their refusal to allow an election Ably assisted by the Speaker of the House the rebels are now in charge of the parliament and can, for now, do as they will They may force Johnson or a replacement non partisan prime minster to seek an extension which by the terms of the Benn Burt Bill can be at the pleasure of the EU as to its duration Or they may drunk on success seek to revoke Article 50 altogether and remove the clock thus effectively returning the whole matter to the status quo ante But the people of England have not spoken yet Wales voted for Brexit, Scotland did not But England voted overwhelmingly for Brexit The political class are counting on ennui wearing down the Brexit 17 4 million by the passage of time and literally years of scaremongering Project Fear My own experience in the Midlands and the North (I spend my weekends in one or the other) suggests that this whole series of betrayals has hardened resolve rather than weakened it My own feeling is that the electorate will exact a terrible vengeance on the politicians when the time finally comes to face them And that if they fail even then, Britain and British democracy will never be the same again And I don t mean that in a good way A terrible beauty may be born Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won t tell you ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/469574-boris-johnson-supreme-court-brexit/

This list of demands by western funded Ukraine NGOs îthreatening to overthrow Zelenskiy if he doesn t follow their demands îperfect example of Arundhati Roy s critique of civilsociety as an elite construct designed to subvert & control popular democracyhttps:// tdotco /j33iGoSqOA Of course, these groups do indeed represent various factions of Ukrainian society and many of them no doubt have worthy aims, and they should continue their work unimpeded But they do not represent all of Ukrainian society and they certainly do not have the authority to set the political agenda and lay down the law to the incoming government and that, quite literally, is what they are trying to do It s such a gobsmackingly odd list of demands that even Western journalists who had a broadly friendly relationship with the Poroshenko government are aghast at their audacity The list is broken down into issues of security, foreign policy, economy, national identity (language, education and culture), media and government functioning On security, the groups want to forbid Zelensky from achieving compromise with Russia in any manner that would be to the detriment of the national interest, presumably as defined by themselves Inhibiting the implementation of security and defense policies outlined in a 2016 decree signed by Poroshenko is also forbidden, they say do these cronies not know how democracy works, or just not care? Three quarters of the country voted against their agenda they don t get to continue setting it like the election never happened In the foreign policy realm, these audacious activists warn that democratically elected Zelensky may not initiate any actions that could lead to the reduction or lifting of sanctions on Russia by Western powers He may not take any action delaying, sabotaging, or rejecting the course for EU and NATO membership for Ukraine Where the economy is concerned, he may not implement any policy that goes against existing agreements with the IMF and other foreign partners It s on the national identity front that things get really sketchy, though The groups would like to forbid any attempt whatsoever to even review ù multiple controversial laws signed by Poroshenko, including an anti Russia language law (which effectively alienates the 30 percent of Ukrainians who speak Russian as their native tongue) and laws on contentious de communization ù which banned Soviet symbols in the country Ironically, this push for de communization coincided with a renewed glorification of Nazism that went almost unnoticed by Western media and officials, who have supported Poroshenko s virulently anti Russian government as it implemented laws better suited to George Orwell s 1984 than a modern democracy The NGOs ùinsist that Zelensky may not implement any action to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, another red line among their national identity demands Remember when Russian television channels and social networks like VKontakte were banned in Ukraine simply for the crime of being Russian? Well, Zelensky will also be in big trouble if he tries to restore them, the civilsociety groups ùsay READ MORE: Reality bites: Ukraine s President Zelensky puts showbiz pals in positions of real power The most vague red line of all comes near the end of the list, when the new president is warned against ignoring dialogue with civilsociety ù a command so vague that almost anything ùZelensky does going forward could be interpreted as ignoring their wishes, France 24 correspondent Gulliver Cragg wrote on Twitter BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher tweeted that the groups themselves may have crossed a red line †the red line of what civilsociety groups can legitimately demand of a freshly elected government I feel like almost anything he does could be interpreted as crossing one or other of those lines, they re so wide ranging It reads like a manifesto there s an election in 2 months Make a party see if anyone agrees with you that s democracy Zelensky was elected to office with 73 percent of the vote and let s not forget, he won that election having campaigned against many of the policies these civilsociety groups are aggressively demanding be kept in place He has been in office only a matter of days, and these Western backed groups are threatening to instigate political unrest should he take any action that they don t find acceptable to their political agenda So who, exactly, poses the real threat to democracy?

"22 May, 2019",Is Soros-linked Avaaz group a credible source on fake news? Mainstream media seems to think so,"Mainstream news outlets have eagerly reported on a study by the Avaaz campaign group, claiming far right disinformation groups have been spreading fake news in the lead up to EU elections î but is the group all that it seems? The Avaaz network bills itself as social action group bringing people powered politics to decision making everywhere ùand it s lateststudyclaims that more than 500 suspicious groups and Facebook pages are operating across major EU countries and spreading election disinformation to boost far right and anti EU parties ahead of crucial parliamentary elections The disinformation networks, Avaaz claimed, are even more popular than the pages belonging to official right wing and anti establishment groups and parties î and that they have been engaged in everything from sharing white supremacist content to Holocaust denial Be like Captain Von Trapp reject the far right!#EUElections2019are next week EU voters can RT to say:#YesWeVoteMay 23 26!pic twitter com/8BT02XrD8P Outlets from the Washington Post in the US to the Guardian in the UK have reported on the study, which was released just days before Europeans go to the polls î but reading the reports gives a clear impression that Avaaz is a non partisan and independent group, when the reality is much different Avaaz is not simply studying these elections, it is actively campaigning While Avaaz claims it accepts no money from governments or corporations, it is tied to other social action groups Res Publica and Moveon org (which has been partly funded by left wing Hungarian American billionaire George Soros) î and its co founders, Ricken Patel and Tom Perriello, have a history of supporting a US imperialist agenda Patel has previously worked for the US State Department and Amnesty International, while Perriello is a former US congressman who voted in favor of continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Soros was also a major campaign contributor to Perriello Is this really the kind of political action group that should be cited by the media without proper context? Independent journalists have had suspicions about Avaaz s own activity for years, noting its strong pro establishment and globalist leanings, which have even translated into outward support for US regime change wars around the world When the group is notpushingfor no fly zones in LibyaandSyria, oragitatingfor regime change in Venezuela and Iran, it is actively supporting centrist, neoliberal political figures across the EU and US Patel told the EUobserver last year that the majority ùof people across Europe stand with ùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and has also activelysupportedFrench President Emmanuel Macron with online videos and petitions While Avaaz is seemingly very concerned with the plight of citizens in places like Venezuela and Iran (it was also activelyinvolvedin promoting Iran s Green Revolution in 2009), it appears to be less concerned with the lives of ordinary Europeans The group has targeted the anti Macron Yellow Vest movement in France and †framed the protesters easy targets for spreading fake news ù î and to put the icing on the cake, blamed the swift spread of this alleged fake news on Russia, another of Avaaz s favorite targets Indeed, unsurprisingly, media reporting on so called election meddling ahead of EU elections has taken on an anti Russia hue, with many suggesting that disinformation groups are simply copying Russian tactics from the 2016 US election, when the democraticparty claimed Russian disinformation campaigns were a major factor in Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump î a claim for which there remains exactly zero evidence One of these reports on the alleged copycat tactics quotes Ben Nimmo, a former NATO press officer, cited with regularity by mainstream journalists as though he is an impartial source Like clockwork, Nimmo popped up ahead of the EU elections to claim that domestic actors ùacross Europe are now simply doing what the Russians had already been doing ù î because it s easier to blame Russia for social discord in Europe than failed leadership and unpopular policies Once again, it appears that many of the groups claiming to help people recognize fake news online are some of the biggest and sneakiest purveyors of disinformation themselves î and they are frequently promoted by mainstream news outlets î if they are selling the correct narrative, that is Mainstream media continue to quote the founders of cybersecurity firm New Knowledge as credible experts on Russian disinformation tactics, even after the firm wasexposedby the New York Times for having run its own disinformation campaign during a 2017 Alabama senate race The New Knowledge crowd set up fake Russian social media accounts to support one candidate and then worked to publicly brand him as Moscow s pick By not even mentioning Avaaz s own sketchy links, and very clear political leanings, Western news reports citing its studies as completely credible and independent are simply engaging in their own kind of disinformation ",https://www.rt.com/news/460010-avaaz-eu-elections-disinformation/

The answer is probably somewhat Unlike its uber liberal neighbor Sweden, Denmark has reacted to the influx of refugees and migrants with increasing hostility The coalition government made up of the center right Venstre and further right Danish People s Party has passed laws requiring refugees to hand over jewelry and valuables to finance their stay, banned the burqa in public, and planned to ship rejected asylum seekers to an uninhabited island in the Baltic sea If you are unwanted in Danish society, you should not be a nuisance to ordinary Danes, ù Immigration Minister Inger St√∏jberg stated when announcing the island plan They are undesirable in Denmark and they must feel it! ù St√∏jberg has been a key author of her government s anti immigration policies In March 2018, she marked the passing of her 50th anti immigration measure by celebrating with a cake decorated with fruit, the Danish flag, and the number 50 #DanishMinister for#Integration(!)

"27 Apr, 2019","Who checks the fact-checkers? Facebook leaves verification to groups funded by Soros, US Congress","In its crusade against fake news , Facebook has vowed to fight for impartiality However, when it comes to fact checking, it seems to rely on sources, which have links to the US government, and renowned political meddlers For more than two years, the social media giant has been seeking to convince the public that it does its best to take a stand against malicious disinformation spread through its network and presented a whole bunch of instruments aimed at revealing and countering false narratives It appears, though, that Facebook heavily relies on decisions taken by some third parties in its anti disinformation policy Submissions from the so called fact checkers alongside some feedback from users seemto be the primary source on which Facebook relies when saying a post is false Facebook proudly boasted that all the partners it cooperates with were certified through what it calls the non partisan International Fact Checking Network or IFCN However, the social network s choice of people to trust with the power to decide what is true or false does raise questions This seemingly impressive international network Facebook mentions is a projectrunby Florida based private school of journalism the Poynter Institute for Media Studies The project, which Facebook apparently uses as a sole instrument to find trustworthy partners, seems to be way more than just a selfless initiative aimed at helping people navigate through questionable information The IFCN waslaunchedin 2015 following a generous donation totaling $300,000, which the Poynter Institute received from two sources One of them is the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) a soft power organization, which is funded primarily through annual allocations from the US Congress Another one is the Omidyar Network a foundation run by the eBay founder and self described progressive billionaire Pierre Omidyar Although he has not yet apparently gained as much fame or infamy for that matter as another US billionaire and renowned political meddler, George Soros, Omidyar has also lately shown himself as a major patron of regime change operations As early as in 2014, the US mediareportedthat Omidyar supported anti government groups in Ukraine that opposed the then President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted during Maidan A report by Forbes alsosuggestedthat the billionaire was one of the major funders of the Kiev based Hromadske TV, which harbored anti Russian views while backing the violent 2014 coup Most recently, a group of

Democracy Fund another foundation linked to the eBay founder on its list of major donors, alongside opensociety Foundations (OSF) run by Soros and the NED The list of certified fact checkers provided by the IFCN certainly looks impressive It includes such international news agencies as Associated Press and Agency France Press (AFP), which appear on the list along with its branch offices in a dozen and a half countries In total, the network describes 66 organizations as verified signatories of the self styled code of principles itdeveloped However, the impartiality question remains At least some of the organizationslistedas reliable suppliers of the ultimate truth and described as partners by Facebook in fact receive substantial funding from the likes of Soros and Omidyar or even directly from Western governments One of these organizations called PolitiFact evenenjoyswhat it calls administrative support from the Poynter Institute while receiving significant funding from Facebook itself The US based fact checker also collected regular donations from Omidyar s Democracy Fund since at least 2013, which amounted to between $125,000 and $250,000 Across the pond, the British Full Fact

"29 Mar, 2019",Left opt for election scaremongering? Report claims ‚ÄòUS dark money‚Äô meddling in Europe,"A new alarming report claims American Christian conservative groups funneled millions to fund shocking ù meddling in European politics Seems like a big scoop, or just a ploy to sway European Parliament elections? Thereportreleased by the UK based political website openDemocracy this week spares no black paint to produce a picture of gross interference in European affairs The perpetrators are conservative Christian charities, which, the records show, pumped at least $50 million into European countries All the right names that can scare a left leaning reader are duly mentioned Donald Trump? Check Vladimir Putin? Check Steve Bannon? Check, three times Also listed are billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the DeVos family, including Blackwater founder Erik Prince, and the evangelical preacher Franklin †Graham who notably travelled to Russia earlier this month, the report stressed for some arcane reason #Collusion? I m in Russia right now îMoscow to be exact îand I m meeting with the Russian churches on how we can share with more young people about faith in Jesus Christ!

"22 Mar, 2019",Hungary‚Äôs FM: We didn‚Äôt get suspended; we chose to suspend our EPP membership,"The European People s Party, the center right group within the European Parliament, has suspended Hungary s Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban Is this the beginning of a major rift within the union? We talked to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto Follow@SophieCo_RT Podcasthttps://soundcloud com/rttv/sets/sophieco Sophie Shevardnadze: Peter Szijjarto, Hungarian Foreign Minister, great to have you with us again, you re always a very welcome guest on our show Peter Szijjarto: Thank you for the invitation SS: And this time around, we have lots of news to discuss, because Hungary is once again making the top charts when it comes to the news So, the bloc of the centre right parties in the European Parliament, the European People s Party, has voted to suspend your ruling party, Fidesz Is it a very big blow to your party? What does it mean, and why would they do it, because it would seem like they need support for the May s elections? PS: Look, because Because, you have to understand that migration rules the agenda of the europeanunion as such, when it comes to politics or policies, and EPP, being the largest political family, coming from the right reaching out to central left, basically, you have very colorful set of parties, and that s why the migration there is an issue when it comes to the debates, and the position of different parties on migration differs And our position is a very strong anti migration position, which is not shared by many And since migration became the number one issue of European politics, it definitely raises emotions, tensions, very strong feelings and very strong announcements So that s why this is the core of the conflict SS: That s where the misunderstanding is, because for people from the outside, EPP is the centre right party, and, you know, logically, they would be supporting the same migration policies as Fidesz would, but you re saying it s much larger of a spectrum, not just centre right, because we get an impression that it s a center right bloc Ok, so that makes sense PS: And you should know also, one more thing, I am sorry to interfere, but you should not forget the fact that after the recent number of European Parliament elections, the EPP and the Socialist group had to make, as they call, a technical type of coalition, but a coalition for sure, in order to create a majority in the European Parliament And if you, let s say, govern together with a party family coming from the other side of the political spectrum, that shapes you And we have to be honest, European People s Party was shaped by this coalition in the last decades a lot, so the core of the EPP s position moved, you know, towards the left from where it used to be SS: So, this suspension happened, took place The head of your Prime Minister s office has said that if suspension happens, that means that Fidesz is leaving the EPP What s going on right now? PS: Yes, but then, the decision was a little bit different than that, because in English, you say that we were suspended, but we were suspended by ourselves, meaning that before the vote on whether to suspend or exclude Fidesz, we have announced that we suspend ourselves, we step back, we basically say that we put our rights in the EPP on hold, and there is going to be a body of three persons appointed by the European People s Party, smart, experienced politicians who used to be high ranking officials of their given countries, and even the European institutions, and they will make a report about whether Fidesz s values, Fidesz s actions are in line with the EPP charter, let s put it this way And in the meantime, we have set up a body as well, three persons, who make a report whether it makes sense to remain in the EPP SS: So what could be the consequence? From what I understand, the vote didn t take place, you suspended yourself before the vote, right? So there was no vote PS: The vote was about this consensual outcome that Fidesz suspends itself SS: So that means, that if it wasn t voted in, and it was your choice to suspend yourselves, they cannot put any pressure on your further policies? PS: Well, they cannot put pressure on our policies anyhow SS: I mean that was the whole idea behind this, right, if they were to suspend PS: Yeah We are a sovereign party, you know, and we are held responsible by our voters back in Hungary So what we want to do, and what we have been doing is satisfying the expectations of the Hungarian people based on the will of whom we are governing SS: So what would this consequence into for your country? Could EU s payouts to Hungary be under threat? What can happen? PS: No no no We shouldn t confuse the party issue with, let s say, institutional questions The issue you raise, regarding the EU funds, is a very unfair debate, because many times we, the Central European countries, the so called newcomers, I mean a long time ago, but the so called Central European newcomers are usually portrayed in a very unfair way, as if we were only taking the benefit out of the europeanunion , like a cash machine, you know, and don t take responsibility for anything, which is absolutely not true, unfair and can be taken into consideration as an insult Because we have fulfilled our obligations, with opening our markets, allowing Western European companies to come there to take profit, take the profit out of the country So 70% of the European funds paid to Central European countries basically go back to the Western European countries through their companies So portraying us as being the net benefitters of all of these funds with no merit is simply unfair SS: So you re saying the payouts are not under threat? PS: Well, the payouts are based on contracts and and treaties, and if someone wants to change the treaties, must go through a very complicated and very long legal procedure, because the treaties can only be opened by consensus of 28, or 27 soon, and can be closed by the consensus of 27 or 28 in the future as well So it s a very complicated thing, so there can be communication turbulences around that, but if you look deeply to the substance, then it must be a very complicated and a long lasting debate or legal procedure SS: So just to sum up this, this suspension topic, right, it was caused in the beginning, it was ignited, triggered by the anti migrant policy that your country s leading, and also attacks on George Soros, those banners we ve all seen Do you think what has happened could anyhow be a drawback for Orban s home policy? Could it somehow affect Orban s policy? PS: No, no definitely not Because we are serving the national interest, and regardless of any kind of pressure in the past, we have always served the national interest, and that s going to be the case in the future as well And when it comes to George Soros, we have not attacked him, we have a debate with him A very serious debate, because the vision he has about the future of Europe, and the vision he has about the future of Hungary is dangerous, harmful, and we don t want that to happen So it s a debate with him, an open debate He openly wanted to throw the government, and we got into an open debate with him And my question is, why shouldn t a government go into an open debate, considering that we represent the people of Hungary SS: Okay, so let s see how the forces could be re arranged, because now we have Italy and Poland, and they have actually been building a Eurosceptic alliance under the banner of Renaissance of the true European values That was unexpected for many, because Poland used to be so pro EU, and now it s kind of siding with Italy against Is this idea result in forming another bloc within the European Parliament, a bloc on the right wing, is it a good thing, and would Fidesz actually considered joining that? PS: Look, I don t think it s fair to consider either the current government of Poland or Italy as an anti European or Eurosceptic, as you said, sorry Because you have to understand, there is a debate in the europeanunion SS: Integration, let s put it this way PS: Yeah, yeah, right There s a debate about the future of EU, which way to go forward And there are definitely at least two different camps One camp says that we need to reach to a situation where a United States of Europe is created, meaning weakened member states, stronger Brussels We think it s a dead end street We think this is a bad concept We think that this will not strengthen europeanunion What we think is, that EU can only be strong if the member states are themselves strong So urging for strong member states is not a Eurosceptic position, urging for strong member states is a pro European position, as we think that the way towards a strong europeanunion leads through strong member states, which stick to their national identities, which stick to the traditions, to the cultural heritage, Christian heritage We should not forget about all this, because if we distance ourselves, if we forget about our roots, our heritage, then we cannot be strong So the debate is rather about that, and that s why I think that this kind of, you know, expressions like Eurosceptic, whatever, do not describe the situation properly, because we are not eurosceptic, we are in favor of a strong europeanunion , but we think that SS: What would you call yourselves in one word? I mean, it s not Eurosceptic, I agree with you, because you re all part of europeanunion , you want to be part of europeanunion , but, like you said, there s definitely two camps One is super pro integration, like you said, strong Brussels and less stronger states, and you re pro stronger state and a formal Brussels, let s put it this way So if Italy and Poland do create this bloc within the European Parliament, and you ve suspended yourself from the EPP, would you consider joining it? PS: Well, what will happen after elections, I cannot give a prediction there We will make a decision which group to belong to, of course, because we have to wait for the reports of the two bodies, and we ll see how we go forward But the most important thing is, regarding the future European Parliament, well beyond party borders, is to move towards a more anti immigration position than currently, because currently the European Parliament is an extremely and radically pro migration body And this is something that we don t like SS: So you re leading me to my next question, because that has already been in the news You said Brussels is intending to weaken the EU s border protection against migrants, and is lying to the public when it comes to the border situation This is a serious accusation PS: These are facts, basically SS: I was going to ask: do you have a fact, do you have a proof? PS: Look, those leaders who are now trying to shine up as leaders in favor of stronger border protection, they are exactly the same ones who put enormous attack on Hungary in 2015, when we built the fence on our southern border Let s look at the Internet, at what they have said You know, they have put expressions on us which were really disgusting And now the very same people are speaking in favor of a strong border protection Not credible! Absolutely not credible! And then the organisation, you might heard the nameFrontex,is being mentioned Look, Frontex is a travel agency, it s not a border protection unit They speak about, you know, 10000 people to be put together But protecting the entire border to the South of the europeanunion with 10000 people? If someone says that, he doesn t know what he or she speaks about We needed to mobilise thousands of policemen and military personnel to be able to protect the fence at our Southern border, which is 550 kilometers long So in order to be able to protect the whole Southern border, including maritime and land border, the solution is not Frontex The solution is strong national obligations, so that the member states should take seriously into consideration their obligation to protect their borders Look, we are member of Schengen area, and the Schengen code says very clearly that if you are located at the external border, it is your obligation to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, with the proper documentation during opening hours So every members of the Schengen area should take this seriously into consideration, and if someone fails, then the membership should be suspended SS: Ok, so I m going to play a little bit of devil s advocate, and I m going to tell you what the opposite side is saying The European Commission has immediately dismissed your claims, and they re saying it s ludicrous, and it s a conspiracy theory, and they re actually saying that EU states are responsible for managing their own border policies, and they can decide how many immigrants come in and stay Judging from that argument, does it mean that you feel like you re not in control of your border in Hungary? Do you feel like it s under threat? I just want to hear that PS:Whether the borders are under threat? SS: Do you feel like you re not in control of your own border? PS:We are in control That s why we have built the fence That s why we have instructed the military personnel and police to be there But there are attempts to break in or break through the fence on a daily basis A number of them So we need to be tough there, and we are strict, and we have the control over our border But, you know, it s really not serious when the European Commission speaks about that, because the European Commission was the one to push the obligatory quota initiative forward, wanting to take away, intending to take away a sovereign right from the countries to decide on their own whom they would like to let enter the territory of their own countries, and with whom they would like to live together We think it s a core national competence, to make a decision whom we would like to let enter the territory of our country, and with whom we would like to live together No one else, no European Commission, no Brussels, no New York, no one should take away any kind of such a right from the member states SS:So there is another thing that has happened recently, the European Court for Justice ruled that Germany is authorised to deport failed asylum seekers and illegals to other EU states, and that means that they would send those people back to the EU states that they originally entered PS:Absolutely SS:That s your country as well PS:But this cannot be our country It s physically excluded SS:OK But a lot of people entry EU through Hungary PS:But that was not the case, because no one could physically It was impossible to have Hungary as the first entry point, because the people who ended up in Germany and went through Hungary came to Hungary either through Croatia, which is an EU member state, either through Serbia, but to Serbia, they got from Macedonia, and to Macedonia they got from Greece So everybody, all those 400000 illegal migrants who marched through the country of ours back in 2015, came through at least one or two EU member states before entering Hungary either Greece or Greece and Croatia Now the reason why the Germans wanted to send them back to us, but we made it very clear, no way, we won t receive any of them, was that we registered them, and the Greek didn t But not fulfilling an obligation of yours must not let you be not responsible for what you have done, meaning that regardless of the fact that the Greek have registered these migrants or not, they were the first entry point, and the treaties speak very clearly, that the first entry point is the responsible one SS:Another thing Manfred Weber, the EPP leader who could actually replace Juncker very soon, he wants to create this independent body, independent from the European Parliament, that would check the EU members domestic commitment to rule of law and, obviously, Hungary is the top goal Do you think that could come into completion, that plan? PS:Look, I think after the elections, it will be more rational to speak about these things, because, first, there should be a majority put together in the European Parliament Then we don t know the composition of that We don t know the composition of the European Commission So all these plans are, I mean, they sound nice, they sound exciting in the campaign period, but we have to wait until the election happens Now, when it comes to the rule of law issues in the europeanunion , what we see is a huge set of double standards Why? Take the example of Poland The Polish are under procedure because of their decisions regarding their judicial system Look, the European Commission put forward a list of decisions they should have made They completed all of them from A to Z And what European Commission has done was saying Äúoh, it s not enough, we continue the procedure Äù instead of stopping it and, you know, closing the file and putting it in the drawer So the problem is that there are double standards, hypocrisy, political correctness, and at many times political motivations SS:So I want to talk a little about Hungary s stance on immigration and Islamisation, because that s something that your country speaks very strongly about For instance, your Prime Minister has said that imposing pro immigration policies and Islamisation would actually break up the europeanunion If that happens, if the pro immigration sentiment persists, would Hungary actually consider leaving the bloc? PS:No, absolutely not That s not in question SS:So I just have a few polls here, Pew says in 2016, only about 5 percent of Europe s population was Muslim And then even the most generous forecasts see that in 2050 only 14 percent of Europe will be Muslim I mean, talking about Islamisation of Europe with those numbers is a little far fetched, no? He sees it as a very serious threat, but the polls say different PS:Well, first of all, I want to tell you that we are a Christian Democratic government, and being Christian as a person and being Christian Democrat as a politician means that you must not be anti anything So we are not anti Muslim We are not anti anything We are in favor of protecting the Christian culture and the Christian heritage of Europe And I can tell you that it was like 4 years ago when I first was challenged by my negotiating partner when I said that Europe is a Christian continent You know, it s unbelievable that you are challenged for that sentence, that shouldn t be the case Europe is a Christian continent with the Judeo Christian heritage, with its Christian culture And in this regard, I think it s very harmful and dangerous that there are forces suggesting that we should forget about this Christian heritage of ours Look, there were decisions made in the Western part of Europe forcing the Christian symbols to be taken off from public institutions, or there was even a French decision to take off the cross from the top of the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II I mean, this is unbelievable and this is something that we should not tolerate SS:I know you don t like Frontex, but I m still going to give you some numbers from that, because a few weeks ago your Prime Minister warned of a second migrant crisis that could be hitting Europe, worse than in 2015, but in January, Frontex says that 2018 was the lowest number of illegal crossings into Europe since six years What are you guys, so worried about, especially that, you know, most of the newcomers are actually heading towards Sweden, Germany, not Hungary, really? PS:You know, there are 30 to 35 million people, according to estimates, around the europeanunion , mostly in the Southern and Southern Eastern neighborhood, who are either living on the daily humanitarian aid, either are living as internally displaced persons already, or already are on the move thirty to thirty five million, who can easily make a decision to hit the road towards Europe I was in Jordan recently The 1 3 million refugees put enormous burden on the shoulder of the Jordanian state, on the Hashemite Kingdom Lebanon the situation is worse and worse there because of the burden being put on the shoulders of the Lebanese with the refugees there The last time the Turkish President has complained about the europeanunion not paying the agreed sum of money to fulfill or to comply with the EU Turkey deal on migration As you talk to the ministers of interior of the Western Balkan countries, they will let you know that the influx is getting more and more serious The foreign terrorist fighters are making attempts to return In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 27 to 28 thousand illegal migrants getting stuck On our border, we register a growing number of attempts to break in or, using vehicles, to squeeze in somehow Talk to the Serbs, talk to the Croats they ll let you know that the influx is there on a continuous basis, not to speak about the fact that Mr Salvini was attacked by not allowing the illegal migrants to enter Italy and disembark the ships So the problem is that Europe got again very comfortable, and instead of building the capacities to be able to protect ourselves, we basically have done nothing I mean, on the level of europeanunion , we still cannot protect the maritime border, the number of trespassers on the land border between Turkey and Greece is increasing So there is a threat of a next big wave, because the policy of the europeanunion is still kind of considered as an invitation in the mindset of those people who are in a situation that they can make a decision to to leave and to come to Europe SS:Okay, I get your point Now to a different topic the Russian led International Investment Bank is moving to Budapest, changing headquarters Hungary is the top contributor with the lowest number of loans What s the calculus behind it? What s the logic?

"14 Feb, 2019","Europe banked on George Soros instead of Viktor Orban, and will suffer the consequences ‚Äì forever","A clash of ideas is occurring in Europe between Hungarian PM Viktor Orban and financier George Soros that will impact the continent forever But Brussels is only interested in considering one option the Soros option Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In any other period of European history, Viktor Orban would have been heralded as a noble statesman by many of his peers The reason is rather straightforward He is attempting to do exactly what other European leaders have done for centuries before him, and that is defending the continent from foreign incursions But these are radical new times and the old rules no longer apply By now, most people are familiar with the mainstream media s narrative on Europe s plight Millions of desperate migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, suffering the untold ravages of war and poverty, are streaming towards Europe s borders in a quest for some semblance of peace and happiness There is a lot of truth to that narrative; millions of innocent people have had their lives totally upended by senseless wars sparked by Western regime change operations They deserve not only sympathy but physical assistance At the same time, however, Europeans are expected to sacrifice everything to assist these new arrivals regardless of the cost And the cost is nothing less than exorbitant InGermany, for example, asylum seekers are entitled to as much as 354 ($400) per month, while the state picks up the tab for rent and medical insurance All told, Germany isexpectedto fork out hold onto your hat 77 6 billion ($86 2 billion) during the period from 2017 to 2020 on feeding, housing and training their new guests In light of that massive assistance, is it any wonder that over one million people crashed Germany s paper border in 2015 alone? This leads us to an obvious question that the Western media never discusses: Would this great migration of people have occurred without the promise of generous handouts by European capitals? It seems that without some sort of security net in place, the majority of these people would not have risked such ahazardousjourney Moreover, there are huge budgetary considerations that cannot be ignored (yet are), for as any economist knows, money does not grow on trees This is Sweden Around 15 cars were set on fire in the city of G√§vle tonight 5 women sexually assaulted in Uppsala this weekend Also, there was 4 bombings in 24 hours This is not the Sweden I used to knowüò≠pic twitter com/f1Oqfr0YYT George Soros, the head of opensociety Foundations, believes he has that problem figured out To finance it, heexplainedcasually, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later Really? Well, judging by the Yellow Vest protests occurring on a weekly basis in the French capital, initially sparked by the imposition of a new fuel tax, we have some good indication as to how enthusiastic Europeans will be for such a plan In short, not very The questions don t end there How is it possible that George Soros has been able to sell his unproven and very expensive plan for open borders to the European people? We can take some guidance from the pithy expression Money talks In that case, nobody has done more talking in Europe than Soros Over the years, the billionaire has assembled some 226 reliableallies in the European Parliament to promote his vision of a brave new Europe This cozy arrangement allowed his opensociety European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the EU policy arm of opensociety Foundations, tomeetwith members of the European Commission on 65 separate occasions last year alone It s probably safe to say that those closed door meetings had no small impact on the political landscape of Europe Enter Viktor Orban, the bane of Brussels, who is playing a role in European history that cannot be overestimated The leader of fiercely independent Hungary has taken a zero tolerance approach to illegal immigration,refusingto permit a single illegal immigrant to enter his country Meanwhile, other eastern European countries Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which, together with Hungary, form the anti immigration Visegrad Group have takensimilarsteps At the same time, across Europe right wing parties aresurgingin popularity In direct defiance of Brussels, Orban has ordered the construction of a barbed wire fence that runs along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia, a project that the mainstream media somehowconflateswith authoritarianism, as if the concept of national borders never existed before in history OrbansentBrussels a bill for half the cost of the fence, but it was never paid, of course That s too bad, because it could have been the smartest money the EU ever spent, since it would have spared Europeans the influx of mass illegal immigration The Hungarian leader has other ideas that Brussels will probably not be considering any time soon, like ways of addressing Europe s dire demographic problem This month, Orban announced a raft of new tax and loan incentives for families as part of government efforts to boost the birth rate without depending on immigration flows to accomplish that goal There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration, hesaidin his annual state of the nation speech We need Hungarian children The plan has some merit Mothers will be eligible for a 10 million forint ($36,000) subsidized loan, he explained One third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born, and the entire loan waived after a third child is born Now compare Orban s plan with that of the Hungarian born George Soros, who somehow believes that maintaining strong national borders will fragment the union Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union, he wrote in Foreign Policy [T]hey also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards Building on that crooked foundation, SorosadvisedEuropean lawmakers back in 2016 that the EU should spend 30 billion ($34 billion) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year We already know who will be forced to pick up the tab on that massive expenditure, and it s not George Soros One reason that Soros and his 226 reliable allies support the influx of migrants into Europe is they believe it will somehow offset the continent s demographic and labor shortage The latter part of that plan has already been proven a disaster An OECD reportfoundthat less than 40 percent of immigrants had completed an upper secondary school education or higher, while another studyshowedthat only eight percent of asylum seekers were hired by companies as skilled workers Despite clear signs that George Soros grand plans for the europeanunion are an utter failure, Brussels continues to heed his every word, while at the same time taking steps topunishOrban Just this week, Soroswarned, with no loss of irony, that if Europe doesn t wake up it will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991 The financier fretted over the rise of far right parties in Europe, which he believes will enjoy a competitive advantage in parliamentary elections in May Yes, that is a very big possibility Not once did he suggest, however, that just maybe his grand idea of open borders, made all the more tempting with cash enticements, might just have contributed to that radical disequilibrium of which he spoke If Europe is one day visited by the ghost of its fascist past, George Soros will only have himself to blame Influential people like Soros would have made a far greater impact had they advocated on behalf of peace in the Middle East and North Africa, speaking out on US led interventionist wars that have prompted millions of innocent people to flee their homes Innocent people from war torn countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria deserve the same rights to peace and happiness without having to travel thousands of miles away from home to find it which ironically leads them directly into the homelands of the people who invaded them in the first place! In conclusion, it is highly disturbing that Brussels is willing to give so much credence to a billionaire financier with questionable motives for opening Europe s floodgates to illegal immigration, while vilifying a democratically elected European head of state for attempting to exert some kind of order on a situation that is clearly way out of control @Robert_Bridge Think your friends would be interested?

"29 Dec, 2018",Soros 'person of the year' indeed: In 2018 globalists pushed peoples‚Äô patience to the edge,"Since 2015, the proponents of neoliberalism have been pushing ahead with their plans for open borders and globalist agenda without the consent of the people The last 365 days saw that destructive agenda greatly challenged Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In light of the epic events that shaped our world in 2018, it seems the Yellow Vests the thousands of French citizens who took to the streets of Paris toprotestausterity and the rise of inequality would have been a nice choice for the Financial Times person of the year award Instead, that title wasbestowedupon the billionaire globalist, George Soros, who has arguably done moremeddlingin the affairs of modern democratic states than any other person on the planet Perhaps FT s controversial nomination was an attempt to rally the forces of neoliberalism at a time when populism and nascent nationalism is sweeping the planet Indeed, the shocking images coming out of France provide a grim wake up call as to where we may be heading if the globalists continue to undermine the power of the nation state It is no secret that neoliberalism relentlessly pursues a globalized, borderless world where labor, products, and services obey the hidden hand of the free market What is less often mentioned, however, is that this system is far more concerned with promoting the well being of corporations and cowboy capitalists than assisting the average person on the street Indeed, many of the world s most powerful companies today havemutatedinto stateless superpowers, ù while consumers are forced to endure crippling austerity measures amidplummetingstandards of living The year 2018 could be seen as the tipping point when the grass roots movement against these dire conditions took off Since 2015, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants into Germany and the EU, a groundswell of animosity has been steadily building against the europeanunion , perhaps best exemplified by the Brexit movement Quite simply, many people are growing weary of the globalistargumentthat Europe needs migrants and austerity measures to keep the wheels of the economy spinning At the very least, luring migrants withcash incentivesto move to Germany andelsewherein the EU appears incredibly shortsighted Indeed, if the globalist George Soros wants to lend hisMidas touchto ameliorating the migrant s plight, why does he think that relocating them to European countries is the solution? As is becoming increasingly apparent in places likeSwedenand France, efforts to assimilate people from vastly different cultures, religions and backgrounds is an extremely tricky venture, the success of which is far from guaranteed One worrying consequence of Europe s season of open borders has been the rise of far right political movements In fact, some of the harshest criticism of the Merkel plan originated inHungary, where its gutsy president, Viktor Orban, hopes to build an old school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ù Orban is simply responding to the democratic will of his people, who are fiercely conservative, yet the EU parliament voted topunishhim regardless The move shows that Brussels, aside from being adverse to democratic principles, has very few tools for addressing the rise of far right sentiment that its own misguided policies created Here it is necessary to mention once again that bugbear of the political right, Mr Soros, who has received no political mandate from European voters, yet who campaigns relentlessly on behalf of globalist initiatives through his opensociety Foundations (OSF) (That campaign just got some serious clout after Sorosinjected$18bn dollars of his own money into OSF, making it one of the most influential NGOs in the world) With no small amount of impudence, Soros has condemned EU countries namely his native Hungary for attempting to protect their territories by constructing border barriers and fences, which he believes violate the human rights of migrants (rarely if ever does the philanthropist speak about the human rights ù of the native population) In thewordsof the maestro of mayhem himself: Beggar thy neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards ù Through a leakednetworkof compromised EU parliamentarians who do his bidding, Soros says the EU should spend $30 billion euros ($33bln) to accommodate at least 300,000 refugees each year ù How will the EU pay for the resettling of migrants from the Middle East? Soros has an answer for that as well He calls it surge funding, ù which entails raising a substantial amount of debt backed by the EU s relatively small budget ù George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state This is where the real international political collusion is pic twitter com/ANXOII7SFY Any guesses who will be forced to pay down the debt on this high risk venture? If you guessed George Soros, guess again The already heavily taxed people of Europe will be forced to shoulder that heavy burden To finance it, new European taxes will have to be levied sooner or later, ù Soros admits That comment is very interesting in light of the recent French protests, which weretriggeredby Emmanuel Macron s plan to impose a new fuel tax Was the French leader, a former investment banker, attempting to get back some of the funds being used to support the influx of new arrivals into his country? The question seems like a valid one, and goes far at explaining the ongoing unrest At this point, it is worth remembering what triggered the exodus of migrants into Europe in the first place A large part of the answer comes down to unlawful NATO operations on the ground of sovereign states Since 2003, the 29 member military bloc, under the direct command of Washington, hasconductedillicit military operations in various places around the globe, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria These actions, which could be best described as globalism on steroids, have opened a Pandora s Box of global scourges, including famine, terrorism and grinding poverty Is this what the Western states mean by humanitarian activism ? If the major EU countries really want to flout their humanitarian credentials, they could have started by demanding the cessation of regime change operations throughout the Middle East and North Africa, which created such inhumane conditions for millions of innocent people This failure on the part of Western capitals to speak out against belligerent US foreign policy helps to explain why a number of other European governments are experiencing major shakeups Sebastian Kurz, 32,wonover the hearts of Austrian voters by promising to tackle unchecked immigration In super tolerant Sweden, which hasacceptedmore migrants per capita than any other EU state, the anti immigrant Sweden Democrats partygarnered17 6 percent of the vote in September elections up from 12 9 percent in the previous election And even Angela Merkel, who is seen by many people as the de facto leader of the europeanunion , is watching her political star crash and burn mostly due to her bungling of the migrant crisis In October, after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a stinging setback in Bavaria elections, which saw CDU voters abandon ship for the anti immigrant AfD and the Greens, Merkelannouncedshe would resign in 2021 after her current term expires Meanwhile, back in the US, the government of President Donald Trump has been shut down as the Democrats refuse to grant the American leader the funds to build a wall on the Mexican border despite the fact that he essentially made it to the White House on precisely that promise Personally, I find it very hard to believe that any political party that does not support a strong and viable border can continue to be taken seriously at the polls for very long Yet that is the very strategy that the Democrats have chosen But I digress I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about Crazy! The lesson that Western governments should have learned over the last year from these developments is that there exists a definite red line that the globalists cross at risk not only to the social order, but to their own political fortunes Eventually the people will demand solutions to their problems many of which were caused by reckless neoliberal programs and austerity measures This collective sense of desperation may open the door to any number of right wing politicians only too happy to meet the demand Better to provide fair working conditions for the people while maintaining strong borders than have to face the wrath of the street or some political charlatan later Whether or not Western leaders will change their neoliberal ways as a populist storm front approaches remains to be seen, but I for one am not betting on it @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others is an award winning journalist For over 25 years, he worked as a sub editor and writer for The Mirror, Irish Times, Irish Independent and Britain s Independent, among others But the debate requires much more than moral appeals ù A recentstudyentitled Building Walls puts the growth of EU internal and external border barriers into stark perspective In the 1990s, there were two border walls Now the number has grown to a total of 17, with most of the structures built over the past three years Ten countries out of 28 EU member states have built physical barriers to control migrants entering from outside the bloc They include Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Latvia The authors of the above report call the structures edifices of fear ù and make the startling comparison to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany until its dismantlement in 1989 EU states have built border barriers equivalent to the length of six Berlin Walls The report also reproaches the proliferation of mental walls ù across EU member states with the rise of what it calls far right ù and racist ù political parties There are now, it is claimed, 10 EU states in which xenophobic ù parties have significant government or parliamentary representation However, the problem with a report like this is that it provides no practical solutions to the immense political and social challenges stemming from phenomenal migration The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that a record number of 68 5 million people worldwide are forcibly on the move from their origins, many of them trying to reach Europe We can perhaps agree that in recent years that the EU has faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers and would be refugees That, in turn, has engendered political and social tensions, as well as anti immigrant parties and anti EU popular sentiments The authors of Building Walls, however, largely base their appeal on moral arguments in favor of accepting migrants in the context of human rights They call on EU governments to reject racist discourse of the extreme right ùand to reverse the policies that lead us to walling ourselves in and defending a fortress in which the privileged and secure live ù That recommendation reveals an abject naivety Millions of EU citizens would not consider themselves privileged and secure, ù as the authors claim In the 58 page report, there is this tiny mention of the real issues at stake civilsociety and political parties should rigorously study the structural causes of 68 5 million people having to flee their homes by force, in order to implement prevention policies based on global economic justice and to prevent war and armed conflict ù Indeed, structural causes ù need scrutinizing These issues should be comprehensively explored if a proper understanding and solution to the problem are to be achieved Such an approach would also go some way to addressing the concomitant issue of anti immigrant politics and resentment towards the EU status quo Here is where disclosure by the Building Walls study is pertinent The publisher, the Transnational Institute, based in Amsterdam, isfundedin part by liberal financier George Soros The billionaire hasdeclaredhimself an advocate for open borders and promoting the rights of refugees Some critics see Soros agenda as something more sinister than mere philanthropy He isaccusedof trying to undermine national sovereign controls over migration In Hungary, from where Soros migrated years ago to the US, the government of Viktor Orban has even gone as far as banning organizations funded by the billionaire READ MORE:Soros funded uni campus for US programs forced out of Hungary, opening in Vienna It seems significant that the Building Walls report deals with the whole matter of refugees and migration from the premise of acceptance It avoids tackling the phenomenon with an analysis of structural causes, even though the authors briefly mention the key issues of poverty and war The expansion of walls across the EU and the increase in refugees are correlated with the spate of illegal wars the United States and its NATO allies have fomented in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia over the past three decades The wars are the cause, the refugees are the effect The main migration routes to Europe via the Mediterranean and Balkans follow the pattern of wars that the US and its NATO allies have waged, overtly and covertly, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, among other countries The opening of these routes then draws in migrants from many other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa Indisputably, the US and EU are both complicit in perpetrating criminal wars which have unleashed the unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in Europe Added to that are international neoliberal economic policies pushed by Washington and the EU, which have impoverished African nations, leading to environmental crises and communities being displaced The same structural causes apply to the migrant caravan heading towards the US from Central America For decades, Washington has ransacked its backyard ù with counterinsurgency warfare and sponsoring repressive regimes, which have in turn led to the spawning of criminal gangs and mass poverty Any wonder then that droves of desperate people decide to flee to somewhere they perceive as relatively safe The other side of the coin is poverty and bankrupt economics in the EU, as well as the US For decades, governments have been crushing their own people with brutal austerity and grinding poverty The gulf between a tiny wealthy elite and the mass of impoverished society has exploded The hardship and misery under Western corporate capitalism has understandably engendered huge insecurity and anxiety within populations Such sentiments feed into reactionary politics and are susceptible to perceiving foreigners as threats Having said that, it should be recognized that resident communities in Europe or the US have a valid grievance about abrupt cultural changes It seems inappropriate to dismiss objections as merely racist ù or xenophobic ù Why should settled populations have to deal with a sudden influx of foreigners?

Independent journalist Luc Rivet told RT that the vote accomplished little aside from victimizing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose popularity with Hungarians is only likely to increase While the vote s outcome was expected, what was truly shocking was the language used by MEPs and even senior EU officials while denouncing Orban during a debate in parliament on Tuesday European Commission vice president Frans Timmermanssaidthat Orban had chosen a coward s way out by claiming that the EU was targeting the whole of Hungary, rather than just its government MEPs also hurled insults at Orban, with Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, describing the Hungarian leader as a neo fascist Rivet said that these comments revealed an astonishing rift in the bloc s sense of unity The worst that Europe can produce we heard yesterday and today This bullying will go nowhere because Article 7 will never be applied Italy, Austria and Poland will refuse of course that this be applied, at council level, if not at parliament level Laughland also took aim at the report authored by Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini, which was used to determine that there is a clear risk that Hungary could be undermining the values of the europeanunion He called the report a grotesque exercise in disinformation, which is full of half truths and untruths, which really does great to discredit to the woman who drew it up Rivet echoed a similar sentiment, describing the report authored by Sargentini as a piece of work It s really incredibly aggressive in its content, and she didn t even go to Hungary to make this report She only relied upon sources like Mr George Soros and his friends So really it s incredible For Laughland, Sargentini s report illustrates two very distinct European worldviews When you compare it to the Hungarian government s response, you can see that you are dealing on the one hand with intelligence, with people who are intelligent and civilized, and on the other hand with someone who is stupid and malicious And in a way I think that s the most frightening aspect of it this conflict between intelligence and stupidity, or between civilized behavior and nastiness ",https://www.rt.com/news/438316-eu-hungary-article-seven-crazy/

proceedings have never got as far as the MEP vote before Hungary, it is the next step that looks impassible The European Council, which represents the heads of all the 28 states, would have to agree with the MEPs, and do so unanimously Several countries are almost guaranteed to veto this step Poland, undergoing a near identical EU investigation, which Hungary has said it will veto, is certain to disagree, as are Hungary s other Visegrad Four allies Czechia and Slovakia and more EU states opposed to multiculturalism, migration and potential Brussels meddling in internal affairs In fact, in view of today s proceedings, even the Conservative controlled UK will likely vote against the Article 7 invocation So, what we are actually seeing is not the show trial ùspoken of by Farage, but more

"19 Aug, 2018",Attack on academic freedom or stand against pseudoscience: Is Hungary right to ban gender studies?,"Viktor Orban s Hungary risks becoming a European pariah after declaring it will no longer certify gender studies courses Even if they re right about their academic worthlessness, should officials tell universities what to teach? Astonishment was the word Budapest s Central European University (CEU) used inresponseto the government s measures without any justification or antecedent first proposed last year and outlined in detail earlier this month The 44 students enrolled in the master s program at the George Soros backed university would be allowed to complete their courses, alongside the 10 person intake at the state funded ELTE, the only other Hungarian university to teach the discipline But from next year onwards, the ministry of education will not spend public funds on gender studies, nor award diplomas for completing a degree (though CEU students can continue to study for the English language US certified degree) READ MORE: Christian democracy to crush multiculturalism in EU vote next year Hungary s Orban The decision places Hungary radically at odds with the rest of the Western world From Croatia to Ireland, every other EU state has at least one functioning gender studies program, and in the US, the number has risen threefold in the last three decades, with courses offered at over 350 higher learning institutions But perhaps more astonishing than the closure itself is the honesty with which the government is justifying its decision Although officials statements mention low enrollment, financial expediency, and real world applicability of gender studies diplomas, they have made it explicit that this is an ideological decision first and foremost For the first time in decades, a democratic country has made an explicit pushback against the left wing drift of academia The subject of the discipline goes against everything the government thinks about human beings, Bence Retvari, the minister of human resources and one of the ideologues of the proposal,toldparliament last year Gender studies îsimilarly to Marxism Leninism îcan be called an ideology rather than a science, and therefore it is doubtful that it attains the scientific level expected for a university degree course It can be argued that rather than being like Marxism Leninism, gender studies are in fact Marxism Leninism, founded on feminist theory and intersected with the latest left wing sociology and political science Here is asampleof the areas of specialization from the CEU course website: Gender Dimensions of Post State Socialism; Feminist Knowledge Production; Activism, Social Movements and Policy; Gendering Theory It is, frankly, doubtful that it is possible to meaningfully engage with (or even critique) most of these topics without contentious pre existing ideological suppositions And having emerged from their own traumatic history of totalitarian socialism, Viktor Orban s nationalists do not want to see their homeland re infected with a new strain they see as wreaking havoc in Sweden or Germany This study does not help in raising our nation; moreover it destroys value oriented thinking that is still present in the Central European countries Our burning problem is the demographic issue, which will not be solved by studying sexual minorities and deepening feminist philosophy, Lorinc Nacsa of the ruling coalition Christian Democratswroteto ELTE after it unveiled its gender studies course last year Stripped of the initial shock value, this perspective is at least understandable For the current government, the growth of a self perpetuating cottage industry of gender studies faculties around the world is no more a justification of their legitimacy than the popularity of alchemy at medieval universities is proof that base metals can be turned into gold And this fits in perfectly with Orban s vision of his provocatively named illiberal democracy, for which he has been given mandate by an overwhelming victory in April s election But the line between a robust democracy that refuses to shepherd its electorate into a narrow corridor of acceptable social views, and outright authoritarianism is not an impermeable one, particularly in a new, and still relatively fragile, social order such as post Communist Hungary ELTE issued an extendedstatementin which it accused the government of violating the constitution, and pointed out that its studies have specific societal uses, such as understanding the impacts of an economic crisis on women, or the social effect that many Hungarian women going abroad for childcare jobs has had on the men left behind at home ELTE also said the government did not directly inform them of the proposed changes, and demanded a consultation that would hopefully result in a compromise Gabor Bencsik, the pro government editor in chief of the Hungarian Chronicle, alsocalledon the ruling coalition to re evaluate its arrogant decision, saying that gender studies courses are not in themselves against traditional values, and could be used to ask questions such as Is it possible to boost the birthrate? or How can men and women in families better relate to their children? Despite these dissenting voices, the decision doesn t appear to have provoked concerted outrage, particularly as it has been dragging on for 18 months, and is sandwiched between dozens of other stories pointing to the ascendancy of the government, such as the campaign against Lajos Simicska, a former pro Orban media magnate turned nemesis, and the decision by Soros opensociety Foundation to close its Budapest offices If Orban s opponents want to reverse his policies, they will not do it with editorials about the Magyar dictatorship ,but will likely have to wait their turn at the ballot box ",https://www.rt.com/news/436329-hungary-gender-studies-ban-orban/

The fact is that, if Putin or anyone else was really interested in weakening the EU or the US (if such a thing were even possible), they would not trouble themselves by putting populist politicians in power, who would work to reverse the rot of unregulated immigration, and other such irritants In fact, they would just let Soros and his merry band of mischief makers continue doing exactly what they have been doing all along: destroy the EU from within with a disastrous agenda In closing, it bears mentioning that President Putin justsigned a lawmandating the implementation of counter sanctions against any state or person involved in hostile actions ùagainst Russia Whether that legislation works to tame the anti Russia hysteria now inflaming the planet with fake news remains to be seen @Robert_Bridge Like this story?

PS:Well, you know, Hungary was maybe the loudest supporter within the europeanunion to help the Ukrainians to get the visa free regime and to make the EU Ukraine Association agreement to come into force And, unfortunately, a couple of days after that there was a regulation passing in the Ukrainian parliament which violates the rights of the Hungarians when it comes to education on mother tongue So we made it very clear that we have to use all kinds of instruments in the toolbox of international politics in order to make sure that the rights of the Hungarians will be restored in Ukraine SS:So you have sent a memorandum to NATO suggesting that Hungarians shouldn t abide by Ukrainian laws Why do you think NATO is going to back up your memorandum? PS:Well, you know, we are part of the alliance So it s obvious that we inform our allies about our policy towards the country which has the inspiration to go forward when it comes to the Euro Atlantic integration path And we would be very happy to come back to our position to support Ukrainians on this path, but definitely the Ukrainians have to comply with international regulations when it comes to minorities The Venice Commission made a very clear proposal to the Ukrainians to consult with the national minorities and do not implement any kind of regulations that violate already existing rights of the minorities So all we want is nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just Ukraine to comply with the EU regulations and with the proposals of the Venice Commission SS:So your memorandum to NATO was just to inform the allies rather than to expect a reaction from them? PS:There s a continuous negotiation, of course, going on with the NATO member states, with allies, with the europeanunion about how we see this situation We made a proposal there that those minorities belonging to NATO member states should be exempt from such kind of regulations We will see whether there s any reaction from our allies and then we will continue the dialogue and discussion about that SS:Members of the European Parliament are accusing Hungary of human rights violations, saying that your Prime Minister is smearing critics, journalists and NGOs You ve said those are lies Why do they have such a harsh stance on your Prime Minister? PS:We had and we re still having a very serious debate with the international network which is led and financed by George Soros whose name you and your viewers might know We have a very open and a very serious debate with him as the Hungarian government has a very strong anti migration policy We made it very clear that it s only us, Hungarians, who can make a decision whom we allow to come to Hungary It s only us, Hungarians, to make a decision with whom we want to live together We don t want to let neither the europeanunion nor the United Nations to force us to invite people in our country whom we don t want to invite We made it very clear that protection of our border and guaranteeing the security of our citizens is the number one priority for us And George Soros and his network is totally against this concept He would like to invite millions of migrants to Europe on an annual basis He basically wants to get rid of the phenomenon of nation states So this is a very open confrontation between us, and we have to see that the Soros network definitely has people who are members of the European Parliament And these kind of attacks against my country, our government and our Prime Minister are based on this political approach You know, these kinds of reports which are being written about my country absolutely take facts out of context SS:Are they groundless? PS:Yeah, absolutely I mean, just let me give you two examples All these accusations say that there s no media freedom in Hungary But if you look in the Internet, for example, if you look at the web pages you will see that anti government rhetoric and government critics are in majority compared to those news which are favoring the government or considering the government decisions as positive In Hungary it would be totally impossible to hide facts like migrant attacks on citizens of our country In some Western European countries it did happen Or when it comes to anti Semitism it s a constant accusation against us Although we re proud that we have absolutely implemented zero tolerance against anti Semitism There s the biggest Jewish community of Central Europe living in Budapest We do not only renovate the synagogues in Hungary but outside Hungary as well It s not Budapest where Jewish youngsters wearing kippah are attacked openly in the streets SS: in Paris, everywhere, yes, absolutely PS: and compared to that we re always under accusations SS:Brussels is also accusing your government of stepping on the independence of the judiciary and they are actually threatening to invoke an EU law, Article 7, that would strip Hungary of the EU voting rights Could it come to that? PS:There are definitely some endeavors to put very heavy attacks on Hungary and on Poland as well So, the procedure based on Article 7 you refer to was launched in relation to Poland We opposed that because we absolutely think it s based on double standards When you take facts into consideration there s no factual ground, no factual basis to launch this kind of procedure against Hungary For example, when it comes to judiciary you were kind enough to refer to, yes, we did have debates with the European Commission about legislation in Hungary regarding the judiciary system But the fact is that we already closed all those issues in three different ways: we either understood that the Commission was right and changed the regulation, either the Commission admitted that we were right and then we left it as it was, or we couldn t agree and then we went to the European Court and had to respect the decisions of the European Court So these are all closed issues So all these issues that are being put in the report about Hungary very recently in the Committee of Liberties and Justice of the European Parliament these are mostly already closed issues between the European Commission and Hungary SS:So, in general Brussels has lots of demands when it comes to Hungary And they are actually saying that if Hungary doesn t meet those demands whether it s the judiciary or the freedom of press or immigration, they are saying: We may not fund you in the next EU budget ù Here s the thing: whatever EU gives you it only makes up to † 6 percent of your budget First of all, is it worth it? Is this money worth doing everything they want you to do? Because I know that Mr Orban said: We don t need German money anyways ù PS:Well, you know, Hungary s interest is the europeanunion to be strong because a strong Hungary needs a strong europeanunion We have a very open economy and 79% of our export goes to the europeanunion We have an export to GDP ratio around 90%, so you can imagine how significant for us it is the europeanunion to be strong and to have a competitive economy On the other hand, when it comes to European funds, yes, European funds play an important role in our economy But this is not a one way road We don t get these funds as a gift, as a humanitarian aid or as a donation from our Western European friends These funds are to be given to us based on contracts Why? Because the Hungarian economy has been opened, the Hungarian market has been opened for Western European companies making a lot of profit This is one lane of the road And the other lane of the road is the European funding So, this is not a one way road, you understand? This is a vice versa situation We totally reject that false context, we re painted up on the wall as if we would only enjoy the European funds for free This is not true We have complied with our obligations based on contracts as well And according to the statistics of the European institutions 70 cents of every 1 euro which is paid to the Central European countries go back to Western European companies SS:There s also the opposition of Hungary and Poland the East vs West because Hungary and Poland are making sure whatever they have to say is heard at this point I don t think Brussels likes it † What do you think this East vs West confrontation would mean for the union? PS:We re absolutely interested in the unity of the europeanunion We oppose all kind of comparison like that, like, if there were Eastern and Western members of the europeanunion because the europeanunion must show unity Although, if we put into consideration why Poland and Hungary are under this constant torture, let s put it this way, well, it s obvious we have the two strongest governments in the europeanunion We are the two countries where a one party government has received the authorization from the people to govern the country We have absolutely stable political systems Many times it s definitely not liked by the institutes in Brussels There s a big debate in the europeanunion whether to go sovereignist or federalistic way The federalistic way would end up in the United States of Europe, which we oppose because SS: yeah, tighter control, unified budget, more integration That s what France and Germany want Do you think it s a viable thing? PS:Our position is that europeanunion can only be strong if there are strong member states So we don t think that the concept of weak member states creating a strong europeanunion would be realistic We think that only strong member states can form a strong europeanunion That s why, for example, we are absolutely in favor of the competition within the europeanunion , meaning that we don t like the tax harmonization, for example, and we don t want irresponsible economic policies to be communized What I mean is that those countries can reduce taxes that are disciplined fiscally speaking Those countries that are not disciplined fiscally, that let debt increase, they definitely cannot afford cutting taxes But the answer shouldn t be to bash those who are able to cut the taxes SS:Your Prime Minister sees the Orban the europeanunion as an alliance of sovereign states europeanunion is the union that crosses state boundaries It s, like, the core principle of the europeanunion  europeanunion is based on the principles of liberalism Your country is a nation based, conservative country, which is not a good thing or a bad thing Russia s same way On ideological level there are so many differences In a basis it s not even economics Why do you want to be part of the union so much that opposes everything that you, guys, stand for? PS:Well, actually, it s not everything SS:But core things PS:Yeah, but if you look at the statistics, for example, how many infringement procedures are going on against us and others, you will see that we re somewhere in the middle, so, there s nothing extraordinary in this regard We definitely have the debates based on ideology as well For example, when it comes to the fact that when the election is not won by the liberals then the system is immediately considered not a democracy, which is totally unacceptable If the liberals do not win it can be democracy, of course That s why what we re intending to build in Hungary is a Christian democracy, based on Christian values, work, achievement, merit based society There are debates about that as well But all in all our interest is the strong europeanunion because within the strong europeanunion Hungary can be strong SS:There s this EU Commissioner who actually voiced her opinion about Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland voicing their concerns and views, she said those are sandbags ù that can be thrown away Could it come to that? PS:Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the Visegrad countries are members of the europeanunion and will be members of the europeanunion Even more than that This Central European region is currently the growth engine of the europeanunion Our growth rate is much higher than the European average Everybody speaks about the German French cooperation when it comes to the issue of European competitiveness But if you look at the figures you will see that the trade between Germany and the Visegrad countries is 55% higher than the annual trade between Germany and France That shows that the economic cooperation between Germany and Central Europe is extremely strong Central Europe became kind of a backyard for the German industry which has always been and which will always be the backbone of the European economy So a strong Central Europe is in the interest of the europeanunion because a strong Central Europe can contribute to the europeanunion being strong as well That s why we reject these kinds of accusations and politically based attacks against us SS:The bottom line is the EU is in crisis right now There are Eastern countries that want more independence in terms of making decisions There s the center Brussels, France and Germany who want more integration and maybe a two speed Europe It s absolutely clear that the EU cannot go on living in a shape that it is in right now Something needs to change We don t really know what Where do you see Hungary in this Union? Do you feel, like, you ll be one of those faster integrating countries? Or do you feel, like, you would want to be in the second part where the countries would have more decisions to themselves, but they won t be as integrated as France and Germany? PS:If you mean that the europeanunion is faced with historic challenges, you re right Not only one We have the migration crisis, we have the threat of terror, we have the Brexit, we have the energy security issues and many others which we have to deal with So that s why I think it s obvious that there are debates going on about the future of the europeanunion because when should debates go on if not now when we have to find answers to the historic type of challenges? Our approach is definitely a sovereignist approach meaning that those answers that have already been given successfully to these kind of questions have been made on the level of member states For instance, take the migration issue Hungary s answer was the only successful answer by regaining the control of our own border with the assistance of the Visegrad countries, and making it obvious that it s absolutely possible to protect your border and do not let any illegal migrants enter the territory of your country SS:I have to ask you about this, Minister, because you were so adamant about migration, building walls, cracking down on NGOs and then secretly you accepted 1300 refugees and it s like the quota that the EU asks you to accept anyway What s the point of being so tough on it if you were going to secretly accept those people anyway? PS:These are two totally different things Asylum seekers based on the Geneva Convention shouldn t be confused with illegal migrants entering the territory of ours in a violent way, attacking our police, tearing down the fence, not respecting our rules and regulations, blocking our highways, occupying our public areas, not wanting to go to the refugee stations and so on and so forth These two things shouldn t be confused because these are two different issues SS:The mood in the europeanunion in general is changing Austria has the first anti immigration Chancellor, Germany has the far right Alternative for Germany Party is the third biggest party in the Bundestag, Emmanuel Macron is very liberal on words and when it comes to implementing policies, it s pretty much center right as well Do you feel like saying we ve told you so, we ve been reprimanded so much for this and then all of you, guys, are coming to what we were saying ù? PS:You know, politics is not a profession where you get credit if it turns out that you were right But it is obvious that on the last couple of parliamentary elections in the europeanunion the main issue was migration That was the case in Italy, that was the case in Austria, you ve put it forward, that was the case in Hungary And in all free countries those parties receive the most votes that run anti migration policies You ve mentioned the Austrian Chancellor, who s definitely representing an anti migration policy In Italy the parties forming the coalition are anti migration parties In Hungary we ve made it very clear that we will not allow any illegal migrants entering the territory of our country You see the latest statements of the German Minister of Interior And you ve rightly quoted some new measures implemented by France You see the statements of the British about the main motivations of the Brexit vote which is definitely in correlation with sovereign issues of migration and so on and so forth So definitely migration is becoming the hot issue on the current European agenda and we see that more and more people, more and more political leaders understand that letting all those migrants into Europe definitely doesn t serve the target of a better future of the europeanunion SS:So how come so many countries in the EU are anti immigrant, are pushing their ideas and measures about that Just as many countries are against anti Russia sanctions but when it comes to extending † them all of them agree silently to extend them Why can t you be as firm on anti Russia sanctions? PS:Well, if you ask me whether there are double standards I would say yes ù We are a small country And we understand that the big Western European countries make big businesses here If you come to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and you look around, and you look for the companies coming from EU member states you will definitely see much more companies coming from the Western European big member states than from the Central European countries If you see the top event of this forum there will be the panel shared by the Russian and the French presidents If you look at the preparations of Nord Stream 2 you will see the biggest Western European energy companies being involved If you look at how the trade figures are changing between Russia and the Western European countries, one might be surprised If you ask whether there are double standards, yes, they definitely are There s a big debate in the europeanunion whether the sanctions were successful or not But definitely the unity of the europeanunion is very important SS: Even if it is at the expense of the anti Russian sanctions? PS: that s why the prolongation of the sanctions has already been decided upon But it s interesting to come here to see the big Western European companies making business with the Russian counterparts SS:You know, we re open to anyone who wants to come and make business with us Thank you very much for this interview, Foreign Minister Good luck with everything PS:Thank you I really do appreciate it RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/428412-hungary-eu-pressure-deal/

Why does it not say that we must recognise those counter cyclical problems, and will certainly do so if unemployment grows by X per cent?

"10 May, 2018",How the US stifles free speech: Reviving McCarthyism & nurturing Orwellian society,"The new or expanded Global Engagement Center under the State Department seems to be morphing into what one might someday recognize as Orwell s Ministry of Truth Recent events over past months have caused many to suspect the reliability of news and information provided to us, often by our own governments Alternative news sources threaten to disrupt the message or narrative crafted by governments and large organizations The US Global Engagement Center is mobilizing in response to counter alternative media, conflicting perspectives and foreign influence such as Russian Propaganda The rush to judgement, complete failure to follow international norms, and subsequent actions in response to both the alleged poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in the UK and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria leaves many questions unanswered That narratives of government officials and mainstream media (MSM) are in lockstep despite the lack of any real evidence makes one suspicious of the ultimate objectives Whatever these objectives may be, they certainly appear misplaced and bring increased international tension Both these instances have the appearance of false flag operations However, despite the lack of a thorough investigation, British Prime Minister May was quick to state the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent, Novichok, and claimed it was highly likely ù that it was the Russian government behind the attack †Both the UK and Russia are signatories of the internationalChemical Weapons Convention There are setproceduresto be followed in the event of the suspected use of chemical weapons, such as Novichok, which include notification of the OPCW, cooperation of state parties and the instigation of a fact finding investigation These procedures were not followed and, in fact, Russia has yet to be included in the investigation or even provided samples There seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding so many aspects of the entire incident Despite the lack of evidence and the fragmentation of the initial storyline, the Skripal poisoning served certain interests by diverting attention away from the UK government and toward Russia The subsequent mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK, US and EU countries caused the further deterioration of international relations Throughout this period, MSM toed the party line and lately it appears to have gone silent Closely following the Skripals poisoning, surprise surprise, the famed White Helmets released a video of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria †Once again, despite no evidence and prior to the arrival of OPCW inspectors, the US, UK, and France launched airstrikes against Syria, targeting supposed chemical weapons facilities There has yet to be any indication that a chemical weapons attack actually took place †Local citizens and doctors have testified recently that there was no chemical attack and that the incident was staged Once again, MSM fails to cover the inconsistencies of the story which call in to serious question the actual occurrence of the attack Information from MSM sources, for the most part, is completely in compliance with information either being filtered or suppressed to support the desired narrative The storylines, absent of credible facts or evidence, is reminiscent of the Trust Me! approach regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction that led to Operation Iraqi Liberation (renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom) †The most recent instances add to the ongoing Russophobic hysteria engulfing the West under a very questionable pretext Those that are skeptical of the official narrative or act to provide a differing perspective are frequently ridiculed and demonized, often accused of being one of Putin s useful idiots The list seems to be endless and spans from Russian scholarProfessor Stephen Cohenand Australian journalistJohn Pilgerto UK Labour leaderJeremy Corbynor, at times, even the republicanparty This past year we have seen many alternative media sources essentially blacklisted ù by the secretive organizationPropOrNotwhichpublishedthe names of more than 250 alternative news sources, accusing them of being Russian agents The Washington Post promoted thestoryand, originally, ProporNot

another blacklist ùsurfaced, identifying more than 2,300 guests of the Russian news station, RT The list was published by a Czech Non Governmental Organization (NGO), European Values, whose largest donor just happens to be George Soros opensociety Foundation in addition to US, UK, and EU government contributions We often view that the foundation of democracy lies in the freedom of one s beliefs, in one s right to express ourselves whether that is through print, speech, or the sharing of ideas The First Amendment enshrines these concepts with the Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom to Assemble Yet the ability to shape those ideas and thoughts relies on the ability to have open access to information and to participate in a dialogue of our beliefs and ideas With the advent of media, and more recently with the internet and social media, access to and sharing of information with differing views has expanded immensely However, recent initiatives have acted to stifle this open and free communication †The passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (P L 114 328, FY 2017 NDAA, section 1287) codified the Global Engagement Center and significantly expanded its role The Global Engagement Center (GEC) evolved from the original Counterterrorism Communications Center (CTCC) The CTCC was established in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 †Its objective was the coordination inter agency messaging and to coordinate specific messaging for the Department of State and Department of Defense †The CTCC went through several restructurings through the years until it was the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communication (CSCC) with essentially the same mission The organization had minimum funding and no direct line item from Congress President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13721 in March 2016, which officially established the GEC in lieu of the CSCC The GEC purpose and structure were similar to the CSCC It was tasked with leading inter agency efforts in support of US government sponsored counterterrorism communications Section 1287 states that the GEC s purpose is to counter foreign state and non state propaganda and disinformation efforts ùthat threaten US national security interests as well as security interests of US allies and partner countries This significantly changes the GEC s role from one of counterterrorism to one of countering foreign communications per se Moreover, it provides the new GEC with significant resource authorizations well beyond those previously provided Along with the significant expanded mission area and increased authority, the GEC will receive substantially greater funding and will include direct funding from Congress as well as authority for an additional $60 million to be transferred from the Department of Defense The GEC expansion of responsibilities is a result of the challenges of articulating a consistent message and to counter alternative information and perspectives Legislation seeks to strengthen the GEC in order to counter foreign influence, primarily Russian and Chinese disinformation efforts This evolution of the GEC is not without challenges Earlier versions of the GEC were underfunded and undermanned †The legislation and subsequent mission shift has been given to an organization operating with a focused mission to counter primarily extremist terrorism and ill prepared to counter global information flows with varying perspectives For instance, based on theNew York Times, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department s Global Engagement Center which has been tasked with countering Moscow s disinformation campaign speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts ùAs implied byVanity Fair, resource challenges, a changing mission, new technology, organizational confusion, and leadership uncertainty have contributed to the questionable performance and future of the GEC †Yet, the NDAA 2017, as well as more recent emphasis fromCongress, provide the clear intent from Congress for the increased global role of the GEC, along with the authority and resources to support it This, along with the recent confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new GEC leadership, may see the GEC rapidly evolve to complete its transformation and become the master of information Congressional pressure on technology companies, specifically social media organizations, throughout the evidence free Russiagate hearings has contributed to filtering what and how we access information †Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been grilled in hearings and are taking steps to control the flow of information Facebook has engaged fact checkers to verify information One wonders who checks the fact checkers? †Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google have also developed filters and Trust Indicators to prioritize what is seen, or not seen, and how, byusers This is done in the name of combating fake news or countering alleged Russian propaganda These actions, as well asdemonetizingsites, controlling advertising (RT and Sputnik advertising banned on Twitter), censoring information (SouthfrontandVeterans Today),de ranking as with RT, or cancelling and suspending accounts (SyrianGirl banned on Facebook and YouTube) directly influence one s access to information, essentially censoring for the good of the public Censorship and disinformation infringes on our ability to access factual information, to form our own judgements, to enlighten ourselves to differing perspectives †It essentially acts to shape our perspectives to preconceived narratives that may be counter to our own underlying values It is a realization of George Orwell s Newspeak †It is a direct attack on the most fundamental right of a free and opensociety the right of free speech †We have been gradually witnessing the erosion of the underlying principles of democracy The threat is not from any foreign power, it s from within Where are we going as a country? †Are we reincarnating McCarthyism? †Are we nurturing an Orwellian

Are election results in the EU only legitimate when the outcome suits Brussels? Hungary deals another blow to liberalism, with Fidesz and Jobbik winning 70% of vote Long past time that leaders who still care about liberalism (Merkel, Macron, Tusk) let their voices be heard, take action and impose real costs Despite what Western media †might have us believe, Orban is far from on his own in Europe His victory speaks to a growing tide of anti EU feeling across the 28 member bloc Horst Seehofer, Germany s federal interior minister whose Bavarian CSU party is an important ally to Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats said he was pleased with Orban s clear victory and warned that the arrogance and paternalism with respect to other member states coming from Brussels is wrong Merkel and Seehofer are currently at odds over Germany s immigration policies Italy s Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti migration Northern League, and whose center right alliance is now the biggest political bloc in the country, congratulated Hungarians on defending their own companies, their own workers, their own students, their own future and their own borders France s National Front leader Marine Le Pen said Orban s win reflected the rejection of the mass immigration policies favored by Brussels and tweeted optimism that nationalists could win a majority in the 2019 European Parliament elections Hungary has its fair share of problems and Orban has undoubtedly moved toward a more authoritarian style of leadership Nonetheless, his win is legitimate and will empower him further There is already talk of a crackdown on non governmental organizations as part of Orban s long running feud with liberal Hungarian billionaire George Soros The stopsoros package of laws would target non governmental organizations which support migration Among the proposals is a 25 percent tax on foreign donations received by those NGOs Orban can now go to Brussels with an even clearer mandate than he had before, which will be much to his benefit His victory and unwavering commitment to his party s policies in the face of extreme criticism will also inspire other anti EU, anti immigration parties across the EU to follow in Orban s footsteps where they can ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/423629-hungary-orban-election-anti-eu/

The report shows the social reach of these anti EU articles published by the Kremlin owned channels was 134 million potential impressions Where were those impressions? If they were in America, for example, they re going to struggle to influence Brexit No other state controlled media outlet came close to social exposure of Russian media ù If anything, this is congratulations to RT s social media department, because that is kind of their job, to get stories read It s not more sinister just because it s linked to the word Russia, and perhaps there should be some examination about whether there is a widespread demonization happening here The claims include that RT and Sputnik are different from other media outlets because, among other things, they re state funded ù and appear to be about soft power ù and influence ù Does that remind you of anyone else? (Y know, the BBC, the corporation which faces constant accusations of anti Brexit bias ) Optimistically, 89up says it has handed its report to the British Parliament s Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and called on parliament to investigate role of UK based Russian propaganda outlets ù The group of MPs looking into alleged Brexit meddling has continuously failed to find evidence that it actually happened, so it will probably gratefully accept the report More revelations are promised in the coming days, but based on the opening accusations, no one should expect to see a smoking gun ",https://www.rt.com/uk/418585-89up-brexit-meddling-soros/

"6 Feb, 2018",Your guide to top anti-Russia think tanks in US & who funds them,"Countering Russia has become a lucrative industry in Washington In recent years, the think tank business has exploded But who funds these organizations, who works for them and what are the real agendas at play? From the start, let s be clear, the term think tank essentially amounts to a more polite way of saying lobby group Bar a few exceptions, they exist to serve and promote the agendas of their funders However, particularly in the United States, the field has become increasingly shady and disingenuous, with lobbyists being given faux academic titles like Senior Non Resident Fellow and Junior Adjunct Fellow and the like And this smokescreen usually serves to cloud the real goals of these operations Think tanksactually originate from the Europe of the Dark Ages That s 9th century France, to be precise But the modern American movement is modeled on British organizations from around a millennium later, many of which, such as RUSI (1831) , still exist today The concept was possibly brought to America by the Scottish born Andrew Carnegie And his Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (1910) is still going strong Yet, the real boom in the think tank industrycame with the era of globalization With a 200 percent rise in numbers since 1970 And in recent years, they ve become more transnational, with foreign states and individuals sponsoring them in order to gain curry favor in Washington One country that largely hasn t bothered playing this game is Russia Instead, mostly in the foreign policy and defense sectors, Moscow frequently serves as Enemy Number One for many advocacy groups Here are some prominent outfits in the think tank racket, which focus on hyping up threats from Russia Founded:1961 What is it?Essentially the academic wing of NATO The Atlantic Council serves to link people useful to the organization s agenda across Europe and North America However, in recent years, its recruitment has increasingly focused on employees who directly attack Russia, especially on social media Presumably, this is to give them a guaranteed income so they can continue their activities, without needing to worry about paying the bills What does it do?Promotes the idea of Russia being an existential threat to Europe and the US, in order to justify NATO s reason for being Who are its people?The Atlantic Council s list of lobbyists (sorry, Fellows !) reads like a telephone directory of the Russia bashing world For instance,Dmitri Alperovitch(of Crowdstrike, which conveniently alleges how Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee) isjoinedby the perennially wrongAnders Aslund, who has predicted Russia s impending collapse on a number of occasions and has, obviously, been off the mark Then there s Joe Biden s Russia hand, ùMichael Carpenter and their recent co authored Foreign Affairs piecesuggestshe actually knows very little about the country Meanwhile,Evelyn Farkas, a fanatical Russophobe who served in Barack Obama s administration has also found a home here Another interesting Atlantic Council lobbyist is Eliot Higgins, a geolocation expert ùwho has made a career out of spinning tales from the Ukraine and Syrian wars but is, naturally, mostly disinterested in covering Iraq and Yemen, where the US and its allies are involved, but Russia has no particular stake Lastly, we can t forget CNN s Michael Weiss, the self declared Russia analyst ùwho, by all accounts,has never beento Russia and can t speak Russian Who pays for it?The Atlantic Council hasquite an eclectic bunch of patrons to serve NATO itself is a big backer, along with military contractors Saab, Lockheed Martin and the Raytheon Company, all of which naturally benefit from increased tensions with Moscow The UK Foreign Office also splashes the cash and is joined by the Ukrainian World Congress and the US Department of State Other sugar daddies include the US military (via separate contributions from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps), Northrop Grumman and Boeing Founded:2005 What is it?Despite the name, CEPA is based in Washington, not the old continent , but it does have an outpost in Warsaw This club specifically focusses on Central and Eastern Europe and promoting the US Army and foreign policy establishment s agenda there Or, in its own words, creating a Central and Eastern Europe with close and enduring ties to the United States ù What does it do?CEPA amounts to a home for media figures who devote their careers to opposing Russia It whips up tensions, even when they don t really exist, presumably in order to drum up business for its sponsors, who are heavily drawn from the military industry For example, it spent last year hyping up the threat from Russia s and Belarus joint Zapad exercises, even running a sinister looking countdown clock before the long planned training commenced CEPA grosslyoverestimatedthe size of the event, saying it could be the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War ùand dismissing basically all Moscow s statements on its actual nature as disinformation ù Who are its people?Times of London columnist Edward Lucas has been part of CEPA for years Poland chooses Raytheon Even if the missiles don t work, America will defend its customershttp:// tdotco /QwqrkCiosD The dedicated Cold Warrior doesn t appear to have spent much time in Russia for a long while and still seems to view the country through a prism which is very much rooted in the past Thus, he s more or less an out of touch dinosaur when it comes to Russia expertise He will soon be joined byBrian Whitmore, who comes on board from RFE/RL and appears to be even more ill informed than Lucas His work for the US state run broadcaster led to him being described as the Lord Haw Haw of Prague, ùwhere he has been based for some years CEPA is a pretty fluid organization and, until recently, Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsevwere also on its listof lobbyists The former is a Polish American Washington Post columnist who obsessively denigrates Russia and the latter has previously worked with the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which shows you how small and incestuous the Russia bashing world is Who pays for it?While other think tanks at least try to make their funding look semi organic, CEPA looks to have zero hang ups about its role as a mouthpiece for defence contractors Which is, at least, honest FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters and BAE systems pump funds in and they are joined by the US State Department and the Department of Defence Another notable paymaster is the National Endowment for Democracy regime change experts who are surely interested in CEPA s remit to also cover Belarus The US Mission to NATO and NATO s own Public Diplomacy Division also provide cash Founded:1972 What is it?Don t be fooled by the name, the German Marshall Fund (GMF) is a very American body these days with little input from Berlin It was founded by a donation from Willy Brandt s Bonn government to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Ironically, Brandt is today best remembered as the father of Ostpolitik , which sought a rapprochement between Germany and Russia What does it do?After the fall of the Soviet Union, the GMF transformed into a vehicle promoting US influence in Eastern Europe, with outreaches in Warsaw, Belgrade and Bucharest However, in the past 12 months, it s taken a very strange turn Following the election of US President Donald Trump (ironically a German American), the lobby group launched the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) project Its centerpiece is the Hamilton 68 Dashboard , which seems to classify social media users which reject the US liberal elite s consensus as Russian trolls ùThe reaction has been highly critical, with even the secretly funded Russian opposition website Meduzaasking how do you identify pro Russian amplifiers if themes dovetail with alternative American political views? ù Who are its people?TheGMF, especially through its new ASD plaything, has a high profile bunch of lobbyists They include Toomas Ilves, an American raised son of Estonian emigrants who once headed the Estonian desk at erstwhile CIA cut out Radio Free Europe and eventually became president of Estonia Also on board is Bill Kristol, known as the architect of the Iraq War and former CIA Director

figure annual sum This, of course, raises some questions about US taxpayers essentially funding the Hamilton 68 dashboard, which may be smearing Americans who don t agree with their government s policies as Russian agents The State Department also ponies up capital, asdoes NATOand Latvia s Defense Ministry Other interesting paymasters are George Soros, Airbus and Google While Boeing and the ubiquitous Raytheon are also involved Founded:2007 What is it?This lobby group could as easily be titled The Institute for the Promotion of War Unlike the others, it doesn t consider Russia its primary target, instead preferring to push for more conflict in the Middle East However, Moscow s increased influence in that region has brought the Kremlin into its crosshairs What does it do?The IFTSOW agitates for more and more American aggression It supported the Iraq surge and has encouraged more involvement in Afghanistan IFTSOW also focuses on Syria, Libya and Iran Just last week, one of its lobbyists, Jennifer Cafarella, † called for the US military to take Damascus, which would bring Washington into direct conflict with Russia and Iran US occupation of Damascus @TheStudyofWarseems to be calling for the US military to take Damascus and rebuild Syria This seems the only ""realistic"" policy that could produce its demand to rid Syria of Assad s government as well as Iranian and Russian influence pic twitter com/nmSTkSzb5G Who are its people?Kimberly Kagan is the brains behind this operation She s married to Frederick Kagan, who was involved in the neocon Project for the New American Century group along with his brother, Robert Kagan Which makes Kimberly the sister in law of Victoria f**k the EU ùNuland Another lobbyist is Ukrainian Natalia Bugayova, who was involved in Kiev s 2014 EuroMaidan coup She previously worked for the Kiev Post, a resolutely anti Russian newspaper which promotes US interests in Ukraine However, IFTSOW s most notorious lobbyist was Elizabeth O Bagy, who emerged as a Syria expert in 2013 and called for American political leaders to send heavy weaponry to Syrian insurgent groups She claimed to have a PhD from Georgetown University in Washington, DC, but this was fictional and once the media twigged to it, she was dismissed by the IFTSOW Two weeks later, she wasrewardedfor her deception by falling up to a job with fanatical Russophobe Senator John McCain O Bagy has alsocollaboratedwith the Atlantic Council s Michael Weiss, which is further evidence of how tight knit the world of US neoconservative advocacy really is Who pays for it?Predictably, Raytheonhas openedits wallet Meanwhile, other US military contractors like General Dynamics and DynCorp are also involved L3, which provides services to the US Department of

"25 Oct, 2017",‚ÄòRT is accused & guilty of providing content that appeals to people‚Äô,"People wouldn t be watching RT if it was not providing high quality news content and a much needed alternative viewpoint amid a mainstream media monopoly, media experts have told RT, noting that baseless criticism only fuels the channel s popularity On Monday, the New York Times (NYT) accused YouTube of having a cozy ùrelationship with RT, and which the publication believes, has contributed to the rise of the RT s popularity on the world s most visited video sharing site Thearticleclaims that YouTube has played a crucial role ùin helping RT expand and significantly grow its audience base Unacceptable! RT pulled from YouTube prime ad list in US without notice They had to attribute it to some form of collaboration or weird dealings because they couldn t just accept that RT is doing well by providing people [with] content that people will watch, ùMatteo Bergamini, the founder of independent youth news platform Shout Out UK, told RT Independent journalist Derrick Droze agreed that the only thing the NYT succeeded in doing with its latest piece, is in fact, praising RT s quality content and efficient partnership with YouTube It is kind of silly to see the New York Times and US government take this position because essentially what they are accusing RT of doing is knowing how to work YouTube, and knowing how to work algorithms and how to work content that appeals to people, ùDroze told RT The way the article is written is so silly They re just talking about that RT created content and it reached a young audience of people who want authenticity and who want real news, and who want news outside the US government s version of events, ùthe journalist added In particular, the NYT article criticized the compliments RT attracted from Robert Kyncl, who was YouTube s vice president at the time when RT smashed through the billion views milestone In particular, Kyncl emphasized that RT offers authentic ùnews content instead of agendas or propaganda, ùwhich helps the outlet to bond with its viewers I think what users generally appreciate is authenticity It is very apparent from everything that is going on on Youtube So instead of having aspirational programming or agendas and propaganda, people really respond to authenticity, ùKyncl told RT s Kevin Owen in 2013 The media experts agree with Kyncl s assessment offered years ago RT is popular because it services people, because people find it interesting, not because of some kind of brainwashing or collusion, ùlegal and media analyst Lionel said In fact, YouTube hascontinuedto commend RT s content selection, production and audience retention throughout the years †RTrocketedto 5 billion views on YouTube in September, maintaining its undisputed leadership position among international news networks, and outstripping by far the total number of views for BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera and Euronews Mouthpiece of neocon war machine : Freeman s War with Russia video creates stir on Twitterhttps:// tdotco /9YMzl6KYwepic twitter com/5g6qyW0Rqb And while experts and YouTube itself agree that RT is succeeding in building strong connections with its vast audience, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)echoedthe NYT assessment, accusing not only Google, but also Facebook and Twitter of allowing the Russian news outlet to post unreliable, misleading and highly partisan content ùAnd as is becoming customary, both outlets provided no concrete examples to back its claims Log out of Facebook Delete your Twitter Sleep with one eye open Russians are everywhere (Op Ed by Danielle Ryan)https:// tdotco /cDXBiqQs4B This kind of reporting by the WSJ and the NYT is tantamount to a witch hunt, ù Bergamini believes It s a witch hunt for anybody that has any relationship with anything to do with Russia or anything Russian it seems, ùBergamini said [To say] that RT because they were successful on YouTube is somehow embedded with YouTube and therefore Google is just madness [They] are choking out accusations without any real evidence whatsoever ù In a recent drive to somehow tarnish the public view of RT, a lobby group funded by George Soros, along with the EU and US governments, targeted 2,327 people who appeared as experts and guests on RT The report by the European Values think tank states that appearing on RT is counterproductive and makes the guest a useful idiot ùto a hostile foreign power ùExpressing one s opinion on RT is considered by the NGO as equivalent to complicity with the Russian propaganda machine ù But people are not idiots, ùand consciously chose to watch and appear on RT because the channel s content stands out from the mainstream media, argued Ray Finch, an MEP from the UK Independence Party (UKIP) The fact of the matter is: ordinary people know where to get their news They can choose anywhere they like It seems that RT is giving some form of news that people like, and so people are consuming it If they didn t like it, they are not forced to watch it, they can go and watch CNN or Al Jazeera or read the NYT online, ùFinch told RT CNN is known worldwide now as the Clinton News Network, the BBC is the voice of the remainers as far as Brexit is concerned, Russia Today is what it says on the tin, it is backed by Russia People take that into account The NYT and people like that are assuming people are idiots, ùFinch said Boris says Labour MPs speaking to RT is a scandal despite his dad appearing only last month Just last week, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed that it was a scandal ùfor Labour MPs to appear on RT However, every time RT makes western media headlines, the reaction to the popularity of the channel only seems to grow, Lionel noted If I didn t know better, I would swear RT is working on one of the most incredible stealth PR programs ever Every time the New York Times or the Washington Post or anybody else does some expos√© about RT, it makes people in this country even more interested and more fascinated with what RT does, ùLionel pointed out Since RT registered on YouTube in 2007, the network has been constantly expanding its online presence, bringing to its viewers the latest and most viral news in a wide range of video formats, while exploring new designs Last year, RT broke new ground in posting the first 360 degree HD video from aboard the International Space Station RT s most popular videos over the last year include Donald Trump s victory speech after winning the presidential election, an interview with the President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, and a documentary about a hitman who worked for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar RT s goal is, and has always been, to inform The hysteria surrounding such mundane activities as RT s social media advertising of its content î something done by practically all news organizations î speaks to the establishment s fear of losing the monopoly on information, and betrays a concerted effort to push RT out of the US market, ùRT said in astatementto the WSJ Smoking gun or nothingburger? WaPo claims Russia meddled in election through Google, YouTube Droze believes there is a more sinister agenda behind the ongoing anti RT campaign, and that is, to silence all alternative news flows It is bigger than just going after Russia, ùDroze said It is about alternative opinions and independent news that contradict the American audience They want to limit that view on YouTube They want to limit that view on Facebook ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/407690-rt-content-youtube-partnership/

Aside from being really famous, they are also united by the fact they ve appeared on RT And Monika Richter, an obsessive at a Czech based pressure group called European Values Think Tank, ùpurports to have compiled a list of all the leading western celebrities, journalists, commentators, academics and politicians who have featured on this network s programmes in recent years Something which you might think would come in handy, going forward, for new RT producers looking for potential guests, as it contains 2,327 names Except, alas, it s not really very accurate The haphazard, careless and shoddy compilation makes some bizarre mistakes, such as confusing British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for an actor impersonating him And, even more bizarrely, mistaking the legendary Larry King for the equally illustrious Larry David Not once, but dozens of times Badly implemented smear campaigns from various anti Russia lobbyists are nothing new But this attempt is especially inept Because it s so pockmarked with mistakes that it looks like it was knocked out in a weekend Which makes its opening suggestion on how politicians and media organisations should publiclly (sic) commit to a higher degree of fact checking rigour ù all the more remarkable in its speciousness Before going further, let s be clear about who pays for the activities of European Values ùand whoseintereststhis faux academic concern serves In 2015, its biggest single source of private funding was the veteran billionairevulture capitalistGeorge Soros (around 25% in total via two opensociety Foundation agencies) In Russia, the organization is considered so toxic that it has been banned as a security threat ùFurthermore, this viewpoint is not restricted to Moscow, as the government of his homeland, Hungary, has singled Soros out as an enemy of the state ùIndeed, even Israel concurs with this view, with its Foreign Ministry saying he continuously undermines Israel s democratically elected governments ù So, we know Soros is no friend of democracy Instead, he uses his vast fortune to interfere in sovereign states and undermine administrations he dislikes Which is ironically what Richter accuses RT of doing when she writes how RT s raison d √™tre is to denigrate the West at all costs and undermine public confidence in the viability of liberal democracy ùSomething which is completely untrue, given that the actual rationale behind RT is to present Russia s point of view Also, as it happens, Moscow has excellent relations with many other democracies including South Korea, India and Israel And is also on friendly terms with numerous individual europeanunion states even if, under pro American leaders in Berlin and Paris, the collective has effectively outsourced its foreign policy to the United States in recent years, rendering it automatically anti Russian Incidentally, aside from Soros, the other big donors to the European Values ù lobby group are the European Commission and Parliament and the embassies of the United States and the United Kingdom Thus, it doesn t take a genius to follow the money and see the agendas at play And it s instructive that Richter is alsoconnectedto the Atlantic Council, a large US political action body,bankrolledby the Ukrainian World Congress, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Raytheon Company andthe US State Department All entities that, of course, benefit from strained relations between Russia and the west Most of Richter s key claims make little sense She keeps accusing RT of disinformation ùbut provides no evidence of it being deliberate, merely highlighting a few factual mistakes over the years which are no more extraordinary than those of rival outlets Because there is no news organization that never gets it wrong The author also cites the US intelligence report on Russian electoral interference, a laughably misinformed document that has been dismissed by every credible western Russian expert And she continuously refers to guests as useful idiots; an incredible insult to fling at giants such as Kofi Annan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Peter Sutherland, Jeremy Corbyn and Wolfgang Ischinger, who have achieved far more in life than the author ever will, on this evidence European Values other big reveal is ùthat RT uses guest appearances by Western politicians, journalists and writers, academics, and other influential public personalities to boost its credibility ùWhich is actually not strictly true In reality RT, like all other TV stations, mainly does it to boost ratings, because, quite obviously, viewers would rather watch, say, Noam Chomsky (listed as Noah here in yet another error) opine on world affairs than some nobody who thinks the US government is beyond criticism Additionally, Richter accuses RT of anti Westernism (particularly anti Americanism) Which makes one wonder how she d describe American media coverage of Russia, if she were being truly honest The lobbyist then makes an astounding statement: RT never reports about Russia only about the failings and hypocrisies of Western society ùWhich is a complete lie, and if you doubt that, clickmy pictureon the top left of this page and you will see that the vast majority of my own writing on here is Russia centric Richter contradicts herself all over the shop For instance, she claims RT s impact on western audiences is minimal to modest, ùyet, a few lines later she warns how RT s specific effects ùon its viewers should be a research priority for all organizations and governments interested in countering the Kremlin s disinformation campaign ùAnd later she thunders that Russia s disinformation campaign, ùwhich allegedly includes RT s journalism, presents a security hazard ùthat should not be taken lightly ù but then says it s imperative ùnot to overinflate ùthe threat of RT Of course, the real agenda behind reports of this nature is often exposed by what they omit And on Saturday, the Prague based journalist Michael Colborne (who himself has written for Soros backed blogs) pointed out that the 52 page slander fest was full of qualifiers and also some arbitrariness with only persons deemed of sufficient public significance and repute are(sic)included This might explain why there s a few names missing, including two friends of European Values, who themselves have been on RT! ùhe added Colborne wasreferringto Julia Davis and Eric Garland, who are today known as particularly determined anti Russiaactivists, prominent on social media, with perspectives which conveniently mirror the lobby groups agenda This is just intellectually dishonest horseshit Framing every single person ever on RT as an idiot except your friends, conveniently, ùColborne continued Well, just fancy that!

"11 Sep, 2017",Korean nuclear tension: Apocalypse... almost now,"The saber rattling and harsh rhetoric during the current nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula should remind mankind of something we have forgotten Atomic weapons are terrifying things, and talk of using them should be a taboo subject is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London is a cultural philosopher He s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London A week or so ago, I found myself reading Agatha Christie s 80th, and penultimate, book, Passenger to Frankfurt, and its relevance to today struck me The book was published in 1970, with the subtitle an extravaganza, ùis an utter failure and was often characterized as an incomprehensible muddle ù; however, this muddle is not due to Christie s old age or senility: instead, its causes are clearly political Passenger to Frankfurt is Christie s most personal, intimately felt, and at the same time most political novel It expresses her personal confusion, her feeling of being totally at a loss with what was going on in the world in the late 1960s the drugs, the sexual revolution, student protests, murders, etc So it s no wonder that Passenger to Frankfurt is not a detective novel There is no murder, no logic, and deduction This feeling of the collapse of the elementary cognitive mapping, this overwhelming fear of chaos, is rendered precisely in Christie s introduction to the novel: Hold up a mirror to 1970 in England Look at that front page every day for a month, make notes, consider and classify Every day there is a killing A girl strangled An elderly woman attacked and robbed of her meager savings Young men or boys attacking or attacked Buildings and telephone kiosks smashed and gutted Drug smuggling Robbery and assault Children missing and children s murdered bodies found not far from their homes Can this be England? Is England really like this? Not yet, but it could be Fear is awakening, a fear of what may be And not only in our own country There are smaller paragraphs on other pages giving news from Europe, from Asia, from the Americas, in Worldwide News Hi jacking of planes Kidnapping Violence Riots Hate Anarchy All growing stronger All seeming to lead to worship of destruction, pleasure in cruelty What does it all mean? ù Is our era with † leaders ù †like Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? So what does all this mean? In the novel, Christie provides her answer a terrible worldwide conspiracy which has something to do with Richard Wagner and The Young Siegfried We learn that, toward the end of World War II, Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war He then escaped to Argentina where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel The Young Siegfried ùMeanwhile, in the book s present, drugs, promiscuity, and student protests are all secretly caused by Nazi agitators who want to bring about anarchy so that they can restore Nazi domination on a world scale This terrible worldwide conspiracy ùis, of course, ideological fantasy at its purest: a weird condensation of the fear of extreme right and extreme left The least we can say to Christie s credit is that she locates the heart of the conspiracy to the extreme right (neo Nazis) and not in any of the other usual suspects (Communism, Jews, Muslims, etc ) The idea neo Nazis were behind the 68 student protesters and sexual liberation struggle, with its obvious madness, nonetheless bears witness to the disintegration of a consistent cognitive mapping of our predicament Christie is compelled to take refuge in such a crazy paranoiac construct as the only way to introduce some order and meaning into the utter confusion and panic she found herself in But is her vision really too crazy to be taken seriously? Is our era with leaders ùlike Donald Trump and Kim Yong Un not as crazy as her vision? Are we today not all like a bunch of passengers to Frankfurt? Our situation is messy in a way very similar to the one described by Christie: a rightist government enforcing workers rights (in Poland), a leftist government pursuing the strictest austerity politics (in Greece) Thus, it s no wonder that, to regain a minimal cognitive mapping, Christie resorts to WWII, the last good war, ùretranslating our mess into its coordinates One should nonetheless note how the very form of Christie s answer (one big secret agent behind it all) strangely mirrors the fascist idea of the Jewish conspiracy: how there is one big Nazi plot behind which lies the explanation to everything And, today, the extreme populist right proposes a similar explanation of the Muslim immigrant threat ùIn antisemitic imaginary, the Jew ùis the invisible master who secretly pulls the strings, which is why Muslim immigrants are NOT today s Jews: they are all too visible, not invisible They are clearly not integrated into our societies, and nobody claims they secretly pull strings if one sees in their invasion of Europe ùa secret plot, then Jews have to be behind it As was the case in a text that recently appeared in one of the main Slovenian Rightist weekly journals where we could read: George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time, ùresponsible for the invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU as a typical Talmudo Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of Western civilization, the nation state and white, European man ù His goal is to build a rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work hating cultural Marxists, ùwhich would then perform a deconstruction of the nation state, and transform the EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe ùFurthermore, Soros is inconsistent in his promotion of multiculturalism: He promotes it exclusively in Europe and the USA, while in the case of Israel, he, in a way which is for me totally justified, agrees with its monoculturalism, latent racism and building a wall In contrast to the EU and USA, he also does not demand from Israel to open its borders and accept refugees A hypocrisy appropriate to Talmudo Zionism ù[Quoted from Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç, George Soros is one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time (in Slovene), Demokracija, August 25 2016, p 15 ] Is this disgusting fantasy which brings together antisemitism and Islamophobia so different from the one staged by Christie? Are they both not a desperate attempt to orient oneself in confused times? The extreme oscillations in the public perception of the Korean crisis are significant as such One week we are told we are on the brink of nuclear war, then there is a week of respite, then the war threat explodes again When I visited Seoul in August 2017, my friends there told me there is no significant threat of a war since the North Korean regime knows it cannot survive it, but now the South Korean authorities are preparing the population for a nuclear war In such a situation, where the apocalypse is on the horizon, one should bear in mind the standard logic of probability no longer applies, we need a different logic, described by Jean Pierre Dupuy: The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as destiny, for sure, but also as a contingent accident if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example, it could not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not occur, it is not inevitable It is thus the event s actualization the fact that it takes place which retroactively creates its necessity ù[ Jean Pierre Dupuy, Petite metaphysique des tsunami, Paris: Seuil 2005, p 19 ] Dupuy provides the example of the French presidential elections in May 1995; here is the January forecast of the main polling Institute: If on next May 8th, Mr (√âdouard) Balladur will be elected, one can say the presidential election was decided before it even took place ù The moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities When applied to the recent tension in Korea, this means: IF the war explodes, it will be necessary and inevitable; IF war will not explode, it was all a false alarm This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of nuclear (or ecological) catastrophe: not to realistically ùappraise the possibilities of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on the background of this acceptance, we should mobilize ourselves to perform the act which will change destiny itself and thereby insert a new possibility into the situation Instead of saying the future is still open, we still have the time to act and prevent the worst, ù one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable, and then work to undo what is already written in the stars ùas our destiny What is needed is no less than a new global anti nuclear movement, a global mobilization that would exert pressure on nuclear powers and act aggressively, organizing mass protests and boycotts, while denouncing our leaders as criminals and the like It should focus not only on North Korea but also on those super powers who assume the right to monopolize nuclear weapons The very public mention of the use of nuclear weapons should be treated as a criminal offense And more than that, a global change in our stance is needed, what Peter Sloterdijk calls the domestication of the wild animal culture ù Till now, each culture disciplined and educated its own members and guaranteed civic peace among them in the guise of state power, but the relationship between different cultures and states was permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each state of peace nothing more than a temporary armistice As Hegel conceptualized it, the entire ethic of a state culminates in the highest act of heroism, the readiness to sacrifice one s life for one s nation state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within a state Is today s North Korea with its ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons, and rockets to deliver them to distant targets, not the ultimate example of this logic of unconditional nation state sovereignty? However, the moment we fully accept the fact that we live on Spaceship Earth, the task that urgently imposes itself is that of civilizing civilizations themselves, of imposing universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities A task rendered all the more difficult by the ongoing rise of sectarian religious and ethnic heroic ùviolence and readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one s specific cause The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/402959-korean-nuclear-christie-apocalypse-zizek/
"7 Aug, 2017",Reports of Hungary‚Äôs slide into ‚Äòdictatorship‚Äô have been exaggerated,"Is Hungary sliding into tyranny and dictatorship? According to headlines which have painted a rather grim picture of Hungary s present and future under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the answer is a resounding yes is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ is an Irish freelance writer based in Dublin Her work has appeared in Salon, The Nation, Rethinking Russia, teleSUR, RBTH, The Calvert Journal and others Follow her on Twitter@DanielleRyanJ Hungary is held hostage ùby tyrant ùOrban who is returning the country to totalitarianism, ùclaims The New Statesman The International Business Times worries about Hungary s dark path toward dictatorship ù The EU struggles to contain dictator ùOrban, says the Sydney Morning Herald Orban is Europe s enemy within, ùwarns the Financial Times He is Europe s New Dictator, ùsays Politico These attention grabbing headlines and dramatic portrayals exaggerate the political situation in Hungary Of course, there are plenty of legitimate complaints to be made about Orban (though, naturally, the specifics of the complaint will vary based on who is speaking) The problem is that the media has taken those complaints, exaggerated and embellished them, and used them to predict this country s slide into absolute tyranny irresponsibly This distorts reality and lessens the readers ability to understand what is going on in Hungary Brussels likes to believe it promotes democracy within the 28 EU member states Yet, when Orban begins to implement policies that they don t like (but that his voters support), he becomes an outcast Those shouting dictator! ùfail to take into account the wishes of the many Hungarians who voted for Orban s reelection in 2014 and who support many of his policies Disregarding the will of the people to score ideological points about democracy is ironic indeed Let s break it down Hungarian PM Orban pledges to support Poland against European inquisition https:// tdotco /9GAoCzB8TE When considering the legitimacy of the claim that Hungary is sliding into dictatorship, we should start with the basics Orban is a legitimately elected prime minister The freeness of recent elections in Hungary has not been called into question Following the latest parliamentary elections in 2014, which saw Orban and his conservative political alliance re elected, there was debate (within Hungary, I should add) over whether undue advantage was given to the ruling Fidesz party through acombination of factors î including gerrymandering districts and biased media reporting No doubt these factors do give an advantage to the ruling party, but it would not be entirely unfair to compare this to the undue advantage afforded to the two mainstream parties in the United States Democrat and Republican candidates enjoy massive free media coverage and an immediate sense of legitimacy, while third party candidates are all but shunned and treated as an amusing sideshow by mainstream media The US regards itself as the greatest democracy in the world As for gerrymandering, it ishardlya Hungarian phenomenon Overall, the OSCE monitors of Hungary s parliamentary electionsconcludedthat Hungarians were offered a genuine choice ùin competitive elections ùThey said the process was transparently and efficiently administered ù The OSCE criticized the partisan composition ùof the National Election Commission and media regulations which favored Fidesz but said the candidate registration process was inclusive Interestingly, Western coveragefocused onlyon the OSCE s criticisms, failing to give a full picture which included improvements to the system Ultimately, when Hungary holds elections, candidates from across the political spectrum win seats î from the governing party, from the left and right wing opposition î and occasionally independents Sometimes the polls predict outcomes accurately, other times they are off None of this is typical of a dictatorship One of the major criticisms of Orban is that he has destroyed free media in Hungary It is true that Hungary s media environment is not free from state interference State media act, by and large, as free advertising and propaganda for Fidesz and Orban There is often pressure put on independent media and Orban allies have been busybuying upmedia outlets Nonetheless, it is completely untrue to suggest that Orban has managed to decimate the free press entirely There are plenty of available outlets that dedicate a lot of their time to bashing the ruling party, online and in print and radio Independent journalists regularly unearth cases of government corruption î and anyone is free to read them Hungarians are more than aware of government corruption and are not happy about it Public opinion in 2016 showed that 56 percent of people believe the government only pursues corruptionselectively In 2014, the governmentshelved a planto introduce a tax on internet data usage after pressure through massive street protests The protesters argued that levying fees on internet usage would restrict access to free information î and the protesters won At the time, the BBCwrotethat Orban was more flexible than many analysts give him credit for ùTypically, street protests don t work in dictatorships If international rankings are your cup of tea, take a look at the 2017 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index Hungary does not rank particularly well î but Greece, Israel and Japanrank worse One of the biggest criticisms of Orban came this year over the controversy surrounding the George Soros founded, Budapest based Central European University The controversy was caused by an amendment to the law on higher education which meant the university would no longer be allowed to issue diplomas accredited in the United States unless it operated a campus there Until now, it has been allowed to do just that This naturally made the university highly marketable to students But non CEU students were at a disadvantage, according to the government s argument The law change was framed as a total and utter assault on freedom Reports in Western publicationsmade it soundas though the university was being forced to shutter its doors on the spot for no reason î or simply because of its association with Orban foe Soros In reality, the university will not be forced to close It will be compelled to comply with a new law which removes part of its competitive advantage (issuing US accreditation) Whether you believe this is fair or not, it is hard to argue the reporting on the controversy gave a full and balanced picture The law prompted huge street protests; some of the biggest Budapest has seen in years There is no question a lot of Hungarians are fired up against Orban over the CEU move But that is not the opinion across the board While on the one hand, I ve seen Hungarians waving signs comparing Orban to Hitler, I ve also spoken to Hungarians who support the amendment to the education law, completely agreeing with the position that CEU should not be afforded any sort special treatment Calling Orban a dictator or tyrant over something like this again disregards widespread opinion in favor of ideological point scoring An opinionpollin May saw the ruling party and Orban s personal support drop since the CEU spat in January î but that could also be to do with other things; like the fact that half of all Hungarians can t afford a one week foreign holiday Israel backs Hungary s anti Soros campaign, saying financier continually undermines Jewish State https:// tdotco /ksOiPRdcQt The policy that has caused Orban to be most reviled by many Western democracies, however, has been his decision to refuse to comply with an EU resettlement plan for hosting refugees across member states But again, Orban is not alone in his thinking A referendum in 2016 saw 98 percent of Hungarian voterssay no to Brussels EU migrant quotas Turnout, however, was low, at about 44 percent î below the 50 percent required to make the referendum valid under the law Orban s commentary on refugees has beeninflammatory; some would argue outright racist But racist and inflammatory commentary doesn t make one a dictator î especially when 98 percent of people who showed up to vote agree with you Regardless, Hungary is pushing ahead with its stance on illegal immigration, even holding those who enter the country in detention centers at the border The government claims it is doing this to uphold the Schengen agreement which is being abused ùas migrants travel freely to reach their country of choice in Western Europe The country also built a fence along its border with Serbia hoping to lower the number of refugee crossings This again is a subject which deeply divides people and ignites passions But believing Orban s policies on migration are cruel or immoral does not make him a dictator What s more, it s ludicrous to ignore that his policies are in line, for the most part, with the will of the people Incidentally, Orban is also accused of fueling extremism and anti Semitism While he certainly does whip up nationalist fervor, it is misleading to call him an anti Semite It israrelypointed out that Orban s government introduced a Holocaust memorial day, compulsory Holocaust education in schools and made Holocaust denial illegal Western reporting frequently fails to give a full picture of the situation in Hungary in much the same way it does about any country that fails to live up to arbitrarily set standards for what constitutes a good or a bad country Unfortunately, some in the Hungarian opposition fuel unbalanced portrayals of the country because the louder they shout, the more vehement Western journalists will shout with them î and the more attention they will receive What I have been struck by, having spent the last ten months in this country, is that this is not the way average Hungarians seem to think of their country Many are of course vehemently anti Orban, many are pro Orban But even those against him are often baffled by Western coverage The late Imre Kertesz, the first Hungarian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature,decried talk of dictatorshipin Hungary as empty ideological language ù In a 2014 interview with The Hungarian Quarterly, Kertesz revealed that a reporter from the New York Times had called him with the intention of getting me to say that Hungary is a dictatorship today, which it isn t ù That only means that he [the reporter] has no idea what a dictatorship is If you can write, speak openly, openly disagree, even leave the country, it is absurd to speak of a dictatorship, ùKertesz said I am not pleased with everything happening in Hungary I do not think there was ever a time when I was pleased with everything happening here but certainly, Hungary is no dictatorship This is empty ideological language to call Hungary a dictatorship today ù Most notably, Kertesz said the interview in which he failed to call his country a dictatorship was never published î and that in itself is a kind of censorship ù Exaggerating Hungary s political situation distorts not only the present but the past To speak of Orban s dictatorship ùis a slap in the face to those who lived and still do live under real dictatorships The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization

truth, and the truth is that Russia is under threat from the EU rather than the other way round, based on the EU s increasing role as the political arm of the NATO military alliance of which Turkey, to remind Mr Soros, also happens to be a member It is not that Russia is actively hostile to the EU it is that Russia has been defending itself from the hostility of the EU In this regard, the sanctions imposed on Russia after the EU and its officials actively supported an undemocratic coup in Ukraine in 2014 is a double injustice, bringing George Soros bald assertion of Russia as the bad guy into disrepute READ MORE: Cuban Missile Crisis 2 0: Russia s surrounded by NATO bases and US missile systems This being said, Mr Soros is right to point out that if the europeanunion carries on with business as usual, there is little hope for an improvement That is why the europeanunion needs to be radically reinvented ù The crisis that has engulfed the EU is the product of free market fundamentalism, otherwise known as neoliberalism, being embraced as a secular religion by the liberal elite over the past few decades It is precisely the ability of capital to move around the world back and forth across borders, seeking the best return on investment, which has wrought so much chaos and instability to the self evident detriment of millions of working people It is this economic instability that has been the key push factor behind mass immigration over the same period George Soros and his ilk have enriched themselves from this state of affairs, contributing to its egregious impact on national economies and social cohesion in the process European integration as a concept is impossible to argue with However, the EU as it currently stands is clearly dysfunctional and out of sync with the needs of the vast majority of its citizens It is being run in the interests of a neoliberal elite that consider national sovereignty and political stability anathema to the priority of being able to rake as much of a return from short term investment as and where the opportunity arises It is this perverse and grotesque interpretation of freedom and liberty that has dominated the institutions of the EU, plunging them into crisis in the wake of the global economic crisis of 2007/08 The result of the crisis within neoliberalism has been the growth of anti politics or to be more specific anti politics as usual that was embodied in the decision of the British people to exit the EU (Brexit) in 2016, and in the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States later in the same year European integration without Russia is a political oxymoron It is an oxymoron that has underpinned the EU in service, not to the economic or political needs of Europe s citizens but instead in obeisance to the needs of Washington and the unipolar world that has obtained since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 Thus we have European governments that have chosen to worship at the feet of Rome i e Washington with all of its consequences when it comes to peace and security while attacking Russia as the cause of those consequences when in truth it has been the biggest victim of them George Soros and everything he represents could never be part of the solution to the crisis within the EU On the contrary, Soros is part of the problem Until European governments recognize this, recognize that the failings of the EU are indistinguishable from the failings of neoliberalism; they are dealing with a crisis that will only deepen going forward

might say about Viktor Orb n, he s a fast and decisive mover Last Sunday, when thousands demonstrated in Budapest against his proposal to tighten regulation on foreign universities, marchers spoke of a lengthy campaign of resistance Two days later, it was a done deal orban had rushed the bill through parliament, displaying an efficiency Angela Merkel would admire, if she didn t distrust him for other reasons His target was Soros, Hungary s wealthiest son, who has become a hate figure for nationalists across Europe And a man who divides a country Many Hungarians admire Soros s philosophy and see him as a benefactor However, more again see his influence as nefarious and reject his ethos of globalist Atlanticism For liberals, Hungary has been a huge disappointment Because, back in the early 90 s, it was considered the most westernized of the ex Warsaw pact states And only 20 years ago, the Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats held an overwhelming majority in parliament Yet, with the country facing bankruptcy, they were forced †to implement a hugely unpopular austerity package that allowed orban s Fidesz party to jump from 20 to 148 seats in the 1998 election For the next decade, the two blocs fought a close battle until the latter took control in 2010, with the Socialists mortally wounded by accusations of rampant corruption, which even led to riots Since then, orban used his huge 2010 majority to change the constitution and has proven himself something of a chameleon For instance, he has simultaneously cultivated close relations with both Vladimir Putin and Poland s hyper patriotic government And although Russian companies have won significant contracts in the transportation and energy sectors, every time anti Moscow sanctions have come before the europeanunion , Budapest has faithfully backed them Inside the EU, Hungary s attitude to migrants has often created outrage For instance, when Angela Merkel was opening Germany s doors, orban was constructing a wall to keep the newcomers out However, Fidesz, politically connected to Merkel s CDU movement through Brussels European People s Party grouping, has paradoxically proven to be its most loyal supporter in European parliament votes Fidesz MEPs vote 98 percent with us even more than the Germans, an EPP officialtoldPolitico this week †This displays the genius of orban s double game Because while he s been busy dismantling liberal democracy in Hungary, EU grant aid has kept rolling in, averaging 2 4 percent of GDP from 2004 2014 And discontent in Brussels has been measured in murmurs, rather than roars Even the Americans seem relatively quiet, meekly observing this week how Washington is disappointed by the accelerated passage of legislation targeting (the) Central European University ùAt the same time, his government s overtures to Donald Trump, which it considers a like minded potential ally, have been met with silence While everybody knows that orban s obvious desire is to clip Soros wings, the actual legislation itself is slightly more vague It forces foreign universities to close unless there s a bilateral agreement in place between Hungary and their home ùgovernment and they have a campus abroad In the case of the Central European University, the only option is to open a mothership in the US or head for the hills As a result, other locations, in Austria, Romania and Lithuania, have been offering themselves as alternatives The CEU was founded in 1991 in Prague, before former President Vaclav Klaus booted it out a few years later Back then its stated mission was to educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region ùBy the year 2000, it had moved onto a special emphasis on democracy promotion and human rights ùAmong its alumni are Azeri dissidents Ilgar Mammadov and †Rashadat Akhundov, Serbian pro NATO activist Srƒëan Cvijiƒá and current Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili Thus, many local influencers fear Budapest has been hosting its own colour revolution ùfactory orban and Soros have had their share of mutual grievances Two years ago, the Prime Minister accused the billionaire of being responsible for the migrant crisis His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything

to influence Hungarian politics, ù orban s party is fully on board Fidesz deputy chairman, Szilard Nemeth,said †in December that Donald Trump s US election win was a game changer: these organisations must be pushed back with all available tools, and I think they must be swept out And now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election ù As for the two heavy hitters themselves, while both are Hungarian, they couldn t be more different Soros is a billionaire, whose $25 billion fortune is worth about 20 percent of his homeland s entire GDP He was raised in an upper middle class home in Budapest, his father a lawyer and his mother from a wealthy family of silk traders At the age of 17, he left Hungary and migrated to Britain, where he studied at London s School of Economics Ten years later, New York beckoned and, by his late 30s, Soros had founded his own fund management company By contrast, orban is a country boy Hailing from the rural county of Fejer, where his father worked in agriculture, he studied law in Budapest However, such was his dislike for city life that, upon graduation, he immediately relocated to a country town, Szolnok, and commuted into the capital for work In 1989, he spent a few months at Oxford University, ironically on a Soros scholarship, but quickly returned to Hungary to enter politics Soros once said he hoped that his foundation would help Hungary become a country from which I wouldn t want to emigrate ùIt seems, at the age of 86, his mission to fashion his homeland s politics to his own agenda has failed That said, the majority of Hungarian voters appear to be supportive of orban s ambition to create an illiberal, nationalist state, within the europeanunion And there s no doubting how the politician is

The bestial, brutal, and near sui generis barbarism that has engulfed Syria over the past six years is the product of the destabilization of the region caused by the 9/11 wars their series of wars and conflicts unleashed and which have erupted in the wake of the terrorist atrocity planned and carried out by Al Qaeda against the US in 2001 In what has to count as the irony of our time, rather than succeed in destroying the threat of terrorism and ideology of Al Qaeda, Washington, and its allies have only succeeded in ensuring its growth and intensification Frankly put, their determination to exploit 9/11 as a pretext for regime change in the Middle East opened the gates of hell out of which the monster of Salafi jihadism emerged bent on genocide and death and destruction as an end in itself The grievous consequences are there for all to see in the shape of a refugee crisis that parallels the one that followed in the wake of the Second World War, religious sectarianism and extremism, the proliferation of terrorism, both regional and international, and human suffering on a scale that makes a mockery of the term Western civilization Further on in the MSC report, we encounter the following: Donald Trump s comments about NATO being obsolete ù have caused great uncertainty among America s allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe The europeanunion is under pressure, too, as it has to deal with Brexit, a populist surge, the refugee crisis, a potential return of the euro crisis, jihadist attacks, and a revisionist Russia ù Again, we are confronted with evidence of an intellectual disjuncture between the cherished beliefs of champion of liberal hegemony and reality NATO is not the force for universal peace, security, or democracy and freedom that its adherents proclaim It is in truth a military alliance concerned with the projection of Western imperialist power, one that carries a baneful legacy of regime change i e in the former Yugoslavia and Libya It is a relic of the Cold War that has in recent years been resurrected and elevated in importance in line with a return to a Cold War paradigm embraced with the objective of deflecting from the political, economic and geopolitical wreckage liberal democratic values and norms have wrought In other words, Russia is being held up as a convenient bogeyman around which people in the US and Western Europe are being encouraged to cohere, painted as a threat to their security and national interests As George Orwell wrote, War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength ù No right thinking person is opposed to the concept of a united, stable, and secure Europe How could they when such a Europe is in everyones interest But the main impediment to achieving this unity, stability, and security is the idea that Russia cannot and should not be part of the solution in this regard, and must be viewed as part of the problem What they describe as a revisionist Russia ùis really code for a Russia that refuses to bend at the knee to Western imperialism, domination, and hegemony Replace revisionist ùwith strong, ùand you arrive at the real problem that Western liberal imperialists have with Russia in 2017 They much prefer the country that was ravaged and decimated by free market fundamentalists in the early 1990s, exploiting the chaos and shock in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union to conduct a mass experiment in human despair on an entire society Russia s recovery from this dark decade is one that has never been forgiven by the likes of Javier Solana, David Miliband, and George Soros, each of whom sits on the MSC advisory council The contents of the 2017 MSC report merely confirm that there is nothing more illiberal than a liberal for whom the world is one giant chessboard upon which states, governments, and entire peoples are mere pieces to be moved around at their behest ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/377466-munich-security-trump-russia-eu/
"13 Feb, 2017",Merkel breaking German law & endangering the country ‚Äì OSCE Assembly ex-VP,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has been dominating the German and European political landscape for over a decade But after years of economic and refugee crises, unpopular decisions, and a growing divide between EU members, Merkel is facing opposition inside her country and across the Atlantic as well With anti establishment forces strong across Europe and a new leader in America, how will the German political landscape shape up this year? And with the new president in Germany standing against confrontation with Russia should we be ready for a policy shift? We ask the former vice president of the OSCE Assembly, and former state secretary to Germany s defense minister Willy Wimmer Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Willy Wimmer, former vice head of OSCE Assembly, and former State Secretary to Germany s Defence Minister, welcome to the show, it s really great to have you with us Now, The Federal election to determine the new Chancellor is coming up in September and Angela Merkel s top contender Martin Schulz has promised to turn the vote into a real thrill , positioning himself as a man of the people With Merkel already under attack for her immigration policies, is Schulz going to destroy her chances for a fourth term? Willy Wimmer:At least, we get an interesting situation in Germany, and it depends on, on one side, on the polls, which are very interesting in this moment, but on the other side it depends on three elections in Federal States, in March, and in May, in the Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia, which is one of the most important Federal States in Germany They will have the election in May, and I think, these three elections we face in Federal States will have a major influence on the situation in September That s an inner German situation There s another situation coming from our West European neighbors We will have the first election in the Netherlands in March and then we will have presidential race in France, in May, and all these results will have a major effect on the inner German situation, because in the this very moment we all have the feeling, when it comes to Europe, that we live on a hand grenade It can explode every second and this will have a major influence on the German elections in September SS:Schulz is promising to focus on working people s concerns, going after EU freeloaders like Hungary is he taking a page out of Trump s playbook in this campaign? WW:No, I think, when it comes to the inner situation in Germany and in the EU, we have to realise that as a result of the reforms of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, we face a very critical situation inside our own societies The rich people are getting more rich, and the middle class and the poor people in Germany, they are getting poorer Therefore, I think, we have a debate inside our own society about social justice, and those parties might succeed who take on these issues and Schulz is, perhaps, realising, that in the last 10 15 years, the Social democraticparty no longer was the party of social justice but of establishment, the rule of the rich Therefore, it s normal to re adjust the direction of the Social democraticparty SS:Berlin accuses Russia of interfering in German politics in a bid to influence the federal vote † even though intelligence services say they found no evidence of cyberattacks and misinformation spread by Russia Is Russia just being used a tool in the election campaign? WW:I think, it is more than just using Russia as a tool I think we have a disastrous situation in the EU, and we face, since some years, the situation where they do their utmost to create a hostile situation against Russian Federation, and when it comes to the press and when it comes to influencing population, they used, really, Moscow as a tool for their own purpose, and therefore, I think, it s so interesting that even the German Security Service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) just told the public that there s no influence by the Russian Federation which looks like a campaign of disinformation So, I think, now they face, in Berlin or in Brussels, an interesting situation Again, they have to deal with their own problems and not to use Moscow as an excuse SS:Germany s vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, has said that Russia and the U S should find common ground but not at the expense of Europe what does he mean, what kind of damage would a U S Russia rapprochement cause Europe? WW:There s an ongoing fear in Western Europe since decades They fear two things: the first is to start a war and have a European battlefield and the second fear is to face something like U S Russian condominium on Europe When you mentioned, Gabriel, the second position might be important to him This is an ongoing debate in Western Europe and we had it already at the time of the Cold War SS:Germany s foreign minister was the first to meet with America s newly appointed secretary of State Rex Tillerson after relations between Trump and Chancellor Merkel started off with a spat over the executive order travel ban Will the foreign ministers be able to tame their bosses passions on this? WW:It is a quite unusual situation Normally, German government or German Chancellors had excellent relations to U S President SS:Yeah WW:And I hope they will have excellent relations to Russian Presidents as well But, this time, it is unbelievable In the campaign in the U S , we always had two camps and the German government had good relations to both of these camps For the first time in modern German history, the Federal Chancellor in Berlin, Angela Merkel, had no relations at all to the camp of later President Trump, and therefore we face the situation in our own internal politics and our external politics as well, that we have difficult relations to the new U S government and this is not good for our relations with the U S and not good for our relations with other European countries You see it already when it comes to our relationship with Great Britain Yes, they celebrate a special relationship and what is the result in Berlin? A hostile situation, and when you look back to the first telephone call between Angela Merkel and President Trump, it was shot before the outbreak of hostilities That is not in our German interest SS:Berlin came under fire from Trump s administration, with trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Germany s export policy, calling the euro a disguised Deutsch Mark, and accusing Berlin of unfairly profiting from the undervalued currency Will the White House be able to push Germany on this? Will Berlin cave or go head on into a trade war? WW:I think we have no interest in having a trade war with the U S , and we already experienced similar situations in our history in the last 60 70 years, when we had big projects together with the Soviet Union, these projects were not in favor and not in the interests of the U S , but nevertheless we did it and therefore, when we hear these words coming across the Atlantic yes, there might be critical situations, but we have to take our own national decisions on everything which has to do with our economical situation We are better off as a result of German reforms in the field of economy than other European and international partners We have to look for a fair situation for everybody, but the Americans can t blame Germans for doing better business than themselves It s up to the international World Trade Organisation rules and the international rules on fair trade as such and therefore, we have to deal with a fair situation not only between Washington and Brussels, or Washington and Berlin That s the reality SS:Berlin is saying it s going to boost military spending after Donald Trump lashed out against NATO states, including Germany, for not paying their fair share in the alliance does Germany need to invest more in defence? WW:When it comes to the reality in Europe, we face a more critical situation NATO is outdated, not only because of the remarks of President Trump that NATO is obsolete NATO is outdated because the European Parliament, the European population never in history voted for NATO as an aggressive alliance NATO was a defensive alliance and should be restricted on German territory as such What we see in these days is NATO at the Russian Western border This was never in our interest and is never backed by international rules and regulations NATO left the legal structure in 90s because of the illegal war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia If President Trump wants to have a debate on the situation and the legal structure and the role of NATO as such I think he is very much invited to do so, and it would be in favour of the European Union population SS:Should Trump s criticism of NATO be a wake up call for Europe to start taking its own defence more seriously, and not just cling onto the Pentagon for its security? WW:When it comes to the European situation, I think we face a very interesting general situation when it comes to our neighbours Since the end of the Cold War, we were happy to live in an environment where we only had friends on our borders To the West and to the East and to the North and to the South When we really continue with such a kind of a policy, it s not a question of how strong the European military will be, whether it s under control of the U S or whether it s under the control of the European Union I think we have more things to do in Europe than just concentrating on the military When we face today s situation and look on our neighbourhood, what happened since 1990s, with the war against Yugoslavia, we are in U S led wars throughout the region between Afghanistan and Mali and we killed people by thousands and we are upset when they try to save their lives and come to us That is the situation since 99 and therefore I think we missed the big opportunity we had, not only because of the end of the Cold War, but of the Charter of Paris of November 1990 where we all promised each other only to have peace in Europe Therefore, I think, we have to go back to the Charter of Paris situation, and we can do it I think, when Moscow and Washington will find the way to communicate in a better way than Obama and the Bush administration did it years ago I think it depends on the U S how to organise a better policy in Europe compared to the situation we had in 1990s Therefore, I think, we should not concentrate on building up NATO even more and on a global scale We have to go back to our own interests and we have to deal, on one side, with Washington, and on the other side, with our Russian neighbours SS:Many EU diplomats once again reiterated their support for keeping anti Russian sanctions in place At the same time, Trump hinted the U S could lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for good deals with President Putin If Trump has his way, do you think the EU will have no choice but to follow suit? WW:When you look in the German population, when you look in the population of all countries which belong to the EU people and the population at all, the don t have any kind of understanding of the sanctions The sanctions are in place because of the coup d etat in Kiev which has been organised by the West Why do we have sanctions against the Russian Federation? There s no reason We hurt our relationship, we hurt our own interests, and we fit into the interests of others, on the other side of the Atlantic, who are very known to the public I think, in the very moment, when President Trump will lift the sanctions against the Russian Federation, we will forget about sanctions in the EU, at that very moment SS:There s opposition to Russia tie mending both in Brussels and in Washington You ve mentioned in a recent interview the Äúwar establishment Äù of Washington that is trying to block Trump s attempts to reconcile with Russia and be in generally less hawkish than usual Do you think this war establishment will triumph, and prevent Trump from doing what he wants? WW:It s what we see in this very moment in the U S In my opinion, here s one target: not to see President Trump organising better relations which are possible, and which are in our interests with regard to the Russian Federation and with regard to President Putin That is their main target, and I think it was outstanding, some days ago, when American president Trump accused his own Senators, from his own Republican party senator McCain and senator Graham to organise the outbreak of the WWIII I think we never heard this before and this explains to the rest of the world what s going on in the U S : it s a battle about war and peace Trump is peace and McCain is war and these are the words of the U S President SS:While Chancellor Merkel denounced Trump s travel ban on majority Muslim states, Bavaria s leader Horst Seehofer praised Trump s decisiveness, the Alternative for Germany party called it a model policy are drastic measures like this effective? WW:I have some understanding of the rivalry between Berlin and Washington, but not in a way that I support the policy of Federal Chancellor Merkel President Trump is very outspoken about having secure borders, and this is in the interests of the German people and this is in the interests of the European population as a whole We are interested in having secure borders, no wars on the other side of the border and no refugees coming by hundred of thousands to our countries We should help them to live in their own countries and not destroy and not destroy the future of these people I think we are totally on the wrong side of history when it comes to the Western policy over the last 25 years Therefore, we have to re organise almost everything and the reason why Merkel is so hostile against President Trump is because she is a spearhead of the policy of Obama, McCain, Soros and others when it comes to our relation with the Russian Federation That is the reason behind everything, we have to realise in Western Europe SS:Germany has experienced terrorism first hand with the Berlin Christmas market attack However, calls from the country s interior minister to centralise Germany s security structure have been met with criticism why? Right now each of Germany s 16 states has its own intelligence service is that effective? WW:I think we have to deal with questions like that and we have to concentrate on an effective structure of our state, of the EU as a whole But when the Federal Chancellor herself is not acting on the legal base when it comes to the migration development she got rid of German and European laws in September of 2015 She didn t put in effectiveness into the German law, again, after this crisis which came from Budapest railway station Now, our borders are open and that is the reason why we have all these troubles not because the intelligence service or security service has no realistic structure in our own country We have to go to the basis of all these problems we have, and this is a Federal Chancellor who s not acting on the basis of our own law The PM of Bavaria called this government ""a government acting on an unlawful situation"" and this expresses all SS:One of the problems laid bare by the Berlin attack was the country s inability to swiftly return migrants who don t qualify for asylum the attacker was a Tunisian migrant who was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia didn t want him Why is Berlin willing to compromise its security by allowing everybody in? WW:There s the great question in Germany and nobody has the answer to that because the Federal Chancellor, for two years, didn t explain her policy to the German population, and an outstanding and interesting situation in the German Parliament is that they didn t want her to be expressing her views in the Federal German Parliament We live in a situation where we never lived in before the German government has to be based on our own laws When we allow the Federal Chancellor to do her own business, we are facing a critical situation and when it comes to hundreds of thousands of people of whom we don t know that they are in the country, of whom we don t know about their names, their background I think we never saw, in modern European history, a country being organised like this and therefore, I think, when we face all these critical situations when it comes to Berlin and when it comes to 9/11, when it comes to the situation in Paris or in London or in Madrid we have to blame our own governments for not obeying our own laws Therefore we have all these security problems SS:Alright Mr Wimmer, thank you very much for this interview, we were talking to Willy Wimmer, former State Secretary to Germany s Defense minister, former vice President of the OSCE Assembly, discussing the continent s security issues and Germany s efforts to tackle them That s it for this edition of SophieCo, I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/377152-anti-establishment-forces-europe/
"10 Feb, 2017",EU wake-up call: ‚ÄòMajority of Europeans want Trump-style clampdown on immigration‚Äô,"President Trump promised an immigrant ban to vet new arrivals He delivered on his pledge, and we see the majority of Americans approve We see most Europeans also want such a policy, said Michael Modrikamen leader of the Belgian People s Party The international affairs think tank Chatham Housereleased a pollsuggesting the majority of people in ten EU countries would support an immigration ban on Muslim majority countries The survey was held before President Trump signed his controversial executive order doing just that in the US RT:We saw a few protests in Europe in response to Trump signing the immigration ban But we also now have a poll showing people would support a halt in migrants from Muslim countries Are you surprised the majority of people are alarmed by the issue? Most Europeans support migration ban for Muslim countries pollhttps:// tdotco /uVsj6QP6Pz Michael Modrikamen:I am not at all surprised because previous polls were indicating the same concern from Europeans all across Europe It just confirms that European citizens still have good sense, know directly in which direction they want to go Unfortunately our leaders both at the EU level, but also at the national level are totally detached from the concerns of the citizens Indeed, there is what I would call a real abyss between what the citizens expect and what our politician leaders propose RT:Angela Merkel was an architect for an open door Europe, wasn t she? MM:Yes, obviously she is also out of touch You know what is surprising? That everybody looks appalled by the fact that Trump did first what he had promised to do And this is what we expect also in Europe He promised a ban in order to vet the people and put the proceedings He delivered, and we see that the majority of Americans also approve [it ] And then we see that most Europeans would also expect such a policy RT:Yet, the ban is not in place MM:It is not in place because of judicial activism You have to know that for sure part of the Americans do not approve it But you have to know also that all the riots and all the events are for most of them organized and funded notably by Mr [George] Soros, a billionaire with a very liberal agenda We see also this kind of judicial activism In this situation, they came and clearly picked up very progressive judge that came with a very astonishing judgment in order to suspend Mr Trump s order, which is also appalling How can a judge, which is totally unelected at this stage just be able to suspend the decision made by the President, who is elected by the majority of Americans at least, according to the system? We see by the way the same judicial activism in Europe with the Syrian visa in Belgium at the court of justice would like to have issued The will of the people should prevail It is not for the judges to rule, but the politicians ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/376942-europe-migration-poll-chatham/

"30 Jan, 2017",Go figure: Soros-funded watchdog says populist politicians 'undermine fight against corruption',"With the EU elite threatened by a populist insurgency aiming to end free and easy immigration programs and promote nationalism over globalism, an influential think tank says populism will only wait for it fuel the fires of corruption Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Transparency International, a Berlin based anti graft group, warned in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index about the purported perils of populism, a political animal that on occasion rolls through nations like a force of nature to contend with the excesses of an out of touch, elitist minority Populism is the wrong medicine, statedTI chair Jose Ugaz, without offering any alternative prescriptions In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civilsociety , limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems, Ugaz continued With regards to corruption, the watchdog attempts mind reading by asserting that populist politicians have no intention of tackling the problem [of corruption] seriously The report takes to task some firebrand politicians, including Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jaroslw Kaczynski (Poland) and Victor Orban (Hungary), among others, who are currently topping the popularity charts among their constituents by declaring open season on the moribund establishment Transparency International sounded the alarm over these political con artists who are reactive, nativist and often right wing while alleging that these disruptive newcomers have been able to exploit the disenchantment of people with the corrupt system and present themselves as the only way out of the vicious cycle described While deliberating upon the potential risks associated with the new agitators on the block, the report conspicuously failed to mention the reasons why so many voters today are disaffected with the same old run of the mill politicians, who are guilty, it must be said, of far worse crimes than mere corruption In all too many cases we are talking about complicity in actual atrocities, from bloody regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, with efforts underway in Syria, to the wholesale destruction of Western civilization due to the unchecked immigration of war refugees without the consent of the governed If NATO member states are feeling pangs of guilt over their direct complicity in the serial murders of nation states, forcing the refugees of these war zones onto the territory of their people is undoubtedly not the answer In light of these unsavory actions on the part of many NATO countries, concerns over high level corruption may seem a bit exaggerated and misplaced At the risk of sounding cynical, separating corruption from the world of politics is tantamount to separating the chicken from the egg, and, as the popular riddle reminds us, very difficult to say what came first And speaking of corruption The scale of corruption in the Clinton camp, revealed by WikiLeaks in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, is simply astounding and should be enough to preclude any lectures on good behavior by the folks at Transparency International For starters, it was revealed in November that the Clinton Foundation received a $1 million gift from Qatar without telling the State Department, thereby breaking an agreement requiring it to reveal all foreign donations The check was reportedly a gift to former President Bill Clinton in 2011 for his 65h birthday A meeting was to take place between him and Qatari officials at some point, according to an email published last month, but it is not clear if this ever happened Clinton foundation admits receiving $1mn donation from Qatar that it previously hidhttps:// tdotco /sxyqgUB5fx At the same time, it was also established that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were not only donating heavily to the Clinton Foundation but were also arming andfundingthe militants of Islamic State Now if that isn t the worst case of political corruption then I don t know what is It is, therefore, no coincidence that populist politicians, simply responding to the market demand for fresh leadership, appeared around the world at just about the same time The fact that France has its own version of Donald Trump in the form of Marine Le Pen would only come as a surprise to those people who don t follow world events, or who are not told the truth about them Now that so many Western politicians and their affiliated parties are facing the threat of eviction this year (The most influential EU member states are witnessing a fierce struggle in the ranks amid the spectacular rise of anti establishment, far right politicians, likeLe Penin France,Geert Wildersin Holland andFrauke Petryin Germany), it is somewhat ironic that Transparency International would release a report warning voters that they are about to be hoodwinked by rabble rousing, right wing demagogues But there is a simpler explanation for the one sided nature of this report, and it is due to a massive conflict of interest on the part of its sponsors George#Soroslashes out at#Trumpand his self contradictory ideashttps:// tdotco /BqQVJXzZCgpic twitter com/d1oc7QIBBZ If you were doing consumer research on a particular product, would you trust the manufacturer of that product to carry out the research, or would you prefer some independent body to handle the job? I think most people would agree that the most reliable, trustworthy method would be to commission some third party with no connections to the company to provide its consensus That would dramatically reduce the chances of inaccurate results due to something called self interest And therein lies the glaring problem not only with this report but with Transparency International as a watchdog group A brief perusal of itssupporter listshould remove any doubt as to why Transparency International is extremely wary about populist politicians rocking the European boat of power Aside from receiving from a number of foreign governments (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Estonia and Finland, to name a few), TI is sponsored by the some of the most dubious names in democracy today, brought to you by none other than investor and philanthropist George Soros himself George Soros world is falling apart and he blames everyone but himself (Op Edge)https:// tdotco /gMCYy221cBpic twitter com/U0kpTFFmkr The opensociety Institute (OSI) and opensociety Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) ranks just behind the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a soft power non profit sponsored by the US government, on the list of TI s supporters Clearly, this is the last organization one should trust for providing an objective look at the rise of new political parties across the world Indeed, George Soros himself has been largely responsible for the massive influx of refugees to the europeanunion , going so far as tooffer cashincentives to refugees who wish to make the long, dangerous journey from the Middle East to the European continent Never mind that none of these displaced peoples, who have every right to our sympathy, will live in the same neighborhood as Mr Soros, who can well afford all the personal protection that is certainly desirable when embracing such reckless policies But for the average European citizen, who must accommodate these millions of new people who do not share the same religious, social and cultural predilections, nor in many cases the same high level of education, this social experiment carried out on the whim of a billionaire is the epitome of reckless behavior In fact, it should come as no surprise that the TI report singled out Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban Just this month, Szilard Nemeth, a vice president of the ruling Fidesz party,saidit would use ‚Äúall the tools at its disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúsweep out‚Äù NGOs funded by the Hungarian born financier, which ‚Äúserve global capitalists and back political correctness over national governments ‚Äù But all that pales in comparison to an award that Transparency International bestowed upon none other than former US Secretary of State HillaryClintonin 2012 for her emphasis on the importance of increasing transparency and countering corruption as part of US foreign policy, with the award addressed solely to those contributions Needless to say, that award drew a lot of raised eyebrows around the world There is a breathtaking degree of conflict of interest in this TI report, which, like so many closed halls of power in the EU today, is just begging for the transparent light of day The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV Novosti‚Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/375658-populist-soros-transparency-international-corruption/

"30 Jan, 2017",Soros-funded NGOs aiming to bring down our govt ‚Äì Hungarian Foreign Minister,"Hungary has had enough The nation s government has declared a battle against organizations funded by George Soros, calling for transparency within foreign backed NGOs operating in the country The move has already been condemned by Brussels, but Budapest has long refused to tow the EU line on refugees, ties with Russia, and other issues Can Hungary continue to put its own interests above those proclaimed to be common European interests? We ask Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijj rt√≥ Follow @SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:P√©ter Szijj rt√≥, Hungary s Foreign MInister, it s great to have you here on our program, welcome Peter Szijj rt√≥:My pleasure, thank you SS:So, we ll start with the latest: † Budapest has vowed to sweep out foreign NGOs funded by American billionaire George Soros † I know that he nowadays funds more than 60 groups like that How dangerous are those organisations for your country? PS:Actually, there s a very unfair and unjust approach being spread, actually, which tries to say that it is really the NGOs which represent the people of a given country which is a very dangerous approach, because it s not true There have never been any elections taking place where NGOs would ve run, so there were no people voting for I want this NGO to represent me or I want that NGO to represent me People vote on politicians, on political parties So it s the Parliament and it is the government which represent the people of a given country, so, actually, we think that this approach, that this NGOs would represent the society is very dangerous number one Number two, you know, there s a very clear and fair demand towards politics to be transparent and I think that it s not only politics which should be transparent, but all organisation which have an impact on public affairs, on political or social issues, they must be transparent as well, because the people have a right to know whom these NGOs, whom these organisations actually represent So, that s why we want to say that if there are NGOs in the country which are financed by foreign citizens, by other countries, by other governments then it should be known to the people SS:Who are these local groups? You must have some knowledge to be so worried and to close them down Who do they represent? Because Soros says he will continue working with local groups despite government s opposition PS:What we say is that they have to be transparent People have to know that if there are NGOs which would like to influence their opinion, their approach, their understanding towards politics then these people have to know, whom these are representing That s what we want to know SS:Well, who are they? PS:We do know that George Soros finances a lot of organisations in Hungary He has a very clear, let s say, attempt or a very clear interest, because he has already announced it and spoke about this very openly, that he would like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn t like our approach, doesn t like our policies But, it s not George Soros who has to make that decision, what government leads Hungary, it s the Hungarian people We find it very anti democratic, if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for SS:But when George Soros says that more than ever he s going to cooperate with small groups, that in a way means that he s going to go against the government s will How s that going to play out? PS:He has a very clear intention, that s definitely true, but I think it s an obvious right of the country, obvious right of the government to protect the country from external influence This is what we have heard a lot from the U S , for the last months, that external influence is so dangerous, when another country would liek to influence political procedures of another country So, it s a good reason, if this is american position, it can be our position as well, that if factors people, persons, businessmen of another country would like to influence political procedures in other country, from that we have to protect ourselves SS:If you re saying you re going after NGOs, you can t just go after Soros funded NGOs, you ll probably will have to go after other NGOs, like Greenpeace as well Are you ready to do that? PS:My position is that we have to ensure level playing field So, double standards we don t like, and so, actually, there must not be of course a regulation to NGOs which are funded by George Soros, there must be a general regulation on NGOs which oblige to governmental organisations to be transparent and to unveil whom they are funded by Actually, it s I wouldn t say funny because it s too serious to say that, but the abbreviation NGO stands for Non Governmental Organisations, and in many cases it turns out that, maybe, letter N is not appropriate there, because many times, other governments or other organisations which are affiliated to other governments, actually fund this kind of organisations As George Soros had a very clear and tight cooperation with Democrats, with the Clinton family, and he clearly had a strong influence on U S foreign policy, he clearly had a strong influence on the policy of the Clinton family so, actually, I don t think that NGO is the right abbreviation in this regard, because I think considering it a Non governmental organisation is too much SS:So this is like a preventive measure more than anything, right? Because you feel like these organisations can really influence your country s foreign policy? PS:I mean, actually, these NGOs can, from externally, can influence internal life social, political life of our country, and if this is a case then we have to know who they are SS:But here s a tricky part, though, because Hungary s ruling party has also benefited from Soros funded NGOs, before they came to power so if it was okay to work with him them, what has changed since? PS:Many of us, many of current political leaders, or politicians, have had scholarships from Soros Foundation and with that many of us have studied abroad in the U S and in the UK But, I mean, giving scholarships to study abroad, see the world, get skills and experience and come back is not the same as funding NGOs who are working against the government, these are two totally different things SS:Incoming American President Donald Trump has been also a very vocal critic of Soros and his NGOs around the globe do you think with him in the office it s going to be easier for Hungary to get rid of these Soros foundation NGOs in your country? PS:What I can tell you is the following, that in the political relationship between the U S and Hungary during recent years, were at the deepest points There were very clear attempts from the U S to interfere in our internal issues Just to give you an example, I was given a two page paper from one of the high ranking officials of the State Department during my first visit to the U S as a foreign minister This two pager contained some measures which the U S government expected us to do in Hungary in order to make it possible to enhance the political relationship but, come on! I mean, it s too much, it s interference in our internal issues, because these papers were not about bilateral cooperation, these were, clearly, about internal issues: laws, regulations in Hungary Although our economic and defence military cooperation have been perfect, this political relationship was very bad So, now, we have hope that this political relationship will improve, and as our position regarding migration, our position regarding the role of foreign policy is pretty similar with Donald Trump, we have a good hope that this political relationship will improve SS:We re going to talk about U S Hungary relationship in just a bit Just to finish with Soros, Your party has said that NGOs funded by Soros are working to bring illegal migrants to Hungary how are they doing this? Why would Soros need so many immigrants in Hungary? PS:What I understand from my colleagues, since I don t supervise intelligence agencies, that there were organisations which helped illegal migrants to find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background for these organisations SS:What s the reasoning behind it? Why would he want all these illegal immigrants in Hungary? PS:Since I m not him, I cannot tell you about that, I just can tell you what I have heard SS:I spoke to Ex president of Czech republic Vaclav Klaus † and he actually says that EU elites want an influx of refugees, which is weird, because looking now, I mean the whole refugee problem is about to cost top politicians their seats in Europe Why are they still so supportive of this open door policy? What do you think? PS:I wouldn t speak about refugees, I would speak about migrants, because we are bordered with, from South, we are boarded with peaceful countries Croatia, Serbia, from where migrants have entered Hungary, like 400,000 people, in 2015 I mean, how can someone be considered a refugee in Hungary, who comes from Serbia or comes from Croatia to Hungary? I mean, there s no war in Croatia, no war in Serbia, so I think that these people might not be considered as refugees They might be considered as refugees in the neighboring country where they escape from if there s war there, but definitely not in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Macedonia So, why the EU carries out this open door policy? You should ask the high ranking officials in Brussels, but I know that this is a bad policy It s harming the EU, it s dangerous, because this policy of open borders undermines security and safety in Europe Currently, we are experiencing a threat of terror more serious than ever in Europe, 1 5 mn illegal migrants entered the territory of the EU we don t even know who they are! And our question was whether this fact gives the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe or not † but if you speak like this, you re going to be attacked immediately in the Western European media saying that you said that migration equals terrorism , which you ve never said But we say that, yes, this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of migrants gave the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists to Europe SS:I feel like Western countries could ve presented a counter argument for instance, if we take just your country, your police has arrested if I m correct a Belgian and a Frenchman, who were going to join ISIS, they weren t refugees, and the last terror attack in Budapest was also committed by a local guy, a hungarian guy So, they will tell you that terrorism is not necessarily a refugee or a migrant thing, it s a homegrown thing PS:It can be homegrown, but my question is that if there s a massive influx of 1 5 mn people without knowing who they are with opening green borders to them, saying please come on in , without controlling them does it give the opportunity for terrorist organisations to send their terrorists easily to Europe? Yes, it does, and actually, this whole migration crisis has made it very clear that old taboos and dogmas must be overcome So, so far, you better did not speak about unsuccessful patterns of immigration in European Union, in Western Europe but now, it turned out that, yes, there have been double societies or parallel societies constructed, there are problems with integration of former migrants into Western European societies We have to speak about this openly We think that this solution based on quotas is totally unimplementable, it s totally against common sense We have to be able to protect ourselves We have to be able to make a decision whom we let to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not let that SS:So let s talk about the mandatory quotas that Hungary refuses to obey Luxembourg s Foreign Minister actually even said that you should be excluded from the EU for that Aren t you worried at all that this may lead to that if you disobey Brussels? PS:No, of course, because the decision about obligatory or mandatory quotas is breaking European regulations, because a mandatory quota system means the amendment of the Dublin treaty and the Dublin treaty cannot be amended by a majority decision of the Ministers of the Interior If you would like to change the treaties, then you have to go through a very complicated process with national ratifications, Parliament ratifications at the very end So this decision about mandatory quotas is unimplementable because, just put into consideration Hungary we are a Schengen member state, so if there s a decision that a number of ex migrants have to be settled in Hungary, then the next day they can leave Hungary towards Slovakia or Austria without any problem, because we are a Schengen zone country number one Number two it s against common sense, because an obligatory quota is kind of an encouragement, an invitation to people to Europe, because they re going to be redistributed instead of stopping the influx And, number three, it s breaking European regulations These three reasons are enough for us to go the European court to challenge this ruling SS:Just because this open door policy is so widely saluted by the Western states, when your PM, Mr Orban, comes out and says bringing in migrants to my country equals to national suicide I m thinking, maybe, it s a little bit of a stretch, because, I mean, mandatory quotas if you obey them, would only, maybe, bring like what, 1300 migrants to your country? I mean, your country has 10 mn people, is it really like a national suicide ? PS:There are tricks in that First, it was said in Brussels that, OK, there will be a quotas system, but voluntary Then it was said, OK, quotas system is now not voluntary, but mandatory Then it was said, OK, it will be a mandatory quota of about a 120 thousand Then it was said, yeah, mandatory quota is 160 thousand and then, financial penalty to those who don t oblige So, † these are tricks, and it s very clear and obvious that the Western European political elites, that Brussels, the institutions want more and more people to come, want an unlimited illegal migration to the EU, for which mandatory quotas would be the gate opener, and we just simply don t want it SS:You ve turned into one of the main transit hubs for hundreds of thousands of migrants and your country was criticised for putting up fences, but you weren t the only one there are Austria, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark, we have Belgium, who also introduced controls Is this the only way, to put up fences? PS:We are a member of the Schengen zone, which means that there s a free movement inside the Schengen zone, if you cross the borders according to regulation But, in order to be able to preserve that, you have to protect yourself externally So when you join the Schengen zone, then you sign up for some obligations We have an external border, and the Schengen code says that if you re located at the external border, you have to make sure that your border is only crossed through the official border crossing points, during opening hours it even said, during opening hours ! So, we have more than 500 km of land border, mainly flat, towards Croatia, towards Serbia so no Schengen member states There s no other possibility than some physical obstacle to comply with the Schengen regulations You know, when this whole crisis broke out, we posed the question in Brussels, whether this extraordinary situation gives us the excuse not to comply with Schengen regulations, and they said No, no, you have to comply with all of the regulations! then we put up the fence, to comply with the regulations, and then we were accused very badly So, it s tragic, I ll say SS:Are you pro Schengen or against Schengen? Because after tragic string of terrorist attacks in Europe, After the Berlin Christmas attacker was shot in Italy, countries like Italy or France started talking about maybe going back to former European borders, because desperate times call for desperate measures What do you think should be done? Should you go back to former European borders? PS:We are pretty much interested in preserving the Schengen zone, because if the Schengen zone collapses, then it s a suicide for the European economy European industry is mainly based on methodology of adjusting sequence and adjusting type production, which means that we need the free movement for goods and products If you cannot insure that, then the whole European economy will suffer huge losses So, our interest is to keep Schengen zone, but in order to be able to keep Schengen, to maintain Schengen zone, we have to strengthen the external protection of the Schengen zone That s what we have been working on, and that s why we don t like this kind of double standards, you know, that many times you re accused of protecting the external border and on the other hand, saying that the Schengen zone might die because there are too many people coming SS:You also said that by protecting its borders Hungary is protecting Europe, Europe s security, especially Germany is your country getting any help from the EU, being at the forefront of the all of this? PS:Very minimum The only serious support we received from our Central European friends, so it was about sealing of our green border you know, because many times it is said that we close our borders, it s not true, because we have border crossing ports where you can enter the territory of the country † of course, respecting the regulations When sealed off the green border, there were only three countries Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have helped us with technical assistance and human resources, manpower Only three countries SS:Your government wants to take it an extra stretch further and wants to limit the freedom of movement of those migrants who are already in Hungary PM Orban has come out and said that he understands that this really goes against all European , but he s still willing to take the risk How will the EU retaliate if Hungary does go against rules? PS:There s a very heavy contradiction in European Union, because Dublin treaty says that if you enter the territory of the European Union illegally and if you submit request for asylum, you have to stay on the territory of that given country, wait until your procedure is over, and the decision is made whether you get asylum status or not So, these people, who enter territory of Hungary, submitted asylum requests, and they left immediately Because of European regulations † you cannot keep them, but on the other hand, the European Union obliges you to comply with the Dublin treaty, which says that they have to stay on the soil of your country, but I mean, if you cannot make any kind of measures in order to keep them there, then how to comply with the European regulations? So, from our † perspective, this was the reasoning for this proposal SS:I want to talk a bit about the new President of America, Donald Trump EU officials reacted adversely to his election, however, your PM was very enthusiastic about him being the new President and even got an invitation to visit Washington do you think Orban s friendship with Trump will further complicate Hungary s relations with the EU? PS:I don t think that, because you will see that all European politicians are looking for friendship with Donald Trump, of course, because whether they like it or not, he s the President of the U S , and I see that there s a huge frustration within the Western European and liberal American political elite, that it turned out very clearly that it s not them, it s not liberal Western media, it s not liberal Western political elites, but the American citizens who make a decision who s going to be the President of the U S I can tell you that if a Democrat, if a Liberal president said the same things as Donald Trump has said, then the whole European media would celebrate him as such a progressive, such a † wonderful, such a smart guy !, but because it s Donald Trump, now he s bashed in every sentence, which I don t think would be fair and correct Yeah, we were enthusiastic, we were happy with him winning, although it had nothing to do with us, because it s American citizens, and we would have respected that decision anyhow but, of course, we were happy with his election victory because of two main issues, that regarding migration and foreign policy we represent position pretty similar † to his position SS:And elections are coming up also in France, Germany, in the Netherlands and I mean, everyone sees this shift to the right, and even though the people that are anti establishment forces, may not win this elections do you feel like Europe will continue business as usual, or this new political forces have the power to change the EU from within? PS:There s a very serious debate going on, within the EU, about the future of the EU, and it s no wonder these are challenging times There s a kind of fight or debate between two camps sovereignists and federalists We say we belong to the sovereignists, of course that European Union can only be strong if the member states are strong, and there should be no more authority brought to the level of Brussels If there are more and more governments saying this, then, of course, it will come to a change within the EU All of us, all 28, agree that we want strong European Union The only question is how to get there? Our position is that only strong member states can lead to a strong European Union SS:My last question is regarding the Russian sanctions the unity of the EU has been tested by the issue of Russian sanctions, and there are countries, like Hungary, Austria, Greece, Italy they don t want the sanctions, but they were obliged to support their European partners on that Do you feel like maybe, with the changing political climate in Europe and the U S , these sanctions will come to an end? Because they are harming Europe PS:We were always very clear that were unhappy with the sanctions, because we see no forward progress regarding Minsk agreements, because of sanctions We see many damages caused to European economies, including Hungarian economy So, I think, sanctions have been proven unsuccessful, although we never used our veto right because we didn t want to break the European unity but I really do hope that in the future, at least, there will be a possibility to re evaluate the sanctions, to have a highest possible level of discussion about the impacts of the sanctions So far, it was not given, unfortunately, and I really do hope that there will be a more pragmatic, more rational cooperation between U S and Russia, there will be more strategic cooperation between these two countries, and if this is the case, then I really do hope that the European approach will change as well SS:Foreign Minister, thank you very much, for this interview Good luck with everything PS:Thank you RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/375561-hungary-soros-eu-refugees/

"25 Jan, 2017",RT critics admit promotion of Russian media threat is a money racket,"Regular readers of RT Editorial will know this column has provided evidence of how think tanks, which are increasingly indivisible from lobby groups, faithfully promote the specific agendas of their paymasters regardless of their stated high minded missions When it comes to Russia, most of these faux academic concerns have primarily concerned themselves with whipping up hysteria about a supposed imminent military danger to Eastern Europe Shocker: almost all of them arefundedby weapon manufacturers and entities like the US Department of Defense In other words, the very people who need a bogeyman to justify heightened armed forces spending However, convincing the general public that Moscow is going to overrun Europe has always been a hard sell Mainly because Russia is not the USSR and its military spending is much smaller compared to NATO For example, the Kremlin s 2017defense budgetis around $45 billion This compares to the $622 billion Washington hasprojectedfor the coming year That does not include all the other NATO members, such as the United Kingdom, which recentlysigneda $125 billion contract with General Atomics, just for the supply of drones Probably aware they needed a new schtick, in recent years, bodies like The Atlantic Council and the Center For European Policy Analysis have expanded messaging about the supposed Russian threat to the long reigning mainstream media consensus RT is, of course, the favorite target and scary monster As a result, we see a kind of schizophrenic discourse where the network oscillates from being a huge danger to something nobody watches (but still is a cause for a cash call), depending on which agenda they are pushing on a given day With this in mind, it was interesting to note Monday s Guardianpiece, headlined EU escalates its campaign against Russian propaganda, ù for two reasons Firstly, because the newspaper apparently couldn t think of an example of Russian propaganda ùin an article about Russian propaganda ùand instead used a story promoted by an American website, to illustrate the purported Russian threat: In recent weeks the unit (Stratcom East, an EU outfit dedicated to watching Russian news services) has been correcting a widely shared and entirely false story that claimed that a 1,000 strong mob chanting Allahu Akbar ù burned down Germany s oldest church, ùthey wrote This storyappearedon Breitbart, which is based in Los Angeles and is 100 percent American owned Then they followed up, with EU officials estimate that Russia spends $1bn ( 801m) on state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik ùQuite why the EU needs to guess is beyond rational understanding, given how RT is transparent about its financing, which amounts to around $300 million this year, or less than a third of that appraisal Not just that, but all media funding by the Russian state is widely publicized every year, and even adding up the RT and Sputnik budgets still amount to much less than half of the reported figure So much for the MSM s war on fake news ù Just as the EU increased the strength of its Stratcom East ù annex from eleven staff to 19, and lobbed another 800,000 in its direction (because nearly $800 million for BBG and 289 million supplementary Defense & Security funding for BBC World Service clearly weren t enough, not to mention the financial support for the likes of DW, France24, and Euronews to continue fighting the good fight), came a most enlightening conversation between a group of media experts, specializing in the post Soviet space The event washostedby n ost, a German advocacy group, funded by Washington s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which has earned a bit of a reputation forpromoting regime change ùin countries independent of US foreign policy The chat concerned whether articles about Russian propaganda now are more widely read than Russian propaganda itself ùRight now, you can take Russian propaganda ùto mean anything which offers an alternative view to the mainstream media consensus At the roundtable were an interesting bunch of folk Alexey Kovalev, formerly of RIA Novosti, was joined by Vladimir Soloviev of Moldova s Newsmaker, which gets its cash from the European Endowment For Democracy (the EU s version of NED) and Gemma P√∂rzgen, a board member of Reporters Without Borders, a concern funded by George Soros, NED and the EU Commission As they spoke, our heroes seemed to realize how ridiculous the whole hysteria against Russian media has become P√∂rzgen admitted that in the case of Germany, for example, I think the problem is grossly exaggerated Some so called experts have blown it up out of all proportion There s a lack of proper research on the subject that could provide an objective view There s a lot of propaganda around propaganda if you see what I mean ùMeanwhile, Kovalev conceded that (in Russia) state TV channel budgets, both domestic and international, are being cut, projects are being wound down and so on ù It was toward the end of the discussion when things got fascinating when in this warm, relaxed echo chamber atmosphere the brave info warriors let it slip that their entire mission is essentially a money racket Take Kovalev: the battle with Russian propaganda ù has already turned into a fully fledged industry in which many people, including myself, have had successful careers It would be stupid to give them up because of the negligibility of our field of study That s one reason ù Soloviev: I also see it as an industry, with budgets that need to be spent In Moldova, the subject is a best seller on the internal political market In 2015 the current Mayor of Chisinau (and deputy chair of the right wing Liberal Party) won his third election thanks to the fact that he spent most of his election campaign fighting Russian tanks But there s nothing new about the city looking like the site of some kind of urban warfare ù P√∂rzgen: You re right there, Alexey There are so many people in the market who used to cover security issues and have now lost their jobs But now they ve seen the chance to get back into business There are also lobbying groups such as the Atlantic Council, who have started running conferences all over Europe on the same subject: The rising influence of Russian propaganda ù And with that, you could have dropped the metaphorical mic Because the same people who benefit, via funding for their projects, from stoking the fears of Russian domination of the

"7 Jan, 2017",George Soros‚Äô world is falling apart ‚Äì and he blames everyone but himself,"George Soros, the Hungarian born billionaire who has meddled in politics across Europe and North America for decades, is angry The world he campaigned for is falling apart, and now he s busy looking for leaders to indict Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv According toSoros, liberal democracy is failing all across the western world Apparently, this is because what he calls the opensociety ù is in crisis Now, he may very well be right about this, but pinning it on Angela Merkel seems somewhat bizarre Especially when she is painted as being inadvertently in league with Vladimir Putin But, nevertheless, it s the German chancellor he regards as most culpable for why voters have become disenchanted with modern democracy Writing in a widely published New Year op ed, Soros traces the current European crisis back to the crash of 2008 He laments how Germany emerged as the hegemonic power in Europe, but it failed to live up to the obligations that successful hegemons must fulfill, namely looking beyond their narrow self interest to the interests of the people who depend on them ù Then he harks back to the 1940 s Compare the behavior of the US after WWII with Germany s behavior after the Crash of 2008, ù he observes The US launched the Marshall Plan, which led to the development of the EU; Germany imposed an austerity program that served its narrow self interest ù Russophrenia: Western elites ignore their own citizens anger and blame Russia instead (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /h5UohS2ceE This is very unfair to Berlin The difference here is that the Marshall Plan followed the most destructive war humanity has ever known, and the US was not practicing pure benevolence either It was acting in naked self interest, because it feared all of Europe turning communist And despite Marxist Moscow helping to win the conflict, it was abundantly clear that the USSR and the US would compete for global domination in the new world order of the time Thus, the US was creating a buffer zone against the Soviets and bolstering allies it would need for its own protection, and for the maintenance of the capitalist system it promoted Germany s situation in 2008 was rather different Berlin was not seeking to become a global superpower, and the public was not pushing for it either Also, there was no ideology in play, other than a belief that countries should live within their means Furthermore, Germany had recently completed a costly reunification, and its economy was only returning to growth after a decade of near stagnation For the average German in 2008, the last thing on their mind was becoming Europe s hegemonic power Soros attack on Germany is probably borne out of personal frustration over Merkel s lack of willingness to push for further European integration Yet, this policy is merely a reflection of what her electorate wants Miserly Germans are unable to countenance financially supporting profligate southern Europeans As a result, the Euro currency project, which Merkel s predecessor Helmut Kohl was basically forced into by France, has always had a questionable long term future Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants #GeorgeSoros(Op Ed by Sam Gerrans)https:// tdotco /Kgqh4ICNxGpic twitter com/3HC9l5tljI If we believe Soros back story (and many have questioned it), he pushes liberal democracy for perfectly valid reasons The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler s Germany in 1944, ù he writes Later, of course, this regime was replaced with a totalitarian communist system before he fled Budapest in 1947 In his op ed, Soros tells us that his experiences in Britain and the United States taught him how open societies ù are the only ones which guarantee the safety of their people Indeed, the Hungarian may be right about this However, where he has long failed is in understanding the reasons why some countries are not ready for the kind of liberalism he espouses Let s remember how hechuckedmillions of dollars into pro western movements inUkraine A man born and raised in neighboring Hungary should have been well aware of how divided the country was, and known that his actions could lead to turmoil Especially given that his homeland has a stake in the southwestern part, where Hungarian is often the spoken language Yet, he ploughed ahead, and his actions helped to destroy the country The billionaire now says the only explanation I can find (for the electorate s rejection of globalization/liberalism) is that elected leaders failed to meet voters legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy ù Yes, this is really George Soros writing The same George Soros who attends Davos every year Because, if you were looking for a symbol of where the elites and the plebs most diverge, it would probably be at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain commune Where the rulers of the world look down on us mere mortals from the highest town in Europe (at 1,560 meters) Davos is the problem, not the solution (Op Edge by@NeilClark66)https:// tdotco /bwKAWPhSx5pic twitter com/49L7oGSMKq But Soros then decides to pin a large part of the blame on a figure who has never been much of a cheerleader for Davos Merkel And he goes on to predict the demise of the EU itself With economic growth lagging and the refugee crisis out of control, the EU is on the verge of breakdown and is set to undergo an experience similar to that of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s ù The reason for the EU s impending doom is apparently the 2017 election cycle, where the contests in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France will be key In the latter, the two leading contenders [Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon] are close to Putin and eager to appease him, ù according to Soros French people sacrifice their own interests to help Putin win the world? (Op Edge by@27khv)https:// tdotco /qctrsI5Dtn So, now we are finally on to Putin Soros feels that if either Le Pen or Fillon wins, Putin s dominance of Europe will become a fait accompli ù He writes: I am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of opensociety ù This is because Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about ù Put plainly, the notion that Putin somehow engineered the French election to organize a contest between Fillon and Le Pen (which is still not guaranteed) is preposterous But this is the trauma filled world Soros now inhabits And he goes on to make another ridiculous statement: In a brilliant move, he [Putin] exploited social media companies business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies That is how he helped Trump get elected ù In other words, Soros thinks Putin manipulated Facebook and Twitter to win the US election for Trump This argument is ridiculous and makes Soros look stupid It also suggests that he s throwing his rattle out of the pram because a few democratic decisions have gone against him And he needs to denigrate Merkel and use Putin as a bogeyman in order to deflect any mud from himself But lets look at the reality here Soros strongly opposed George W Bush s presidency He funded the Move On project and threwmillionsuponmillionsat the democraticparty What this interference did was help remove them from their working class base and transform them into a globalist party, which now seems to win only in coastal metropolitan areas Shorn of a need to fund raise to the same extent as before, leftists used Soros money to focus on identity politics , which alienates the white working class And that same blue collar group voted overwhelmingly for Trump this fall For his own part, Soros, ironically at Davos,predictedthat Trump had no chance of being elected president And he was wrong Now it appears he can t deal with the outcome Perhaps because he feels his life s work is slipping away The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/372921-soros-eu-democracy-putin-merkel/

"31 Dec, 2016","The good, the bad & the ugly: Remembering the events that rocked 2016","The year 2016 will go down in history as a period when the world looked perched on the edge: US Russia relations hit rock bottom, the US hosted its most tumultuous presidential election in years, all the while NATO continued its eastward march to Russia If there were a hero of the year list for 2016, Russian soldierAleksandr Prochorenkowould certainly be counted among the top contenders Prochorenko, 25, was assigned the dangerous task of identifying the coordinates of ISIS targets in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for Russian led airstrikes One day while on duty, his location was uncovered by ISIS terrorists When they began closing in on him, he did what many people in a similar situation would have found unthinkable: Rather than allowing himself to be captured, Aleksandr called in an airstrike on himself a decision that also took out the approaching enemy John Wight captured the essence of Prochorenko s single act of heroism when he wrote: I don t know Aleksandr Prochorenko I know nothing of his background or what his dreams and hopes were for the future But I do know that he s a hero who will never be forgotten, and that the cause for which he sacrificed his life is a righteous one Prochorenko will forever symbolize the courage of those who stood in defiance of the most barbaric and inhuman ideology the world has seen since the aforementioned Waffen SS were rampaging across the Soviet Union, murdering and slaughtering every living thing in their path in service to fascism –£ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥ –ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–æ–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å –Ω–∞ —Å–µ —è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞https:// tdotco /vBlfP1vN9Upic twitter com/tvuM6Qsnfs At the same time that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was attempting toconvincethe world that NATO does not seek confrontation, and that it is everyone s interest to avoid a new arms race, the Western military bloc enlisted a new member, Montenegro, while pushing its game pieces ever closer to Russia s borders However, as Pepe Escobarexplained, The real measure ù is thedeploymentof the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week plus a further one in Poland in 2018 This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s Putin emphasized that NATO s inexorable slide eastward will eventually cause Moscow to respond adequately to any threat to its national interests On an entirely different note, yet no less jarring, the world watched as the annual Eurovision music contest, representing the countries of Europe, fell victim to political intrigue In clear violation of the European Broadcasting Union s No Politics rules, the Ukrainian contestant, Jamala (Susana Jamaladynova), took first place with a song that was about the deportation of her Tatar family in Crimea at the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin Stalin suspected the Tatars of supported German forces during World War II Needless to say, the topic broached Eurovision s rules Neil Clark, looking at the geopolitical situation behind this cultural event,providedhis thoughts on why the Establishment allowed a politically charged song against Russia to take top honors: The prospect of a Russian Eurovision win and next year s contest being held in Moscow certainly seems to have caused great panic in Western Establishment circles We ve already got the next football World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia in 2018 an event which has come under attack from Russophobes who are calling for boycotts or for the tournament to be transferred; having Eurovision in Russia as well would clearly be too much for them For daring to resist Western regime change plans in Syria and elsewhere, Russia should be sanctioned and isolated and not be hosting international events watched by millions of people around the world!, Clark concluded via GIPHY As if the United States and Europe were in some sort of race to the bottom of the cultural cesspool, it was reported that Satan worship was on the rise in the country whose righteous motto is, In God We Trust Iben Thranholmtackledthis devilish phenomenon now sweeping the United States, which is being undertaken by a group that styles itself as The Satanic Temple (TST) Founded in 2013, the group fights for political change by pointing out the ostensibly preferential treatment Christianity enjoys in politics, Thranholm wrote TST has seven chapters in the USA and Europe, and claims a membership of 100,000 One of the group s objectives is to embed Lucifer in the public school system by establishing afternoon clubs, adoringly dubbed After School Satan ù Currently nine clubs are listed under the program, including in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Washington DC The clubs will focus on rationalism, free inquiry and fun ù,according to a promotional video Thranholm cited some disturbing figures from God Country : Seventy percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 with no religious affiliation say religion is not important in their lives A similar share also report they seldom or never pray and 42 percent say they do not believe in God Is it time for America to update its lofty motto? While the US led countries continued with their regime change operations around the Middle East and North Africa, 2016 was the year when the proverbial chickens came home to roost in the form of millions of displaced refugees from † war torn countries, like Iraq, Libya and Syria Although this influx of desperate people, anxious to start up a normal life once again, would severely challenge Europe s welfare system at a time of economic hardship, the philanthropist George Soros believed it was time to welcome the migrants with open arms In September, hepublisheda letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants, that begins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù Not everybody, however, believes that George Soros plan will reap positive benefits via GIPHY Sam Gerrans took Soros to task for his efforts, arguing that the forced migration caused by Western wars would destroy European civilization as we know it: If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states, Gerrans concluded The question is one that is now dividing Europe in more ways than one: Should Europe welcome these migrants, or close their doors to them despite the fact that Europe cooperated in the illicit regime change operations that triggered this great migration in the first place? Just as everything was looking bright and rosy for the global economy, a more somber if not outright disastrous outlook was being tossed about by some of the more respected names in finance Following news that Germany s Deutsche Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the US on settling a massive fine stemming from alleged mortgage fraud during the 2008 financial crisis, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, sounded the alarm on the future trajectory of the economy Asked what would transpire if Deutsche Bank would go belly up, Rogersresponded: Then the EU would disintegrate, because Germany would no longer be able to support it, would not want to support it A lot of other people would start bailing out; many banks in Europe have problems And if Deutsche Bank has to fail that is the end of it In 1931, when one of the largest banks in Europe failed, it led to the Great Depression and eventually the WWII His prediction caused a lot of people to sit up and take notice The year 2016 will also be remembered as a time of marked hostility where one would least expect to find it: The world of sports, where good gamesmanship once held reign No more In a highly controversial move, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) had recommended a blanket ban for all Russian athletes from the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 over alleged doping Critics cried foul, saying Russian athletes had been unfairly targeted In any case, 271 out of 389 Russian athletes were eventually allowed to compete This is where good manners took a back seat to raw nastiness During the women s 100m breaststroke final, 19 year old American Lilly King took gold, while Russia s Yulia Efimova took the silver However, in terms of good sportsmanship and international decorum, King fell flat As Finian Cunninghamexplained:King s boorish victory splashing of water into her Russian rival s face was later followed by a blunt refusal to shake Efimova s hand during the subsequent medal ceremony Let s deal with some facts here, Cunningham continued Efimova is based in the US where she has been training for several years So much then for claims of Russian state sponsored doping ù Efimova, like other athletes, may have unknowingly ingested food supplements that contained prohibited substances Efimova was tested positive for the heart medication Meldonium The problem arose after Meldonium was put on the proscribed list as a performance enhancing drug only in January of this year In an interesting turn of events, a group of hacktivists laterreleasedfiles claiming that top US athletes received approval from WADA to take banned substances The US anti doping agency, sports federations and athletes themselves rejected the claims As 2016 headed into its final lap, tragedy struck as Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, wasgunned downas he addressed an audience during an art exhibition in the capital Ankara Although most of the media commentary on this heinous act was sympathetic, a couple deranged pieces regarding the assassination managed to surface, which did far more than just add insult to injury As Bryan MacDonaldexplained: Following the appalling murder of Russia s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov two particular individuals have penned diatribes so lacking in basic humanity that it s fair to question their sanity, let alone decency The reader will be able to discern the line of reasoning in one of the articles, written by Gersh Kuntzman from New York s Daily News, from the astonishing headline alone: Assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was not terrorism, but retribution for Vladimir Putin s war crimes ù In another article, Brian Whitmore of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty attempted to somehow rationalize Karlov s murder: Intervening in the Middle East is never, ever without costs, Whitmore tells us So yes, the assassination of Andrey Karlov was a tragedy and a crime It could also turn out to be a harbinger ù As MacDonald argues, such reckless journalism places all diplomats in danger as fair game for assassination For instance, by this logic, if the US ambassador to Afghanistan or Iraq were shot, the Daily News is basically telling us that it can be justified as a response to American aggression against those countries In December, in the aftermath of Donald Trump s landslide victory over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, it began to look as if Clinton was angling to take the White House through some back door machinations Things began to look less than 100 percent for The Donald as Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, petitioned for arecount of votesin Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania The idea didn t seem so wild at the time for a Clinton coup as the mainstream media was perpetually repeating the footnote that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306 232), he failed to win the popular vote reportedly by 2 5 million votes Robert Bridge considered the possibility that Clinton in similar fashion to George W Bush in the 2000 election when he won the presidency against Al Gore thanks to the intervention of the Supreme Court could steal the White House from Trump This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes, Bridgewrote In fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility and a very high one in this particular battle of so called faithless electors tipping this contest in Clinton s favor Despite feverish speculation in the media that the Electoral College would vote against the will of their constituents in favor of Clinton an unlikely yet possible scenario Trump went on to formally secure the vote and the presidency on December 19 via GIPHY As Western leaders became fixated with blaming everything from Brexit to EU forced migration to fixing the US presidential election on Russia in general and Vladimir Putin in particular, the best response to the insanity came in the form of political satire Danielle Ryan proved that the best way torespondto fake news on such a level is with a healthy dose of humor: Shocking revelations earlier this week as US intelligence officials confirmed with high confidence ù that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved ù in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee According to the anonymous sources inside the anonymous US intelligence agency, Putin s objectives were multifaceted, but the whole thing began as a vendetta ù against Hillary Clinton because she said some mean things about him a few times The high level, anonymous and completely trustworthy sources also told a major US news agency that Putin himself had piloted a specially designed Russian spy plane across the Atlantic to personally direct the still ongoing hacking operations from the air Goodbye 2016! For many, the year 2016 can not make its departure soon enough It was a year marked by tragedy, war and worsening bilateral relations between two nuclear superpowers On the upside, 2016 also witnessed the cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the embattled city of Aleppocelebratedits first Christmas since the start of the war Hopefully this positive, uplifting trend will carry into 2017 and the world will enter an extended period of peace Happy New Year!

the local level through civilsociety advocacy, monitoring, and civic activism, ùreads a US State Department funding announcement, published this week on thegrants govwebsite It explains further that the State Department is looking for civilsociety organizations, ùeither non profit or for profit (with some conditions) that will provide proposals to perform a watchdog function and advocate for democratic governance ùin Ukraine The description states the program is aimed at increasing civic activism in Ukraine at a local level and building and training a network of civic activists throughout the country These in turn are to keep watch on the activities of local governments and encourage partnerships between civilsociety and media to communicate important information about local reforms to the public ù The organizations applying for the grant must present a program for their activities, along with a financial plan, by January 17, 2017 They are also required to have ties with thematic or in country partners, entities and relevant stakeholders, including private sector partners and NGOs ùand provide proof of these links or their potential development The description states that

in the implementation of the program that receives the grant It will, for instance, demand quarterly reports on the program s spending and progress Experts believe that this and other such funding opportunities Washington has offered Ukraine are a means of preventing the fall of the country s president and Washington favorite, Petro Poroshenko The Ukrainian leader s public approval ratings have plunged recently According toLiga Net, in November Poroshenko s rating drew 14 3 percent of popular support having plummeted to a low of 10 7 percent in summer He is still behind former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the ratings Speakingto RT Russian, political analyst Nikolay Shlyamin said: The activists who will work in the country under this program and for the money from this grant will penetrate [Ukraine s] state agencies to monitor the spending of officials and then publish reports on the expenditures from the state budget In addition, they will attract the media who will cover the process of fighting against corruption in the country In this case, there is a chance that the Americans will be able to keep their favorite at the helm for the upcoming presidential elections, ù Shlyamin believes He notes that the Ukrainian people have become disillusioned with Poroshenko s leadership, with his promises to introduce visa free travel with the EU and eradicate corruption proving a failure Under Poroshenko, Ukraine has so far been unable to secure europeanunion and NATO membership In domestic policy [there have been] also continuous failures, ùShlyamin told RT Russian He believes the current grant is one of the final efforts by US President Barack Obama s administration to maintain US Ukraine relations as they have been since the coup in 2014 Obama will soon leave office Therefore, he needs to have time to allocate the necessary financial resources to continue the current policy and prevent future president Donald Trump from building a new line of cooperation

"2 Oct, 2016",Soros to make a killing with European 'forced migration',"The philanthropist George Soros recently published a letter in the Wall Street Journal entitled, Why I m Investing 500 million USD in Migrants In this article, I will be looking at that letter and separating what it means from what it appears to say Soros letterbegins: The world has been unsettled by a surge in forced migration Tens of millions of people are on the move, fleeing their home countries in search of a better life abroad Some are escaping civil war or an oppressive regime; others are forced out by extreme poverty, lured by the possibility of economic advancement for themselves and their families ù This is quite true And Soros should know since histhink tankis fully on board with that forced migration ù He has either initiated it or facilitated it and, according to Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary (which is presently holding a referendum on whether to accept migrant quotas as demanded by the EU), asquotedby Bloomberg: His name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens nation states, they support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle [ ] These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human smuggling network ù Soros backed activists are at thecenterof that network Soros continues: Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability îboth in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù I have touched on Soros psychological peculiarities elsewhere; his narcissistic traits notwithstanding, I shall assume he is not using the royal we ù That granted, about whom is he speaking when he talks of Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies ù?If about governments, we should remember that he is elected to no nation s government, nor has he ever been That does not prevent him, however, from meddling in their internal affairs and supporting insurrections such as so called colorrevolution s, including inGeorgiaandUkraine, and whipping up chaos viaBLMin the US He also famouslyattackedthe British pound, making himself a billion dollars He wishes the reader to assume inclusion by his use of our ù But we are not included; we are simply being told what is to happen He then writes of the proven benefit that greater integration could bring ù This is almost a rhetorical conundrum; he and his lawyers expect not without reason that most people will provide their own color to what the words on the page say He claims proof but provides none and that is a major omission given that we are expected to entrust our entire cultural and economic future to his assertions Many countries, including Japan, China, UAE, Israel and Singapore, are extremely careful to whom they grant citizenship If the benefits Soros claims were proven, surely they would be on board, too EU has 900 no go areas because of migrants Hungaryhttps:// tdotco /qyCJ5lzUeTpic twitter com/CXjYw3cbRp To continue: Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees But harnessing the power of the private sector is also critical Recognizing this, the Obama administration recently launched a Call to Action ù asking U S companies to play a bigger role in meeting the challenges posed by forced migration Today, private sector leaders are assembling at the United Nations to make concrete commitments to help solve the problem ù Soros, naturally, does not blush at telling us what our governments must ùdo The term forced migration is clever mind hook You may be sure that it was worked on for hours and many alternatives discarded Its power lies in the fact that it implies both helplessness in the face of an unstoppable external force and inevitability of result while at the same time disregarding causes If anyone still cares, the causes include: attacks by the US and Nato on countries which have done them no harm; Angela Merkel sopen invitationto the third world to move to Europe; material and informationalsupportfrom Soros funded organizations Soros continues: In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities I will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world ù I will translate: Now that the inflow of immigrants has been set up, I am going to invest $500 million to make the process unstoppable, endless and self funding, and make a lot of money for myself at the same time And since this is dressed in the language of compassion, there is nothing you can say against it ù Back to Soros letter: This commitment of investment equity will complement the philanthropic contributions my foundations have made to address forced migration, a problem we have been working on globally for decades and to which we have dedicated significant financial resources ù Just remove the words philanthropic (which does not mean at the elite level what you think it means) and realize that address means facilitate to Soros, and you will understand this sentence correctly; this is a carefully crafted statement of policy He continues: We will seek investments in a variety of sectors, among them emerging digital technology, which seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non migrant communities This is why money now moves instantaneously from one mobile wallet to another, drivers find customers by using only a cellphone, and how a doctor in North America can see a patient in Africa in real time Customizing and extending these innovations to serve migrants will help improve the quality of life for millions around the world All of the investments we make will be owned by my nonprofit organization They are intended to be successful îbecause I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants îand any profits will go to fund programs at the opensociety Foundations, including programs that benefit migrants and refugees ù Thus, anyone who wishes to will be able to plug into the system you and your families have been paying into all your lives and access its main arteries with nothing more than a mobile phone Soros, meanwhile, makes a load more money which he can then plough into the very organizations which will make sure the inflow of migrants never stops Soros goes on to claim: As longtime champions of civilsociety , we will be focused on ensuring that our investments lead to products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities ù Leaving what Soros may mean by civilsociety , I turn to his use of benefit ; benefit according to whom? According to George Soros a man who destabilizes sovereign states as part of his modus operandi Soros concludes: We will also work closely with organizations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to establish principles to guide our investments Our goal is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission ù What this means in English is: The fix is in, and now all you smaller fish further down the food chain can make a nice buck off the gravy train of selling your countries out because if this weren t a sure thing, I wouldn t be in it ù This is cultural and ethnic cleansing in a business suit; it is the de facto usurpation of the nation state as a social construct for the peoples of Europe as part of a multi purpose war one designed to destroy oil rich states and any state with no central bank, while simultaneously collapsing sovereign states However, my point here is not the mass immigration although with the inevitable, eventual annihilation of the middle class in Soros host countries ùthere will be nowhere for genuine refugees to go; it is that we have taxation without even the fig leaf of representation so long as men like Soros can openly create and dictate policy @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/361376-george-soros-investing-forced-immigration/
"24 Aug, 2016","Modern Ukraine is 25 yrs old, but is it actually independent?","Ukraine celebrates the 25th anniversary of its succession from the Soviet Union this week But, after years of struggle and division is it truly independent? Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist based in Russia He has written for RT since 2014 Before moving to Russia, Bryan worked for The Irish Independent, the Evening Herald, Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv March 2014 was arguably the most dramatic and pivotal month in Kiev since Ukraine seceded from the USSR The country s democratically elected government had been overthrown in a violent coup (considered to be a revolution in the West) and the new regime was struggling for legitimacy Especially after a leaked phone callbetweenthe US Ambassador Geoff Pyatt, and State Department representative Victoria Nuland, seemed to suggest external actors had dictated its make up Adding to the tumult, Crimea had just voted to separate and re unite with Russia in a hastily organized referendum, (which is regarded as an annexation by much of the West) and Donbass witnessed clashes between pro Maidan protestors and others who opposed the movement At this moment, Ukraine was on fire and needed all the support it could muster Except that backing never came, despite gaggles of Western politicians showing up in Kiev in early 2014 pledging solidarity with activists who sought to remove President Yanukovich Two and a half years later, Ukraine has received minimal aid from Western countries and is no closer to EU membership than it was then In fact, even the promised visa free travel arrangement with Schengen countries has yet to materialize Sharp analysts have long suggested that Western power brokers aren t that dedicated to helping Ukraine Instead, the argument goes, the priority seems to be hurting Russia This week, via a DC Leaks dump of billionaire Hungarian investor George Soros communications; we havenew evidenceto support that argument What s also interesting is that when Russia ejected Soros NGOs, Western reaction was apoplectic DC Leaks revelationssuggestPresident Putin s move to block these groups might have been soundstrategy On the last day of March in 2014, according to the files, Ambassador Pyatt sat down for breakfast with billionaire Soros and a group of lobbyists he employs to push his agenda inEastern Europe What is most startling about the conversation is the total lack of regard for Ukrainian interests and the obsessive focus on Russia It s also instructive as to how Western influencers regard Ukraine More as a buffer against Moscow than as a country with rightful aspirations of its own At one stage Pyatt asks Soros, what (the) USG (US government) should be doing and what the USG is currently doing (sic)? ùThe reply is Obama has been too soft on Putin, ùand he goes on to suggest a division of labor between the US and the EU with the US playing the bad cop role ùin dealing with the Kremlin It s all Putin, Putin, Putin and continues in this vein The only mention of Ukraine is when Pyatt and Soros agree to remove Yulia Timoshenko from the equation Timoshenko is associated with everything undignified, ùthe ambassador states Now, we are all entitled to an opinion on Timoshenko But her political party Fatherland is currently themost popularin Ukraine and it s up to Ukrainians to decide whether she is fit for office, not a bunch of foreigners who have no democratic mandate in the country After all, Ukraine is supposed to be a sovereign state But a quarter of a century after modern Ukraine was established, how independent is it really? If we define it as the ability to conduct policy in the best interests of its own citizens, then we can t describe Ukraine as truly autonomous What we know is that the nation has lurched from crisis to crisis and that these events are usually presented in western media as battles between pro western reformers ùand pro Russian kleptocrats ùThis is hogwash The reality is that the country is split into two camps of oligarchs, one side based in Kiev and western regions (led by current President Poroshenko) and the other rooted in the east (previously controlled by one of Ukraine s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov) What happened after Maidan is that the former cabal replaced the latter in the corridors of power And for the past two years, they ve been busy stealing what they regard as the spoils of victory Something even America s influential Foreign Policy journal nowadmits There are few real differences between Poroshenko and Yanukovich But what springs to mind is that the current incumbent speaks better English and thus presents a warmer face to the West Furthermore, he s enthusiastic about NATO membership, whereas the former president preferred horse trading between east and west in search of the bestdeal That said, Poroshenko is described as pro Europe and his predecessor as pro Russia However, in reality, both men are pro themselves and pro money Since the Soviet collapse, the constituent republics have traveled different roads, with varying degrees of success The Baltics have seen a dramatic improvement in living standards, but hemorrhaged people to more prosperous western nations, putting their respective futures in doubt Meanwhile, Belarus ignored the USSR s implosion and continued down a similar path, sacrificing freedoms for social cohesion and reasonably good health, social welfare and education systems The central Asians with the exception of Kazakhstan have struggled and the Caucasus nations of Armenia and Georgia have largely stagnated The two outliers have been Ukraine and Moldova Both have obvious natural advantages, being close to EU markets and blessed with good climates They also inherited advanced infrastructure from the Soviet era Yet, the two countries are now worse off than they were 25 years ago Let s just look at Ukraine s figures In 2014, itseconomywas 30 percent smaller in real terms than in 1991 and the average citizen was 20 percent less well off After two years of recession, those numbers are surely worse now To add insult to injury, it is also the world s mostunequal country When you consider the USSR bequeathed a vast industrial base to Kiev, the situation is even more startling The country was once a world leader in aviation and machinery production and had one of the planet s most extensive rail systems A case in point highlights the level of mismanagement is the story of Antonov, which built the world s largest plane, the An 225 This year, Antonov was liquidated because the government forced it to sever its contract with Russia s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), purely for political reasons Twenty five years ago, Ukraine was on a par with Poland Today, it would need to grow by about 10 percent per annum until 2032, just to catch up with where its more successful neighbor is now With that in mind, you d expect NATO members to offer Ukraine a type of Marshall Plan to reboot its failed economy, but nothing has been forthcoming Because they know the funds would be stolen Armed with this knowledge, Western leaders are content to exploit Ukraine as a buffer against Russia As Barack Obama hasadmitted, Ukraine is a core interest for Moscow, in a way that it is not for the United States ùThus, by keeping Ukraine on a tight leash they can antagonize Russia, without needing to spend huge amounts of money For the current regime in Kiev, the definition of Ukrainian independence is to avoid any sort of relationship with Moscow As the scholar Nicolai Petrohas correctly noted, the root of Ukraine s economic collapse is the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with Russia, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor ù In little over a year, living standards in Ukraine have fallen by half, the value of the currency has slumped by more than two thirds, and inflation has skyrocketed to 43 percent Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal, ùPetro recently wrote However, one particular policy sums up the madness that has gripped Kiev You see, Ukraine doesn t want to be seen to be buying Russian gas so it refuses to purchase directly from Gazprom, instead obtaining its energy from Slovakia Except it s not Slovakia s gas, because that country doesn t have any of its own Now the funny part is that Bratislava imports 90 percent of its requirements from Russia and it then re sells the stuff it imports from Russia to Ukraine at a 30 percent premium Ukraine s completely insane economic suicide, explained in a few paragraphs pic twitter com/iCTxlbD4MA Therefore, Kiev is paying $130 for $100 gas because it doesn t want to admit that it s Russian gas This is proof of the mindset of Ukrainian policymakers Twenty five years after the USSR collapsed, Ukraine is worse off than it was under direct rule from Moscow To comfort themselves, the Kiev elite have staged an independence day ùmilitary parade this week, which is rather baffling when the act of separation was entirely peaceful, with no soldiers involved at all Aside from all this, what Poroshenko s regime can t explain is how independent Ukraine truly is Currently, it s financially beholden to the IMF, which can reduce its economy to rubble with a stroke of a pen and its leaders are apparently chosen by foreign officials and wealthy lobbyists with no connection to the country To make matters worse, Kiev has completely burned its bridges with Russia, which hosts the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world If Back to the Future s Marty McFly and the Doc turned up in a fleet of DeLoreans and offered Ukrainians a chance to return to 1991 and start again,

Patrick Henningsen:They do If you look back at the history of the europeanunion , the United States in a sort of covert fashion initially anyway, post WWII was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the europeanunion And that has been learned through declassified documents and those are now publicly available It is easier for the US to wield its foreign policy agenda by dealing with one central point of contact, rather than 28 odd different states on any major issue So, certainly Washington would like to see the EU together and its special relationship with Britain makes that process all the easier when Britain has a major seat in Brussels RT:The US State Department says John Kerry wants to be part of the talks between London and Brussels But is the Brexit process really any of Washington s business? PH:That is very interesting if that is the case The reality right now is that the Tory conservative party is dragging its heels on invoking Article 50, which once it is invoked would set in motion a two year period of exits and then renegotiating Britain s terms and conditions of that exit They have already announced that it is probably not going to happen before the Conservative convention in October and then the change of leadership as well David Cameron has already hinted this is something for the next conservative leader to do be that Boris Johnson or Theresa May So, they ve already kicked the can down an additional six months So, we are looking at an exit of a possibly five year window Some legal experts say it might be even longer than five years; it could be up to 10 years We ll see Remainers now grasping every piece of economic bad news like shipwrecked mariners reaching for flotsam RT:An EU without Britain would arguably make the Union weaker So would that actually make Europe more dependent on the US?

LR:First of all, you can t trust Erdogan He is not a trustworthy guy He already has upped the blackmail payment he wants Greeks should be blocking the migrants; it is destroying Greece They would like to destroy the rest of Europe George Soros and company They shouldn t be allowed to get away with it Turkey, handle your own problems If you want to bring in Syrian Muslims to settle in Turkey go do it But that s not other countries problems I am sure many Turks don t like it because it means the destruction of Turkish property rights, as well as European property rights ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/339563-eu-george-soros-migrants/

"5 Mar, 2016","I'm confused, can anyone help me? Part 6","There are some strange happenings in the world of late and I m confused Very confused Can anyone help me? is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 is a journalist, writer, broadcaster and blogger His award winning blog can be found at www neilclark66 blogspo tdotco m He tweets on politics and world affairs@NeilClark66 The first thing I m confused about is the claim made this week by Supreme Allied NATO Commander General Strangelove, sorry, Breedlove, that Putin (along with Assad) are deliberately weaponizing the migration/refugee crisis to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve According to Breedlove, Russia and the Syrian government are deliberately bombing people in Syria to get them to leave the country and cause major problems for Europe How absolutely deplorable! What utter swines they must be!But hang on a minute I could have sworn that there was quite a significant refugee crisis before Russian intervention in Syria began last autumn and before the Syrian government launched new offensives If the crisis began long before the Russian bombing how can Russia be responsible for it? Here s anarticlefrom the BBC website from September 2014, a full year before Russia s intervention in Syria on the big increase in the number of refugees/migrants coming from Libya after 2011 Libya was a country which was bombed and regime changed by the US and its allies in 2011 so surely it s more accurate to accuse them of weaponising the migration crisis? Many refugees are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq, again countries where the US and its allies invaded Can we blame Putin and Assad for this? As to Syrian President Bashar Assad wanting to drive people out of his country in order to cause trouble for Europe, he has stated on more than one occasion that he would like to see the refugees return Of course they can come back without any action being taken against them by the government We want people to come back to Syria, hesaidin February Also in February, Assad urged European leaders to help refugees return to Syria I would like to ask every person who left Syria to come back, he said, asreportedby Telesur And this is the man who along with Putin we are told is deliberately weaponising migration by the NATO commander? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused very confused in fact by the portrayal of Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton as a progressive who in a US Presidential election contest with Donald Trump would be the lesser of two evils Now, from what I ve read about her, Clinton seems to be a serial warmonger and regime changer whose actions in government caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (including women and black people) and have undoubtedly made the world a more dangerous place Gary Leupp documented Mrs Clinton s foreign policy record in this 2015article Among Hillary s boasts are that she urged her husband to bomb the Federal Republic Yugoslavia The innocent civilians killed in the illegal humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia of 1999 which Clinton urged included passengers on a train, staff at Serbian television and 73 Kosovan Albanians in a convoy an attack that NATO had attempted toblameon Yugoslav forces Four years later, Hillary sided with hard right republicanparty hawks and supported the illegal invasion of Iraq Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa But in 2011 Clinton, now Secretary of State, helped destroy all that and turn Libya into a failed state and a base for IS You don t have to a cheerleader for Muammar Gaddafi to condemn the brutal way he was murdered, but Clinton thought it was all rather funny We came We saw He died! Last week on George Galloway s Sputnik show on RT, the Green Party s Dr Jill Stein told us Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support How does Clinton s record make her progressive ? Or has the word progressive today been redefined to mean an enthusiastic for war whose campaign isbankrolledby Wall Streetand the hedge fund billionaire GeorgeSoros I m confused Can anyone help me? The EU referendum Now there are some good arguments for the UKstaying inthe EU and some very good ones forleavingtoo But I m confused about some of the claims as to what would happen if Britons voted for Brexit in June s Referendum We retoldthat the economy would collapse,investment would leave, jobs would be lost, that we need to be in the EU for national security and in order todealwith Russian aggression Hillary Clinton never found a war she didn t support @DrJillSteinUS Presidential Candidate tells@georgegallowaypic twitter com/evltbtGyuo We re told a Brexit would shock the world economy And the UK itself wouldbreak up But hang on, until 1973, Britain wasn t in the EEC/EU And our economy far from being in a state of collapse was doing rather well In 1969/70, just three years before the UK joined the EEC, the country enjoyed a record balance of payments surplus of 550m As Iwrotein the New Statesman in 2010 about this period: The public finances were also in rude health a borrowing requirement of 1 96bn in 1967/68 had been transformed into a surplus of 600m by the end of 1969 And, fuelled by the export boom, GNP grew by over 6 per cent between the middle of 1967 and the end of 1969 Not only did living standards rise considerably in this pre EEC accession era, but the UK wasn t subject to a Soviet invasion either, or at least I don t remember us being under Red Army occupation when I was growing up in the early 70s (although we did have lots of excellent children s programmes from eastern European communist countries on the tv) So our national security clearly didn t have anything to do with membership of the EEC/EU Of course that was over 40 years ago and its true that it s a different world today But Norway and Switzerland aren t in the EU and didn t seem to be doing too badly the last time I visited Nor did they appear to be under a Russian military occupation The thing is that the dramatic claims made about what will happen if UK voters do vote for Brexit are being made by some very distinguished people Leading bankers City people, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, top business leaders Tony Blair They can t be trying to pull the wool over our eyes, can they? They surely wouldn t be trying to scare us to vote in a certain way? I m confused Can anyone help me? I m confused still confused about the ongoing investigation into the MH 17 plane disaster After the tragedy, in which 298 people were killed, we were told that the US possessed satellite imagery and raw radar data which was strong evidence that the plane was shot down by a surface to air missile We know because we observed it by imagery that at the moment of the shoot down, we detected a launch, from that area (rebel controlled), and our trajectory shows that it went through the aircraft, said US Secretary of State John Kerry in a CNN interview in July 2014 But we now learn that investigators into the crash have no satellite imagery or raw radar data Now surely if the US did have such evidence, they d have shared it with the investigators? At a press conference this week, State Department spokesman John Kirbyrefusedto answer questionsabout what data the US had shared with the investigators Now if it was so clear cut that rebels supported by Russia did shoot the plane down and the US hadevidenceto prove this, surely we would have seen it by now? After all the plane disaster took place in July 2014, over 18 months ago I m confused Can anyone help me? I m also confused about what we ve been told by western political figures about Russia s intervention in Syria When Russia began its air campaign in late September 2015, we were told that it wasn t really fighting IS but targeting civilians and moderate Syria opposition forces You have a strong propaganda message that says you re doing one thing while in fact you are doing something completely different and when challenged you just flatly deny it,‚ÄùUK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond aggressivelystatedat the Tory Party conference in October But a couple of weeks later, when the Russian Metrojet passenger plane came down in the Sinai, with the loss of all 224 people on board, Hammond was quick to say IS was responsible and said that the downing of the airliner had been a warning shot for Russia But if Russia hadn t really been hitting IS, as Hammond had claimed, why on earth would IS wish to take down a Russian passenger plane?Since then, we ve seen renewed allegations that Russia isn t hitting IS But some western media has been caught using footage of Russian attacks on IS and actuallypassing them offas the work of the US and its allies! We know that since Russia s intervention, the IS advance has not only been checked, but the group has suffered significant reversals Russian air support for the Syrian army means that it is now far more difficult for Isis to win easy victories such as its capture of Palmyra in May,wroteveteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn in the Independent in January: It had been conceivable, if not likely, that Assad s rule would crumble under pressure and IS would be the beneficiary This is no longer the case How could any of these things have happened if Russia was actually IS s air force Surely IS would be advancing if Russia s campaign was really aiding the group? I m confused Can anyone help me? Finally I m confused about Turkey and British support for democratic values British Prime Minister David CameronwantsTurkey in the EU and said in December 2014 that getting Turkey in the EU was a long standing goal for Britain His views on Turkey are shared by most neocons When Turkey shot down a Russian plane in November, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond praised Turkey as an important ally Yesterday in Turkey, policeraidedthe offices of Zaman, an opposition newspaper A Turkish court has ruled to sack the entire editorial team of the newspaper, which is critical of President Erdogan, and for them to be replaced by a three member board appointed by the court By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan s government is steamrolling over human rights,‚Äùsays Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Of events in the last year in Turkey, Amnestysaid: The media faced unprecedented pressure from the government; free expression online and offline suffered significantly The right to freedom of peaceful assembly continued to be violated Impunity for human rights abuses persisted The independence of the judiciary was further eroded Now, neocons always tell us that they re implacably opposed to repressive political systems and are strong supporters of freedom and democracy so much so that they believe in going to war to fight for these worthy causes So why has there beenno condemnationof Turkey by David Cameron and Philip Hammond?

I m sure George Soros, uncrowned King of Ukraine,approvesheartily 1944 opens with the chilling description: When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say, we re not guilty ù I had to write it It is a memorial song and it is difficult for me to sing it, ùsaysthe singer Jamala, aka Susana Jamaladinova, who was born into a mixed Tatar Armenian family I m old enough to remember the time when Eurovision songs were upbeat and designed to make us all feel happier There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow, went part of the lyrics by the Dutch winning entry Ding a dong, performed by Teach In back in 1975 But Jamala is no Getty Kaspers, the lead singer of Teach In Her song is meant to distress us and to turn us against Russia There s quite a few good reasons to get angry over what Ukraine has done especially if, like me, you are a long standing Eurovision fan who s been watching the event since the 1970s The provocative, politically motivated decision to chose 1944 as their Song for Europe goes against the whole spirit of Eurovision The contest, whichcelebratedits 60th birthday last year, was supposed to bring the peoples of Europe together, not remind us of historical injustices and ignite geopolitical rows Eurovision started in 1956, when the horrors of WW2 were a very recent memory But rather than live in the past, Eurovision in its early years was all about looking forward When historical events were mentioned it was not for political reasons When Johnny Logan performed What s Another Year , the winner in 1980 for Ireland, he wasn t singing about the Anglo Irish Troubles, but about people coming to terms with the death of their nearest and dearest Jamala, by contrast, is simply politicking The place for that is on the Larry Kingshow, Ms Jamaladinova, not at Eurovision Just imagine if other countries entered their own versions of 1944 ? Believe it or not, it s not just Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars who have had some very bad things done to them in the past The Serbs could sing about the genocide they suffered at the hands of the Ustase in World War Two, as well as the illegal NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999 The Hungarians could sing about the Ottoman occupation of their country and the enslavement/deportation of three million Magyars Russia could sing about the 5 7m Russian (as distinct from Soviet) soldiers killed in WW2 after the German invasion, not to mention the 210,000 killed in France s invasion of 1812 The Bosnians on the horrors of Srebrenica The Brits on the way London, Coventry and other major cities were Blitzed by the Luftwaffe Or the raping and pillaging of theVikings And the Irish could sing about the terrible things the English had done to them down the years And so on Is this really what the Eurovision Song Contest should be about? European history is full of bloodshed, full of atrocities and even genocides Few countries in Europe haven t had some terrible crimes committed against them at some point and on top of that there s also the imperialist crimes of certain European countries to consider But it seems, for obvious geopolitical reasons, crimes committed against the people of Ukraine at the order of Joseph Stalin are the only ones we are meant to be focusing on and singing about today It s not the first time those with an anti Russian agenda have tried to use the Eurovision Song Contest to further their campaign In 2009, Georgia, clearly still smarting at how the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia had backfired a year earlier, selected an entry entitled: We don t Wanna Put In The artists did not deny their song was a protest against Russian policies The song wasbannedby the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and rightly so Therulesof Eurovision state that No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the Eurovision Song Contest ùUkraine s 2016 offering is highly likely to meet the same fate as Georgia s 2009 entry when the EBU meet to consider it on 14th March Which begs the question: Why did the Ukrainians allow a song which breaks the rules to be entered in the first place? There s method in Kiev s apparent madness If Jamala is allowed to sing the song she just had to write , in contravention of the Eurovision rules, then it ll be championed by all Russia bashers on the continent We ll all be under pressure to give the song Douze Points to show our solidarity with Ukraine If, as must surely happen, the song is banned, then Ukraine plays the victim and will get the sympathy vote Prepare for a spate of articles in Russophobic neocon media claiming that free speech is under threat in Europe because we can t hear 1944 I m sure we ll get at least one claiming that Putin exerted pressure on the EBU himself Instead of #JeSuisCharlie, it ll be a case of #JeSuisJamala The West s free speech crusaders are of course brazen hypocrites They didn t say anything when Hungary got into trouble in last year s Eurovision not for the lyrics of their song, which was called Wars for nothing but because one of the captions in the song s videocontainedthe words: 2014 Gaza two thirds of the victims were civilians, including more than 500 children Israel wasn t mentioned by name and the song clearly was about commemorating all the innocent victims of war But that didn t stop the Israeli Ambassador to Hungary lodging acomplaintto Hungary s broadcasting authority, with the result that the offending words in the video were removed While Keith Walker, of Euronews, did pick up on the double standards, tweeting Israel who s PM marched in Paris defending free speech, protests Hungary s Eurovision entry there was a deafening silence from those who would be first off the blocks to slam Russia if they had been the ones protesting Wars for nothing Already the sort of media outlets you d expect, have been enthusiastically promoting Jamala and 1944 Step forward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) Now the Crimean Tatars are on occupied territory and it is very hard for them I would not want to see history repeat itself, Jamalatoldthe US Congress funded station RFE/RL is smart power Your steadfast commitment to your mission and the work you do is an essential part of everything America stands for, saidformer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 Remember, folks, Eurovision is not supposed to be about politics! The Ukrainian authorities are going to try to use the song capitalizing on the tragedy of the Tartars to impose on European viewers a false picture of alleged harassment of the Tartars in the Russian Crimea, Crimea s deputy prime minister Russlan Balbek hassaid He s right to be offended The head of Ukraine s National Remembrance Museum has also done his best tostir things up He said that should Jamala win the contest in Stockholm, next year s event would be held in Sevastopol Now there s just one small problem with that Sevastopol is no longer part of Ukraine It s part of Russia The city council of Sevastopol has declared that the only way it could host Eurovision 2017 is if Russia wins this year Does Ukraine really want us to go to war over where the Eurovision Song Contest is held? To debase an international song contest in the way that Ukraine has done is disgraceful By focusing on crimes which occurred in the 1940s, Jamala is also helping to divert international attention away from the economic plight of Ukraine today A country that was once the food basket of eastern Europe is now, thanks to the illegal US/EU sponsored coup of 2014, a veritable basket case It s hard to get one s head round the figures Ukraine s foreign trade has slumped 31 percent in just one year Ukraine s foreign trade collapses 31% in just one year, post EU backed couphttps:// tdotco /xVfNUpkOiH Inflation last February wasestimatedto be running at 64 5 percent a month Ukraine s GDP meanwhile fell for six successive quarters following the democratic revolution of February 2014, while real wages fell by almost 25 percent in the year May 2014 May 2015 The people in Maidan were supposed to protesting against corruption, but Ukraine surprise, surprise, remains themost corruptnation in Europe In fact, looking at how wretched everyday life is for ordinary people in liberated Ukraine today, one can fully understand why Jamala is so keen to take us back to 1944 If she was really brave, she d have penned a song called 2014 that discussed the regime change activities of Victoria Nuland and their consequences She handed us cookies out in the square, and when we next looked at our wage packets, there was nothing there You can follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization úTV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/333580-ukraines-song-europe-jamala/

"16 Feb, 2016",Soros (seriously) underestimates his audience by blaming Putin for EU refugee crisis,"George Soros, the billionaire investor whose own native country of Hungary accused him of betraying Europe ù by supporting refugees escaping war torn regions of the Middle East has turned around and blamed Vladimir Putin for the humanitarian crisis Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream @Robert_Bridge In anopinion piecereleased last week, Soros seeks to prove that President Putin was working to foster the EU s disintegration ùby flooding the continent with refugees, allegedly as a result of the Russian military s foray into Syria where it has dealt a lethal blow to Islamic State forces George Soros is no fool, of course He will go down in the history books as the man who broke the Bank of England ù an achievement that, while conspicuously lacking a moral chromosome and ethical outlook, took no small amount of mental finesse to pull off And that s why Soros s anti Putin rant is so strange: it is so illogical and blatantly wrong headed to the point where a sense of desperation oozes between the lines Soros s argument comes down to this: Putin s decision to launch a military offensive in Syria was not to halt the encroachment of Islamic State, the most despicable gang of terrorist thugs to step foot on the world stage, but primarily as a means of dividing Europe ù And I quote: An EU that is coming apart at the seams will not be able to maintain the sanctions it imposed on Russia following its incursion into Ukraine, ùhe wrote On the contrary, Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti European parties that he has carefully cultivated ù Unsurprisingly, this line of rubbish failed to hoodwink the overwhelming majority of readers which Soros apparently believes are too ignorant to connect the dots between Syria, Russia and Europe Indeed, it was sheer entertainment perusing the Guardian sreader commentsection following the article, which proves Soros seriously underestimates his audience s grasp of geopolitical issues My personal favorite anti Soros jibe came courtesy of Peter Whitelaw, who wrote: We ve been bombing the Middle East off and on for the past 30 years †Russia does it for two months and they are the biggest threat ever †If we re not bombing Middle Eastern countries then we re selling arms to them so they can do the bombing instead of us ù To that succinct comment I would add the question: If Soros really thinks it such a horrible thing that refugees from the Middle East and beyond are storming the gates of Europe, why has he been advocating on behalf of just such a scenario for many years now? In October, †Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, whose country finally halted the flow of refugees by installing a razor tipped fence along the length of its southern border,called out Sorosby name when he said the schemes of well organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation states and leader who have never been elected ùcould come to fruition Europe has been betrayed, ùOrban continued If we don t stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here ù Orban s public chastisement of Soros behavior is not without foundation One month before the Hungarian leader voiced his concerns, Soros had published yet another opinionmasterpiece, this one entitled, Rebuilding the Asylum System ù In it, he expressed bewilderment that each †member state [of the EU] has selfishly focused on its own interests ùto the point where the asylum seekers have been the main victims ù(Incidentally, I ve yet to hear Soros come out and defend the hundreds of German women †who were sexuallyassaultedby refugee men during the course of New Year s Eve celebrations) With an arrogance that almost defies belief, Soros goes on to argue as if the European people have absolutely no say in the matter whatsoever that since the origin of the current crisis is Syria, the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority ùtherefore the europeanunion has an obligation to distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states ù Blood and Tears: Chaotic scenes at Hungarian border as#refugeescome under tear gashttps:// tdotco /TXvLxfdfoDpic twitter com/mgBnHDKXwD This breathtaking comment is followed by a 6 point plan †for the EU to follow It should suffice for our purpose to just quote Soros first point, which alone probably launched 1,000 right wing parties in Europe: The EU has to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually for the foreseeable future and †provide 15,000 ($16,800) per asylum seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs ù As my colleague Lionel would say, let that comment marinate for a moment: The EU has to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually for the foreseeable future? Really? Now take a second and perform a simple reality check and ask, Which individual is really seeking the disintegration of Europe: George Soros, with his Open invitation to every asylum seeker in the Middle East and beyond (it has already been exposed in the German media that the majority of asylum seekers entering Europe do not come from Syria, but are predominantly from other countries that were previously torn asunder by US backed military offensives/adventures, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) or Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was formally invited by Damascus to initiate a military offensive against ISIS forces, which up to that point had not been noticeably weakened despite Western claims that it was fighting the terrorist organization? Furthermore, what would Russia stand to gain by flooding the European continent of which it is a geographical part of with desperate asylum seekers, many of whom may actually be card carrying members of lethal terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and Islamic State? Finally, Russia s economy would hardly recover anytime soon if Europe its largest trading partner is somehow reduced to violence, sectarian strife and chaos as Soros somehow asserts Given Soros powerful influence and clout among some European bureaucrats, it seems his outrageous anti Russia position has gained some traction among some predictable circles This is especially the case with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is desperately in need of a scapegoat for the refugee crisis as far right nationalist groups, likePegida, are enjoying a groundswell of public enthusiasm not just in Germany but also across Europe Exactly one day before Soros anti Putin piece hit the newsstands, Merkel was paying a visit to Turkey, of all places, where she Well, let s just let George Soros explain what she was doing there: Angela †Merkel flew to Ankara on February 9 to make last minute arrangements with the Turkish government to induce the refugees already in Turkey to prolong their stay there She offered to airlift 200,000 300,000 Syrian refugees annually directly to Europe on the condition that Turkey prevent them from going to Greece and will accept them back if they do so ù Yes! With a wave of Merkel s magic wand, no more unsightly photo opportunities from nosy journalists featuring throngs of unwashed hordes storming the EU gates Why, that would have derailed George Soros oops, I mean Vladimir Putin s plan to overrun Europe with a future low wage labor pool and a divide and conquer carnival Just what Europe needs as their venal leaders in reality, nothing more than mindless technocrats enforce harsh austerity measures on young and old alike Merkel just cut through all the unsightly mess and awarded the refugees frequent flier mileage points right smack into the heart of Europe where they will be paid 15,000 ($16,800) each †if Soros gets his way courtesy of European taxpayers that is, those who are still employed and can pay taxes Meanwhile, last but not least, Soros rarely spouts venom at Turkey, Saudi Arabia and all of the other usual suspects who are in some way complicit in the extremely curious rise of Islamic State, a group of savages, we are led to believe, that possessed enough business savvy to become the owners and operators of a lucrative oil business, exporting vast amounts of Syria s finest right past the Turkish border and into European gas tanks Nor did Soros have any harsh words of condemnation for Turkish President Erdogan, who extended his thanks to Russia for cleaning up Syria s terrorist infestation problem by shooting a Russian fighter jet out of a clear blue sky in November, thereby ratcheting up tensions in the Syrian theater to unprecedented levels Unfortunately, individuals like George Soros, who certainly have the funds and the brains to make a positive difference in places like Europe and Syria, have chosen instead to spread vicious anti Russia propaganda so thin and conspicuous it actually flies back and damages their own misguided cause, as opposed to the purposeful actions of their purported enemies @Robert_Bridge This article first appeared in a slightly altered form inRethinking Russia The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/332655-soros-says-putin-blame-syria/
"13 Feb, 2016",George Soros: A psychopath‚Äôs psychopath,"According to Soros, Russia s strategy is to avoid collapse by making the EU implode first by exacerbating the migration crisis and stoking Islamophobia ù On February 11,the Guardianran anarticleby George Soros which had run a day earlierhereentitled Putin is a bigger threat to Europe s existence than Isis ù After a quick check of my vital signs, I confirmed that I was indeed awake and the article was real and in the Guardian not The Onion Before I look at the tissue of untruths which make up the substance of Soros article, a few general words about psychopaths are in order I have met a few psychopaths in my life a pernicious but small time example is a real estate salesman ù in Spain who cost my family a great deal of time and money The real problem with psychopaths big time and small time is not primarily that they do bad things, but that we non psychopaths are ill prepared to deal with the fundamental difference between us and them We people with operational consciences think (wrongly) that everyone is like us We are shackled to the assumption that just because we would not do unspeakably evil things or would be unable to live with ourselves if we did all other people work the same way They do not When a psychopath lies, or steals, or manipulates or does whatever he thinks is required to get what he wants he has no greater emotional connection with his actions than you or I have with yesterday s lunch We, the non psychopaths, tell little lies and do little wrongs But we have a limit beyond which we will not go For the psychopath, scale makes no difference Stealing a family s savings, or crashing an economy, or destroying a country is of no more consequence to the psychopath than deciding not to return ten bucks to a cashier who had made a mistake And no matter what evil the psychopath meticulously plotted and practiced against you, to him, what happens is your fault Always Which brings me back to George Soros Inthe Guardian sarticle, then, Soros claims the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that President Vladimir Putin s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State ù The assumptions here are based on pure falsehood My colleague, the diligent and forthright journalist and writerGear√≥id √ì Colm in, laid an axe as sharp as any to the root of the notion that the so called War on Terror (taken to include Islamic State) serves anything other than the interests of what √ì Colm in rightly calls a tiny and particularly tyrannical ruling elite ù In an interview withRT, √ì Colm in said, There is no War on Terror There is a war which is being waged using terrorist proxy groups and they are being used against nation states who are resisting US and Israeli hegemony And they are also being used as a means of disciplining the work forces in Europe In a period of mass unemployment and austerity, you now have terrorist attacks being committed by terrorists funded, armed and trained by Western intelligence agencies There is no such thing as ISIS ISIS is a creation of the United States ù Soros and his ilk created and benefit from what Soros calls Islamic State, ù yet his argument not only disregards that fact, it kicks blame in the direction of the one major power Russia which has taken steps to deal with this US creation Soros goes on to make a number of other accusations against Russia, failing at any time to note that Russia alone has a mandate from the legitimate government of Syria, or that Russia is seriously engaged in cleaning house in Syria, a job the US was only simulating Acknowledgement of Russia s successes in Syria comes from many quarters, includingSeymour Hersh Hersh is a high profile American journalist, but one incapable of understanding the reasons for US policy towards Syria, bless him Soros next point is that Putin s aim is to foster the EU s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees ù The truth is that Russia s natural ally is Germany and preventing that alliance is the primary aim of the US government at least according toStratfor, a US intelligence agency Germany s efficiency and organizational abilities combined with Russia s raw materials, inventive genius, and good relations with China, is the combination those funding and directing ISIS least want to see By occupying Germany with an army of aggressive, unskilled, culturally insoluble economic migrants from Africa and elsewhere, the chess players at the board of realpolitik are attempting to head off that natural outcome Soros part in destabilizing Europe is well attested The Daily Mailreported back in November 2015 that Soros was busy telling the EU to take at least a million ù refugees every year In the same article, Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is quoted as saying, This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state ù Orban went on, This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros ù Soros described in the article as a funder of pro migration groups all over the world ù responded to Orban s comments by arguing that his beliefs uphold European values ù I don t know what Soros means by European values, ù but I assume it includes lots more immigration for us unilaterally decided upon by Mr Soros As prime minister of Hungary, Orban is a man with, perhaps, better access than most to the truth about George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary the source for which information is his own father s book Masquerade Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary Thus, Soros has moved effortlessly from collaborating with the Nazis against his fellow Jews an occupation (if you will excuse the pun) he makes little effort to hide totellingindigenous European peoples what the ethnic make up of their countries should be He was also instrumental in the destruction of Ukraine As reported byNew American, Soros has a giant footprint in Ukraine Similar to his operations in dozens of other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens ofmillions of dollarsinto Ukrainian non governmental organizations (NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into a more open and democratic society ù We have good reason to take George Soros seriously Soros article downplays Putin s strategic prowess before going on to anticipate regime change in Russia in 2017 as a result of bankruptcy forced upon it by Western sanctions and crushed oil prices He then appears to credit Putin with masterminding a collapse ù in Europe and of anticipating benefits for Russia in the aftermath He notes, As Merkel correctly foresaw, the migration crisis has the potential to destroy it ù If you find yourself asking here: Why then did she create that crisis? ù that is because you are not a psychopath Soros article begins its descent with metaphysical and social observations, which from someone without billions of dollars behind them would be seen as merely subjective musings, before landing squarely on the runway of identifying Putin s Russia as the real threat This is not simplychutzpah The traits Soros exhibits are those of textbook psychopathy: blaming others for his own actions and attacking the victim is what the psychopath does Here, Soros disregards entirely his own extensive role in creating the problem he purports to seek to solve; meanwhile, he accuses Russia, the only country to man up to the war on Syria, of being behind the migration ù Soros has spent millions engineering Soros is part of a cabal which plans the overthrow of countries at dinner Psychopathy is the baseline requirement for membership So if you think conscience will make him and his friends stop at some point before you and your family reach conditions materially identical to those experienced by the inhabitants of the Donbass region or if you think that Western Europe is beyond the scope of their plans for engineered collapse just because you wouldn t do something like that you will find that you are wrong When Europe is in tatters, and its men (whom Soros money helped turn in one lifetime from actual men into effeminized liberal cultural lemmings) are squawking in disbelief as their pampered delusions are shattered in the collapse ù Soros envisages, Soros will not care No matter that this is Europe and it is your life under attack this time, and not that of brown people or Eastern Europeans It won t make any difference For a psychopath it s simple: you let him do it it s your fault The

"2 Feb, 2016","Gangs, populism, and conspiracy theory overshadow West‚Äôs role in refugee crisis","In the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, Europe continues to lurch to the right, both in the visible form of neo Nazi gangs terrorizing the streets, and also with politicians playing to right wing populism From Stockholm to Dover, gangs have been terrorizing refugees or anyone they perceive to look like one, while also attacking anti fascist protestors These gangs by their own admission are reacting to what they perceive to be their own government s failure in responding to the crisis † The fact their governments caused the crisis is a fact which is apparently lost on them In reality, all these gangs are achieving is to simply play into the hands of the very same governments who happily pipe up about the problems associated with the refugee crisis, while at the same time continue to cause it, with the bombs they drop, and the terror groups and regimes they prop up Nobody in their right mind wants to see any of the crimes associated with the refugee crisis take place, whether we are taking about wars which cause people to leave their homes, or the problems associated with Europe s inability to deal with the crisis States in Europe have laws in place to deal with murder, rape, assault, and any other crimes which take place † All of us want to see an end to misogyny and murder wherever it manifests, whether it is committed by groups or individuals, or committed by states on an industrial scale However, in the current climate, any crime committed by anyone perceived to be a refugee, is immediately brandished in the headlines as proof that all refugees are bad † The same yardstick or measure is not applied to other ethnicities or faiths † If it were, it would probably offer some uncomfortable truths, or reveal the many holes in such pseudo scientific thinking The phenomena of street gangs and politicians playing to the right, is a result of Europe and the West reacting to the crisis, rather than taking an honest look at its causes The way of life many of these groups (and politicians) are talking about protecting , is less to with any Christian values, and is in reality, grounded in propping up the failed economic model of neo colonial capitalism, which itself is predicated on the continuation of illegal wars and subversion of the Middle East and Africa In the same way this model has fooled many of the working classes in Britain, themselves victim of this model, into voting for a political party of the ruling class offering them more of the same economic safety ultimately causing their misery under austerity , this thinking has also caused a dangerous form of reactionary nationalism in Europe to resurface Rather than look at the root cause of the crisis, imperialism, and understand the relationship between war and Western economies, the masses have been duped into believing that the refugee crisis starts and ends with the actual refugees themselves, despite the obvious reasons as to why they have arrived in Europe This thinking is completely westernized and Eurocentric, and provides a convenient scapegoat for the architects of war: Rather than lay the blame for the crisis at the hands of governments and the neo colonial institutions which support their interests, the refugees are blamed † Women, children, it makes no difference as newspaper headlines last week show Or worse still, as we are seeing, more and more people are buying into the idea that a shadowy cabal is behind the crisis, or George Soros and Rothschild Zionists, all intent of course, on destroying Europe s way of life by causing a mass exodus from Africa and the Middle East, to Europe s green pastures Apart from being untrue, this thinking also reeks of anti Semitism, and the sort of racism which should remain dead and buried and which needs no revival † It also is very damaging to the left, because it delegitimizes actual progressive thought † The more this thinking occupies the centre ground helped by the media, the further away from a solution we drift This simplistic scapegoating also diverts away from the fact that it is developed Western economies and the policy which underpins and drives them, which has led to this crisis There is no conspiracy † It s more like business as usual † The refugee crisis is a direct result of both colonialism and in the modern era, neo colonialism, the more sophisticated incarnation of modern capitalism, implementing its own barbarism under the perverse justification of humanitarian intervention In other words, as Europe s thinking goes, It s not enough that we used to occupy and colonize you, you clearly remain incapable of governing yourselves, and so therefore, it is our job to come and do it for you, and to democratize you in the form of bombs and McDonalds † When you come to our shores fleeing our bombs, we will do anything and everything to avoid blaming those who should be blamed including politicians, the wars they advocate, and the consumerism we worship ù It is this psychology, or psychological deficiency depending on your view, which underpins the origin of the refugee crisis, and also which now, rather than seeking to diagnose it, will do anything to explain away what is happening except of course look at the actual cause No shadowy cabal or conspiracy theory is needed to explain what is happening here † People are fleeing their homelands because there is a very real conspiracy by Western governments and its proxies to destabilize and destroy them German police should have right to shoot refugees illegally crossing border AfD leaderhttps:// tdotco /yrqa1EUDNXpic twitter com/SfYnobWCtO The relationships between Africa, China, and the Middle East are still developing Russia and China at least, while far from having a perfect relationship with Africa, are at least offering a functional one, and more importantly are perfectly distinguishable one from the West s imperial relationship with Africa and the Middle East The West s strategy in Africa the Middle East, in the Wake of the Arab Sting , is simply one of divide and ruin , meaning that if we (Western governments) can t control your resources, then no one can ùThe West would rather destroy whole countries, and turn them into failed states and torch their resources, than allow states to have a functional relationship with each other with indigenous populations benefiting from the wealth This is how the problem manifests internationally At home, Europe and the West would rather blame a shadowy cabal, or delude themselves that the others Arabs, Muslims or Africans are the problem rather than their own governments This is the problem Europe is failing to recognize, which is giving the US also complicit in wars of aggression, a free pass Until we start to diagnose the problem, rather than engage in right wing populism and neo liberal denialism, ugly

The fact is that Russia s intervention in Syria has blocked the regime change plans of the Western elite, which is exactly why the likes of George Soros are so angry Soros wasn t the only George talking twaddle in the Swiss Alps British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborneaddressed British business leaders at the CBI s lunch, where he hailed the economic achievements of the UK government, and called the UK economy a chink of light cutting through the global gloom Of course Osborne failed to mention the fact that as Chancellor he presided over thelongest drop in real wagesfor over 50 years French Prime Minister Manuel Valls made headlines when he told the BBC at Davos the quite stunning news that the refugee crisis was destabilizing Europe He did not of course mention France s role in destabilizing Syria and Libya and that this destabilization (together with the US led invasion of Iraq in 2003) was the major cause of the refugee crisis Refugees are not destabilising Europe Europe is destabilising themhttps:// tdotco /YMiz7i3h2Ovia@MiddleEastEye Wherever we look at Davos, we see hypocrisy and double standards Oh look, there s the millionaire rock star Bono, the anti poverty campaigner whose band U2 moved part of their business from Ireland to the Netherlands in order to pay less tax And who s that giving an interview about the current refugee crisis triggered by western interventionist policies in the Middle East why it s the serial interventionist Tony Blair! And who s this impartial observer saying that the best result you might be able to get in Syria was benign Balkanization, benign cantonization Why it s Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu! Other highlights of Davos included Harry Potter actressEmma Watsongiving a talk on gender inequality Women share this planet 50/50 and they are under represented, their potential astonishingly untapped, ù Watson told a forum where just 18 percent of the attendees were women (up a whopping 1 percent from 2015 ) It s not just a sexual imbalance you see at Davos, but there s a distinct preponderance of North Americans and Europeans at an event billed as a WORLD Economic Forum as thisdiagramdemonstrates One of the relatively few Africans to get an invitation to the elite get together in the Swiss Alps, was Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda Rwanda has undoubtedly made some progress under Kagame, but it s come at a cost The latest Amnestyreporttells us: Freedoms of expression and association in Rwanda continued to be unduly restricted by the authorities Rwandans were unable to openly express critical views on issues perceived as sensitive by the authorities and the environment for journalists, human rights defenders and members of the opposition remained repressive I wonder if George Soros had a word with Mr Kagame about his passionate belief in the opensociety ? You don t have to be a Che Guevara or Rosa Luxemburg to wish that the World Economic Forum and all its hypocrisy, was confined to history The fact that business and political leaders can, over the space of a couple of days, meet everyone who matters ù isexactly what s wrongwith it and with the world, says Steve Hilton, a former director of strategy for David Cameron Hilton is right: It s ludicrous to look to Davos for solutions, as its exclusiveness is an integral part of the problem Q: How to avoid the impression the world is run by a global elite? A: All go to a luxury Swiss resort very yearpic twitter com/0cm9PJSFOj It s worth reflecting on how well the world was doing before Professor Klaus Schwab had his bright idea for a European Management Forum The 1960s was an era of great economic, social and cultural advances for ordinary people across the globe These advances continued into the 1970s The world had never before been so democratic and never before had its wealth been so evenly shared But starting with the coup which toppled the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and saw him replaced with the capital friendly dictator and human rights oppressor Augusto Pinochet, the global economic order was restructured in the interests of a tiny but very greedy elite who were unhappy that their share of the cake had shrunk in the genuinely progressive period following World War Two A hallmark of this neoliberal era has been the way states have been captured to serve the interests of international finance capital and giant global corporations Publicly owned assets have been privatized, providing rich pickings for the banks and financial institutions who handle the sales Meanwhile, the very rich have enjoyed generous tax cuts if they even pay tax at all Meanwhile, austerity is imposed on the majority Davos has played a key role in this process If the World Economic Forum has a habit of coming up with big business friendly solutions it s no surprise, as itsmembers comprise 1,000 of the world s top corporations, global enterprises usually with more than US$5 billion in turnover Last week, as the well heeled attendees arrived in Davos in their private jets, Oxfamreleasedits latest report on global inequality The report revealed that the richest 1% now own more than the rest of the people in the world combined A more shocking indictment of forty odd years of neoliberalism would be hard to find It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super rich so few, you could fit them all on a single coach, says Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB s chief executive He might also have said we could fit the small group of the global super rich in one hotel in Davos, which is where most of them probably were last week We won t get any meaningful change arising from anything proposed at Davos because the iniquitous status quo is in the interest of those who fund the World Economic Forum To solve the problems of today we need to do away with elite gatherings attended by everyone who matters and re democratize our politics and our economies In short, we need to take power away from the billionaires who meet each year at Davos, and return it to the people Follow Neil Clark on Twitter@neilclark66 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 ì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/330046-davos-problem-global-economy-elite/
"24 Jan, 2016",Invasion of Europe: The ship is going down,"It is sobering to realize that the supposed captains on the ship your forebears built over millennia are willfully detonating the bulkheads and drilling large holes in the hull whilst claiming there is nothing anyone could possibly have done The K√ºbler Ross model of trauma describes the emotional pathway for any European with an interest in protecting the continent his forebears created from the perfidy of national leaders whose actions will breed him and his children out of existence First there was denial: surely Angela Merkel couldn t be so stupid as to sink the European ship? Next came anger as news of theorganized attacksby so called asylum seekers on European white women seeped through the checkpointsembeddedin the mainstream media machine Then came the stage known as bargaining as people thought they would settle for somerestrictions on numbersso long as the tidal wave was stopped And now we are at enforced acceptance: the tidal wave will not stop so get used to it with Jeremy Corbyn, for example,callingfor the UK to take similar numbers as Germany If you feel like you didn t vote for any of this, that s because you didn t Your opinion isn t worth the paper it s written on It s people likeGeorge Soroswho are making these decisions Your job is to shut up, pay taxes, and learn toget on boardwith this new round of social engineering and ethnic cleansing But now that it is obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that hand wringing apart the fix is in, it is interesting to observe how career politicians are talking now that the dust is settling on the new reality Because talk is all that they will do We are at the tipping point And once we get over that, the ship is going down, make no mistake The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, for example, has managed albeit belatedly to get an intellectual handle on what s going on: the refugee crisis isdestabilizingEurope Now, he does not mean what you and I mean by Europe: our countries, nations, languages and histories He s aBilderbergerso he has at least a mid level understanding of the actual plan and doesn t care about any of the things the people who vote for him care about He means the Union of European Soviet Socialist Republics; the Brussels oligarchy in other words The Guardianwrites: He said a message to refugees that said Come, you will be welcome ù provoked major shifts in population His grasp of the obvious now it is too late to do anything about it is impressive The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Europe was close to breaking point: We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks ùBut, he went on: No one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair weather system then it cannot survive ù Geert Wilders is described by the liberal press as a far right Dutch politician This means he has stayed roughly where our grandparents were while everyone else was processed by Cultural Marxism Wilders has called for the invading, marauding males to be locked up in asylum centers and for the safety of Dutch women and girls to be put first What a novel idea This isn t far right It is just right But, we already know, it will never happen RTinterviewedHansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party Mueller said: Germany now is somewhere at the edge of anarchy and sliding towards civil war, or to become a banana republic without any government He went on: Bavaria is the first region because we are affected the most we are living on the border to Austria where the influx of refugees stems from But the second regions of Germany where this happens are Saxony and Thuringia First of all, they have also borders to the Czech Republic, that s the first reason And the second reason is that in former Eastern Germany people are still aware of what it is living in a dictatorship They are feeling quite well that our so called democracy is sliding more and more towards a totalitarian state Interesting and objectively correct words But then Mueller does not hold any real power Donald Tusk, on the other hand as chief apparatchik in the European Soviet machine does have power He nowwarnsthat we have only two months to get things under control This means, of course, when after two months the invasion is only worse, we will be expected to accept the situation asfait accompli Tusk also has a holy reverence for the nonsense known as the Schengen Agreement and warned that if Europe fails to make the strategy work we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen, ùthe 26 nation passport free travel zone How complicated is it? There is nothing holy about the Schengen Agreement the UK is not party to it, for example But European leaders talk about it as though it weresomehow problematicto revoke it It s not The Schengen is an idea The invasion of Europe and the destruction of the ancient cultures within it, however, is very real If these were not refugees but infantrymen (even ones without guns) arriving from let s say North Korea, this problem would not have got to first base This is an invasion But because it is dressed up in the garb Europeans fall for every time the language of compassion we are now in a state where European womencannot walk unmolestedin their own streets oruse public poolswithout being subjected to degradation Given the political will, this problem can be fixed in a five minute conversation It s a group Skype call at best The fact that this doesn t happen belies the reality: the fix is in, and politicians like Valls and apparatchiks like Tusk are trying to distance themselves from the inevitable fallout This is why they are saying things they think people will want to hear: not because they are going to step up and do what is necessary, but because they don t want the coming chaos attached to their names The solution is obvious: stop saving all the ships arriving in Europe; put officers with real powers on borders, and have anyone without a passport or other valid ID immediately ejected from the EU space And border guards both at the peripheries of individual countries and the EU itself should be told in clear and uncertain terms what their job is: to protect what s behind them from what s in front of them If EU border guards pay was inversely indexed to the number of persons shown to have entered the EU illegally and if internal police had equivalent motivations this problem would be solved in a month If there is a genuine case for asylum based on the existing legal framework the place for that discussion is on the border of the EU, not within it Germany has followed Switzerland inconfiscating the assetsof refugees over a certain value shown to befour figure sumson average This will do nothing other than ensure that the next wave comes with nothing, or has it sent over in parcels later The real causes for invasion lie with neo colonialism and the banking cartel which drives it philanthropists such as Soros and NATO s genocide against Libya and the murder of Gaddafi who was holding back the population floodgates for us NATO has no compunction about killing people in very large numbers when it suits the bankers agenda The fact that Europe s military is pussy footing around now that we actually need soldiers to do their only legitimate job defend our borders suddenly everyone is Albert Schweitzer The case is so plain, even 16 year old German girls with no previous interest in politics are getting it Anyone who suggests taking effective action is labelled far right by the liberal media which panders to those whose intellects are bypassed by means of emotional trigger words such as compassion But the motif of the ship is a fair one When a ship goes down there are never enough lifeboats Sailors are trained to beat off with violence those still in the sea once the lifeboat is full If they do not everyone dies This is real compassion If there is a silver lining in this tale of corruption and perfidy it is this: the liberal s catch all justification for his crimes against his own people that of pleading compassion is no longer beyond criticism People have had enough Wanting your family and your culture to survive does not make you evil This is not a game; it is deadly serious And if the helm cannot be wrest from those bent on taking the ship down, it s time for those with the wit and the means to make a quiet move for the exits @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/329961-invasion-europe-migrants-brussels/
"20 Dec, 2015",Is the EU the new USSR?,"As in the Soviet Union, in the europeanunion the nation state is subordinate to the Union If the USSR was an evil empire , then what is the EU? Cameron was in Brussels for the recent summit For better of worse, this is the man the British people believe directs their government And he was in Brussels toask the EUif he could do some governing The answer in short was no To hear those the mainstream media refers to as our leaders talk about the EU one would think that leaving it implied national suicide Cameron himself ishyperbolicon the question of the need for Britain s inclusion The numbers do not agree The Daily Mail ran apiecerecently on Norway which it described as: prosperous, happy and free Its countryside is neat and well husbanded, its towns and cities orderly and comfortable Its people shame much of Europe by their command of foreign languages, and it runs its own affairs, trading cheerfully with the EU In the 30 years from 1971 to 2001, its gross domestic product rose by 177 per cent Denmark, which has been in the EU for much of that period, increased its GDP by 75 per cent and the UK, which has been in the EU almost the whole period, saw an increase of 98 per cent This suggests, at least, that non membership has not held Norway back ù Switzerland, likewise, is safe, stable and rich And, like Norway, it isnot an EU member The fact is that countries can do very nicely outside the EU What is less clear is how well they can do within it The EU is a lesson in deceit Like joining a cult or a pyramid scheme, the true nature and cost of the abusive system one is entering are hidden until after the ink has dried on the contract; and having joined, one will not be privy to the agenda guiding what one is now paying to support The New York Times puts theunderhand natureof the incremental creation of a European bloc into perspective, almost in passing Looking at Cameron s recent Brussels visit, the paper notes: The departure of Britain from the bloc would throw into reverse for the first time the so called European project, a program of integration that began with six countries with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and that has since expanded to 28 nations, with several others eager to join ù That s right, this entity which tells the Prime Minister of Britain what he can and cannot do began life as a coal and steel agreement In hindsight, it is clear that this 1951 treaty was simply a purchase point needed leverage in what was to follow The agreement itself expired and was abandoned in 2002 and one is left wondering at what undeclared future milestones existing agreements are, in fact, directed The man who in 1973 took the UK into what was then called the European Economic Community or Common Market was Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath In October 2011, Conservative Member of Parliament, Mark Reckless, said during a debate on an EU referendum that Ted Heath had promised the British public that they would have the veto over any important issues ù He continued: Yet those same people are now told that what they were then told was a common market, has become a political union in which we can be outvoted whether we like it or not ù This, then, was a clear case of bait and switch Since his death in 2005, Heath has been implicated in child molestation cases The Guardian reports: An alleged victim, a woman, was interviewed by Clive Driscoll[ ] He retired last year having reached the rank of detective chief inspector Driscolltold the Guardianthe woman he interviewed said she had been abused as a child by a group of people, including Heath on multiple occasions: The person was 100% sure they were talking about Ted Heath She totally believed what she was saying and that s where the investigation starts, not where it stops ù The woman claimed the abuse happened at a time after Heath had served as prime minister Driscoll said others made similar abuse allegations, but he was not asked to take statements from them ù Whether the Establishment willclose rankson this case as it has on that pertaining to EU Commissioner Leon Brittan remains to be seen If the allegations against Heath are true, it is unlikely that such an abhorrent feature of his sexual character surfaced only when he was out of office And that being the case, he would have been entirely controlled by whatever person or agency had the dirt on him while he was Prime Minister My point is this: the history of the development of the EU project bears witness to a clear and pre existing agenda one which has remained hidden from the view of both the public and non senior Members of Parliament And as regards the UK, susceptibility to blackmail by outside forces in the case of the primary actor in the legislative process which resulted in membership must be considered a genuine possibility In the light of the above, the underlying policy behind the EU project increasingly looks like a pre agreed business plan whose KPIs relate solely to implementing that plan while masking the fact of its existence and ensuring compliance at any price In such a case, the rules of realpolitik require that the implementation of policy be seen as responses to external circumstances or to the will of the population Thus, mass non European immigration and the transformation of discrete, largely homogenous white countries into a culturally lost, self loathing wasteland look less like a blunder of some kind and more like an expression of original intent George Soros, a Hungarian Jew who got his first business breaks collaborating with the Nazis the source for which information is his own father s bookMasquerade îDancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary has aplanready for the next stage for Europe This plan begins with accepting 1 million refugees Sputnik News regards thecurrent influxas a social engineering project ùand event engineered at least in part by Soros himself But there is no reason why the EU or the US for that matter should be inherently spastic when it comes to the business of protecting their own boarders; not unless the fix is in from above Israel, for example, does not see armies of migrants converging on its territory That is because Israel is not in the business of tolerating the type of suicidal policies Soros so ardently wishes upon Europe Israel intends to survive And it does so byenforcing its bordersand its racial policy and repelling those who do not fit with that remit So which is it? Can modern states protect their borders or not? I don t mind, so long as we are consistent Is it so unreasonable for the US and the EU to aspire to the type of border controls Israel enjoys? For the record, while I can get behind a true constitutional republic such as America once had, I haveno time for democracywhich I regard as a mechanism designed to simulate choice while facilitating compliance So I am not here to wax lyrical about democracy on my own account What interests me more is the cognitive dissonance those who do believe they have a choice must experience when they see that on any subject which matters the man they are told represents them in this case Cameron is flicked away by EU grandees like so much fluff when he wishes to be seen to try to take an actual decision when the very history of the EU itself implies the pursuit of a covert, non democratic agenda Perhaps an answer is to be found in the words of Aldous Huxley in Brave New World: A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude ù Writer, lecturer and political dissident from the former USSR, Vladimir Bukovsky, delivers a blistering comparison of the europeanunion with the Soviet Union His catalogue of comparisons includes the fact that: The Soviet Union was governed by 15 unelected people, who appointed each other and who were not accountable to anyone The europeanunion is governed by two dozen people, who appoint each other and are not accountable to anyone ù His disturbing and lucid monologue concludes with the words: I have lived in your future, and it didn t work ù @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/326577-eu-ussr-brussels-london/
"13 Nov, 2015",There's something strange in the neighborhood: StratCom East's ghostly targets,"The primary target of StratCom East, a new europeanunion information initiative, and its project Mythbusters, was supposed to be RT Bustin should ve made them feel good! Yet, when it comes to finding fault with the Russian broadcaster s reporting, the EU s Disinformation Review seems to be coming up short In their first report, RT gets two bizarre and unrefuted mentions and in the 2nd, the network isn t cited at all Russian foreign media services are a drop in the ocean compared to their Western competitors There are literally thousands of them across NATO s 28 member nations State funded and their private equivalents Available on TV, in print, on radio and online They are broadcasters, think tanks, bloggers, NGOs and so called citizen journalists Some of them are extremely well paid and others do it voluntarily All of them united in a desire to expose propaganda ù the catch all phrase used to describe anything that contradicts the NATO narrative This dastardly Russian propaganda ùis usually defined as content from RT, Sputnik and if Westernmainstream mediais to believed about 50 online trolls ù Nevertheless, when forced to actually locate some tangible examples of alleged false reportage or disinformation, they can t find very much Of course, all media has lapses and bloopers Especially in a fast paced 24 hour news environment It happens to RT, just as it happens toThe New York Timesand theBBCand many others who on occasion might carry a story that turns out not to be 100 percent accurate The difference, however, is that when RT commits a blooper, it s Russian propaganda ù and replayed for years to come but when American or European outlets bungle, it s a mistake ùeven if it s ever acknowledged, it s forgotten about almost immediately First announced in March, the EU s Mythbusters team is now publishing weekly updates of its disinformation review The introductionpromises to show the European public the high amount of such disinformation attacks that target European audience (sic) every single day ù This presentation turns out to be a six page spreadsheet with lots of blank spaces RT is mentioned twice in Stratcom East s first report With no explanation as to why the mythbusters find either article offensive Indeed, the disproof ùsection, which is supposed to explain what s offensive about the piece, and supply facts instead of presumed fiction, is totally blank In the first article, RTreportedthat the head of Russia s Security Council (Nikolay Patrushev) has warned of a real problem posed by the growing number of US controlled laboratories that produce biological weapons ùYes, RT reports Patrushev s words There is no spin on his comments No opinion whatsoever It s just a normal news story Who, what, where and why Basic journalism Ivana Smolenova, who highlighted the article, has provided no explanation for why it offends her sensibilities Maybe she was having a bad day and didn t like the content? This is the sameMs Smolenovawho works as Communications and Outreach Manager at the Prague Security Studies Institute (PSSI) Of course, the PSSI ispartneredwith the Atlantic Council, RE/RFL, NATO and George Soros opensociety Foundation all big fans of RT The first two mentioned were involved in last week sUS Senate Hearingsabout the network The otherentryconcerns RT s Russian language website Dmytri Spivak, of Kiev s Dragomanov University again leaves the why? ùcolumn blank when drawing attention to a piece about German media As a Kiev resident, it s safe to assume that Mr Spivak can understand Russian Thus, he will have noticed that the article is atranslation, via InoTV, from the Austrian Contra Magazin This is clearly explained in the opening sentence So after all the hype, there are just two RT entries in Stratcom East s first spreadsheet, one of them actually of European origin both with empty disproof columns attached As mentioned, in the 2nd Mythbusters report, RT doesn t feature at all Those funding the exercise must be already looking for their money back How do we know the supposed target is RT? The EU Observersaidso earlier this year Then,PoliticoandThe Guardianboth followed up the story The former reported that the head of the task force ùis Giles Portman, a British career diplomat According to Politico, Portman reports to Michael Mann, the head of the EEAS s strategic communications team who was a spokesman for former high representative Catherine Ashton ù Portman s LinkedInprofilehighlights his role as deputy head of the British Embassy in Turkey for four years: Policy and corporate leadership to UK s network in Turkey of eight posts, 250 staff and 7m budget ùIt wouldn t be surprising if he yearns for those halcyon days Now, he has a staff of an unknown number of media monitors Yet, the public officials and media executives of these countries are so alarmed about Russian news media and RT in particular, that they are crying out in unison about losing the information war ùOn top of beefing up their countries broadcasting budgets, NATO, the UK, and the europeanunion are all creating special initiatives and even military groups to push back on Russian media, ostensibly in the hopes that more of the same ùwill turn out to be the winning formula after all The whole purpose of Stratcom East is difficult to comprehend It smells of a bureaucratic response to a non existent threat Russia, as a single country, has limited resources for foreign media The 28 member NATO zone boasts state funded international broadcasters like Euronews, BBC (in numerous incarnations), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, France 24 and Deutsche Welle This is in addition to NATO sPublic Diplomacy Divisionand the UK S 77th brigade ofinformation warriors, which numbers 1,500 military personnel On top of this, there are hundreds of private media outlets which are loyal to the West s position on Russia, from new media like Buzzfeed and The Daily Beast right down to traditional newspaper and TV giants, distributing content in numerous languages By comparison, Russian news media is actually rather small For example CNN sannual budgetof $750 million is two and a half times larger than that of RT ($300 million), and it s unclear whether that even includes the budget of CNN International, its global broadcasting arm And yet, CNN is only one channel of hundreds parroting the mainstream Western foreign policy narratives In the UK, thepublicly fundedBBC, has around $7 7 billion (to spend in 2015, a good chunk of which goes to news, both domestic and international (please seehereandhereif you d like to get bogged down in the details of BBC s news services related spending) Next year, Russianstate mediawill receive $1 3 billion That s for everything, both domestic and foreign However, the UK press continues to insist that Russian propaganda ùis lavishly funded ùandoverpowering, at home and abroad For comparison, BBCspentmore than this sum around $1 5 billon just to refurbish its news HQ two years ago Clearly, this is not a fair fight The combined Western media outguns Russia by a factor of dozens if not hundreds to one It s the equivalent of the US army taking on the forces of Grenada or Panama Despite their abundance of resources, the Western establishment is constantlyscheming upnew ways to reverse the supposed infowar losses † to Russia Yet with every new strategic communication ùeffort, it becomes apparent that EU s, and the West s messaging problem is neither money nor shortage of special g h o s t b u s t e r s mythbusters initiatives but the trite, tired, and Cold War mired narratives that are still been served to their viewers, readers and listeners Like the one about Russian information threat ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/321848-rt-west-media-propaganda/
"4 Nov, 2015",Soros's ‚ÄòEuropean values‚Äô mean losing your national identity ‚Äì Paul Craig Roberts,"To be part of the europeanunion means you have to shed your national identity and be part of everybody It is no longer acceptable to be yourself This agenda serves the 1 percent and Washington, Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist, told RT in an interview Billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has attracted attention once again, this time saying the europeanunion should take at least a million refugees every year to ease the mass exodus of desperate people from the Middle East and Africa Soros wants the EU to dig deep and pay an annual amount of at least 5,000 per refugee, or 20 billion And this coming at a time of severe austerity measures pushed onto the European people, not to mention the bailout of entire countries, like Greece The Lonely Chancellor: Merkel Under Fire as Refugee Crisis Worsenshttps:// tdotco /ZqV8ScWwzQ Thus, it s little wonder that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says philanthropists like Soros must assume part of the blame for the current crisis This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other hand by those activists who support everything that weakens the nation state, Orban told reporters This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros Soros responded by issuing anemailstatement to Bloomberg Business, †claiming his international organization works to uphold European values ù,while Mr Orban s efforts to fortify the Hungarian border thereby halting a massive wave of illegal migrants undermine those values ù His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle, ùSoros added Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle ù READ MORE: Hungarian PM blames Soros for fueling refugee crisis in Europe Paul Craig Roberts offers his own interpretation as to what has precipitated this crisis of epic proportions as millions of foreigners now descend en masse on European communities, many of which are totally unprepared for the influx of foreigners It is Washington s wars, ùnot George Soros per se, that are forcing the refugees to flee their homelands and seek to enter Europe, Roberts believes Since the Clinton regime, we ve had three two term American presidents who have been at war, ùhe said They have created millions of displaced people and they are now seeking refuge in Europe ù Merkel s stance on#RefugeesCrisis naive, irrational former Czech presidenthttp:// tdotco /8tMFCf8IHNpic twitter com/uvONW5UUIw Roberts also asks whether Soros advice regarding Europe absorbing millions of refugees is based on something other than just humanitarian considerations We have to first ask the question whether Soros progressive causes are real or merely a cover for rule by the 1 percent, ùRoberts said You see, when political boundaries are broken down the result is a power vacuum to which Washington and the 1 percent can move in their pawns ù One consequence of Washington s wars over the course of three presidencies has been to destroy stable countries and leave in their place disorganized, small fiefdoms that war on one another, ùRoberts said What Soros means is: European values means you lost your national identity and you become a hodgepodge of different cultures and different nationalities and your traditional historical existence is dissolved in this pot of diverse peoples ù Migrants & refugees sue Berlin s main refugee center for delays to welfare handoutshttp:// tdotco /uXEPqpEfJOpic twitter com/fbri4tcGHq Roberts applauds Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orban], saying he is exactly correct that this is a threat to the existence of European peoples because they become dissolved in a so called diverse society of different people, different religions, different cultures, different values ù But for those individuals like George Soros who comprise the 1 percent of the global elite, their goal is to redefine what it means to be a European George Soros is in effect saying: We are redefining Europe Europe no longer consists of Hungarians, British, French, Germans and Greeks, etc It now consists of everybody And all of you historical people to be European means you have to be part of everybody You can no longer be yourselves That s the message ù Refugee rhetoric reminiscent of pre Holocaust sentiment UN human rights chiefhttp:// tdotco /BWeB1Qaiohpic twitter com/Bdi98Gp4Zw Yet there is little resistance to the agenda because Europeans have heard the same message repeated so many times they have been brainwashed, ùwhich then makes it easy for their so called leaders to open the borders and accept all of these refugees that Washington s wars have created ù Roberts also makes a dramatic claim, saying that every country that joined the europeanunion has committed an act of national suicide ù It seems to me that of all the leaders of Eastern and Western Europe, the Hungarian prime minister is the only one that has any sense He says: We re not going to commit suicide If Germany wants to commit suicide, fine If they want to follow Merkel into suicide, let them But not us ù Hungary s PM accuses George Soros of undermining European nations on refugeeshttps:// tdotco

 recognized as undesirable before they assume the destructive
 forms that we could observe in Ukraine, Georgia and other
 countries, ù MPs Valery Rashkin and Sergey Obukhov said,

 conducted persistent anti Russian activities for decades and
 that it happened both in Russia and in other countries They said
 that the group was allegedly promoting hatred against Russians in
 Ukraine and also launched some proxy subversive
 operations ù in the Russian Federation In particular, the two MPs blamed George Soros s NGO for the
 destruction of the Russian education system, manifested in the
 much criticized system of single state exams for schoolchildren
 as well as underfinancing of schools and institutes The Law on Undesirable Foreign Groups that came into force
 earlier this week charges the Prosecutor General s Office
 together with the Foreign Ministry with the task of creating an
 official list of undesirable foreign organizations ù and
 outlaw their activities in the country The main criterion for
 putting a foreign or international NGO on the list is the
 threat to the Constitutional order and the defense capability or
 security of the Russian State ù Once the group is recognized as undesirable all its assets in
 Russia must be frozen, offices closed and distribution of any of
 its information materials must be banned Violating the bill is
 punished with heavy fines both for the personnel of the banned
 organizations and Russian citizens who cooperate with them A
 repeat offense can carry up to six years in prison From the moment it was drafted, the new law was sharply
 criticized by the Russian rights community, foreign NGOs and
 officials The europeanunion and the United States have
 officially expressed their concern over it and warned that the
 move banning cooperation with various foreign groups could bring
 about the isolation of the Russian people from the outside world The two opposition MPs who originally drafted the bill have
 described it as a preventive measure and denied that it was
 targeting any specific foreign organizations The opensociety Institute, also known as the Soros Foundation

 in Russia since 1995 and financed many projects in the

 independence And we also know that the US has their largest

 suspending plans for an association agreement with the European

 /files/opinionpost/37/c1/b0/00/2530092_obana_new mp4 As if on command, thousands of Ukrainians suddenly poured into
 the streets of Kiev to protest the decision Such a rapid
 reaction should not have come as a surprise After all, a
 multitude of US government agencies most notably, USAID had
 been operating in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
 investing billions on its latest democratic pet
 project This is no conspiracy theory On December 13, 2013, Assistant
 Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, following her third trip to
 Ukraine in five weeks, told the National Press Club: Since
 Ukraine s independence in 1991 the United States has invested
 over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in needs and other goals Exactly what those other goals may have been, and who
 helped underwrite them, seem rather obvious today Although many are tempted to believe otherwise, governments don t
 normally spend such prodigious sums of money in a foreign land
 unless it expects to get something hefty in this case, Kiev s
 loyalty in return Governments are by nature political
 opportunists, not philanthropists, which is precisely why Russia
 gave USAID the boot in 2012 Ukraine did not, and was forced to
 pay the piper, so to speak We should note here that it was not just US taxpayer dollars that
 unwittingly provided the funds to support the coup d etat in
 Ukraine In another softball interview with CNN s Zakaria,
 billionaireGeorge Soroslast May coolly admitted: I
 set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent
 of Russia And the foundation has been functioning ever since and
 played an important part in events now ù Certainly those billions of dollars weren t spent just on
 humanitarian work, like distributing pastries to the Ukrainian
 rabble gathered on Independence Square After all, the crucial
 question as to who would lend Ukraine a multi billion dollar
 rescue package was the elephant parked on Maidan that few talked
 about Once upon a time, western financial institutions had the
 market cornered on the lucrative task of bailing out
 cash strapped countries Today, however, other economic agencies
 BRICS for example are able to compete with the IMF But after
 Kiev exploded in chaos and violence, the regular lender of last
 resort bagged itself another national trophy for above its
 fireplace Michael Hudson, of Counterpunch,summed upthe IMF victory: In April
 2014, fresh from riots in Maidan Square and the February 22 coup,
 and less than a month before the May 2 massacre in Odessa, the
 IMF approved a $17 billion loan program to Ukraine s junta 
 Normal IMF practice is to lend only up to twice a country s quote
 in one year This was eight times as high Hudson said the loan,
 given at a time of civil war, proved that the Washington based
 financial institution functions as an arm of US Cold War
 politics Kiev used the loan for military expenses to attack the
 Eastern provinces, and the loan terms imposed the usual budget
 austerity, as if this would stabilize the country s
 finances For anybody who still believes those billions of dollars were
 spent just to prop up democratic institutions need only consider
 the harsh historical lessons from places as diverse and distant
 as South America and the Middle East Time and again, from Chile
 to Iran, Washington propped up puppet dictatorships to serve its
 purpose Proving this charge is as simple as eavesdropping on a telephone
 call conversation between Nuland and the US Ambassador to
 Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt Almost one year ago to the day, Nuland was heard outlining
 Washington s vision of Kiev s future democratic structure Nothing terribly ironic about that, right? While much
 of the amused media focused its attention on Nuland s F*ck
 the EU ùverbal bomb, that was mere child s play compared to
 the meat of the conversation, which spelled out exactly who
 Washington wanted in power in Kiev Nuland: I don t think Klitsch
 [Vitaly Klitschko, one of the opposition leaders] should go into
 the government I don t think it s necessary, I don t think it s
 a good idea Pyatt:Yeah I guess in terms of
 him not going into the government, just let him stay out and do
 his political homework and stuff Nuland:I think Yats

 Ukraine]is the
 guy who s got the economic experience, the governing experience 
 He s the what he needs is Klitsch and Tyagnibok [Oleg
 Tyagnibok, the other opposition leader] on the outside He needs
 to be talking to them four times a week, you know I just think
 Klitsch going in he s going to be at that level working for
 Yatseniuk, it s just not going to work Pyatt:Yeah, no, I think that s
 right OK Good Do you want us to set up a call with him as the
 next step? Or, instead of enduring the obscenities of a Nuland conversation,
 one could simply wait for Barack Obama to sum it all up in an
 interview with CNN all star softball pitcher Fareed Zakaria Instead of challenging Obama on the question as to whether
 US NATO policies in Eastern Europe which, aside from moving
 inexorably eastward to Russia s border, also excludes Russian
 participation in the US missile defense shield have in some
 substantial way contributed to the deterioration of relations
 between Russia and the US, Zakaria merely dangles the Russian aggressor ùcarrot before Obama, who of course
 blames the entire mess on Putin, while admitting to something
 incredible, yet entirely believable READ MORE: US envoy to Ukraine caught posting
 fake images on Twitter Obama told CNN s Zakaria that Washington had brokered a deal

 everything we needed to know about Ukraine s so called democratic
 transition, it s a completely different thing when the deal ùis admitted to by none other than the American
 president Washington power brokers, desensitized to the concept of
 brokering political deals ùdue to their so called
 democratic work in faraway war zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
 Libya, think it normal operating procedure to employ the strategy
 inside of sovereign states that are experiencing internal
 discord The real tragedy of such a scenario is not so much that it is
 happening, but that the United States, and the Ukrainian people,
 it seems, believe that a foreign invasion of political
 opportunists on their territory constitutes democracy or will
 somehow lead to democracy I d wager to bet that Ukraine will
 very soon resemble Greece, where the people had firsthand
 experience with foreign enforced austerity measures and,
 employing real democratic procedure as opposed to backroom
 brokered deals, introduced real democracy to elect politicians of
 the people, for the people and by the people But then again, the United States expected no less from the $5

 Russia is a loser Here you have Russia subsidizing the countries
 that are imposing sanctions on it, trying to destroy Russia RT:Some experts say that Russia is a winner
 in this situation? Do you agree with that? Is this a good price
 for gas? PR:Why is a hundred dollars below the market
 price a good price? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
 Russia will ever be paid If they are not going to be paid, what
 are they going to do? They are going to cut off the gas in the
 middle of the winter so that Washington propaganda can say: Look at these evil Russians, they are starving, freezing
 Ukrainians, the gas is cut off! ùI don t think Russians
 understand what they are dealing with Washington is far more
 devious and sophisticated then Russia can comprehend This is not
 that Russia has a chance Alexander Mercouris, international legal expert, on the latest
 EU Russia Ukraine gas agreement: Ukraine is broken largely
 because the EU broke it through the policies it has followed
 over the last year, and now Europe has to pay for that I don t
 think financially they are very happy about it, but
 realistically, what choice did they have ù RT:But it is not Ukraine that is going to
 pay this money to Russia The EU and IMF have said they re ready
 to finance Kiev s debt to Russia But the Ukrainian economy is in
 tatters Can they expect to get the money back? PR:If the IMF pays the Ukrainian bills it takes
 it back out of Ukraine This is not a gift to Ukraine If the
 Ukrainian economy blows up which is likely to be the case the
 IMF sees it is not going to be paid because Ukraine can t pay 
 Russians won t be paying RT:Russia is having economic problems of
 its own Is this agreement a positive step for Moscow too? PR:I think Moscow ends up at risk with this
 agreement Washington is very interested in doing all the damage
 it possibly can to Russia because Russia is a potential check on
 Washington s hegemony over the world So for all the prices
 falling is good as far as Washington is concerned I think it is
 foolish for the Russians to let their currency be traded at
 foreign exchange markets because Washington can attack the ruble
 and the exchange markets and drive it down Just as George Soros
 did One person was able to destroy the British pound Washington
 can easily destroy the ruble I still don t think Russians
 understand what they are up against; they are not really in the
 game Vladimir Putin is a good leader and he gives good speeches,
 but he doesn t seem to be able to prevent the continuing assaults
 on Russia Despite giving Ukraine a subsidized gas price, despite
 Russia guaranteeing energy supplies to Europe in the winter,
 there is no reduction in sanctions, there is no stop in the
 propaganda against Russia In fact the propaganda has increased
 because Washington is afraid that Russia might gain some
 advantage from treating Ukraine in such a kind way What is
 Russia gaining out of this? It is not getting anything Here is
 Russia with a power to turn energy off in Europe It doesn t use
 it, it doesn t say to these countries in Europe: Look, if
 you are going to put sanctions on us, if you are not going to
 have an independent foreign policy, if you are going to follow
 Washington s orders we don t sell gas to NATO members ù ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/201135-gas-ukraine-russia-eu-price/

 September 14, signaled the return of a left leaning government
 after eight years in opposition The change of government in
 Sweden also means an end of the mandate of one of the well known
 lawmakers in the European political arena Foreign Minister Carl
 Bildt Bildt has been a fierce critic of Russia over its politics
 in Ukraine RT:Bildt was one of the people behind the
 Eastern partnership the initiative governing the EU s relations
 with post soviet states Some argue, this policy is partly to
 blame for the current chaos in Ukraine, would you agree? Bryan MacDonald:It definitely played a large
 part, but it wouldn t exclusively have led to this of course 
 There are other factors such as Ukrainian internal politics,
 movements and of course interference of the US, NATO and
 non government bodies such as George Soros and Pierre Omidyar 
 But certainly the Eastern Partnership is one of the bulwarks, and
 of course Carl Bildt was one of the main supporters of it A
 partnership that has completely transformed the EU from a core
 group of 15 relatively rich West European countries to a group of
 27 where most of the group are poor RT:He served on the Board of Directors of
 Lundin Oil, during the Civil war in Sudan The company was
 accused of providing resources to government forces that
 committed crimes against humanity How did that affect his
 reputation in Sweden? BM:I don t think people in Europe are really
 aware of that I think Bildt in Europe was mainly famous for his
 behavior in the Balkans and Ukraine this year, and his general
 support of what we call eurocratic ùpolitics, which is
 where the elite within Europe, every country almost, with a few
 exceptions of course, seem to care more about the European
 project then the actual people who live in Europe at the moment 
 That is one of the reasons he has been in the news here, I don t
 think Sudan is such a big issue in Europe itself amongst the
 normal voting public RT:Bildt worked with the Committee for the
 liberation of Iraq pushing for the invasion of the country How
 big of a role did the organization play in the conflict? BM:Again, like with the Ukraine situation, it s
 one of many groups that played a role in conflict Obviously the
 biggest role in the conflict was played by George Bush and Tony
 Blair by their bombing of Iraq Of course it played a role and
 Bildt is a notorious neo con, but the real question here is that
 Bildt is a slavish supporter of what we call American values
 which are not necessarily in train with what we call European
 values Most Europeans, not all, but especially countries like
 France, in the Nordic countries and Ireland, would be suspicious
 of America s actions and would have a very different world view

 government mismanagement on a truly grand scale? Or are we seeing
 global power elite long term planners slowly achieving their
 goals? Recurrent sovereign debt crises reflect neither over lending
 mistakes ùby bankers and investors, nor innocence ùon the part of successive governments in deeply indebted nations Rather, it all ties in with a global model for domination driven
 by a system of perpetual national debt which Ihave called The Shylock Model ù As with the tango which requires rhythm and bravado, Argentina is
 again dancing centre stage to global mega bankers financial
 tunes after falling into a new technical default ù Not
 just because the country is unable to pay off its massive public
 debt by heeding the rules of the game ùas written and
 continuously re vamped by global usurers, but now with added
 legal immorality and judicial indecency on the part of New York s
 Second District Manhattan Court presided by Judge Daniel Griesa Griesa has shown no qualms in putting US law at the service of
 immoral parasitic bankers and investors ùsuch as Paul
 Singer of the Elliott/NML Fund and Mark Brodsky of the Aurelius
 Fund The mainstream media inside and outside Argentina refer to these
 parasitic money sloshers ùas vulture funds ù;
 a conceptual mistake because one might then be led to believe
 that other funds and bankers Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citigroup,
 JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, George Soros, Rothschild, Warburg
 are not vultures ùwhen, in fact, the very foundations
 of today s global banking system lie on parasitic pro vulture
 rules and laws coupled with an overpowering lack of moral values Sovereign debts are a major problem in just about every country
 in the world, including the US, UK and EU nations So much so,
 those debts have become a Damocles Swords threatening the
 livelihood of untold billions of workers around the world One often wonders why governments indebt themselves for so much
 more than they can ever hope to pay Here, Western economists,
 bankers, traders, Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel
 laureates and the mainstream media have a quick and monolithic
 reply: because all nations need investment and
 investors ùif they wish to build highways, power plants,
 schools, airports, hospitals, raise armies, service
 infrastructures and a long list of et ceteras, economic and
 national activities are all about But more and more people are starting to ask a fundamental
 common sense question: why should governments indebt themselves
 in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
 mega bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
 and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their
 own local sovereign currency instead? Here is where all the above experts ùgo berserk &
 ballistic, shouting back: Issue currency? Are you crazy??
 That s against the rules & laws ù of economics!!! Issuing
 national sovereign currency to finance the real economy s
 monetary needs leads to inflation and lost jobs and chaos and 
 (puts us nice mega bankers out of a job )!! ùThat s when
 they all gang up into noisy The sky is falling! The sky is
 falling!! ùmode Then you ask them: What happens when countries default on their
 unpayable sovereign debts as they invariably and repeatedly do
 not just in Argentina, but in Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, France,
 Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Portugal, Russia, Bolivia,
 Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and
 Indonesia? Again the voice of the experts ù: Then countries
 must restructure ù their debts kicking them forwards 20, 40 or
 more years into the future, so that your great, great, great
 grandchildren can continue paying them ù Oh, I see! The truth is that countries need public spending to maintain
 their economies resilient and buoyant, their citizens working,
 prospering and happy; their nation states sovereign, strong and
 secure OK: happy, secure and working populations cannot be defined as a
 formula that can be readily integrated into expert ùeconomists spreadsheets However, there s a basic truth that
 should be obvious by now: Finance (which is the virtual world of
 bankers, investments, speculation and usury) should always be
 fully subordinated to the Real Economy (which is the world of
 work, production, buildings, milk & bread and services) All this begs the obvious question: Since governments have a
 natural tendency to overspend and end up getting themselves into
 too much debt, which is the better option then: that their red numbers ù(aka sovereign debt) should
 be owed to themselves; their own nation states (debt in local
 currency that in the last instance can be written off, even if a
 bad bout of inflation cannot be stopped, countries can always
 revamp their currencies as Argentina repeatedly did over the past
 forty years), whereby the whole debt crisis ùbasically
 becomes a short term internal affair (albeit painful!), or to convert those red numbers ùinto foreign currency
 debt (US Dollars or Euro) fully controlled by powerful far away,
 well organized creditor technocrats and global mega bankers
 sitting at the FED and IMF in Washington DC; the European Central
 Bank in Frankfurt; or perched in eager expectation in their Wall
 Street vulture nests? This tongue twister, which famously proved too much for Baby Bush
 to muster, is a fitting description of how the hellish sovereign
 debt system really works in the long term Argentina s recurrent defaults and debt restructuring go back
 many decades For brevity s sake, let s just point to 1956 right
 after President Juan Domingo Per√≥n was ousted by a very bloody
 1955 US UK (and mega banker) sponsored military coup Per√≥n was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina
 with the mega bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all
 of Argentina s sovereign debt So, once the mega bankers got rid
 of him in 1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created
 the Paris Club ùto engineer decades worth of sovereign
 debt for vanquished Argentina, something they ve been doing until
 today But each sovereign debt crisis cycle became shorter, more
 virulent and more toxic By December 2001, Argentina had collapsed financially sinking
 into the largest sovereign debt default in history Immediately,
 the IMF s deputy manager Anne Krueger proposed some new and
 creative ideas ùon what to do about Argentina She published them in 2002 in an article on the IMF s website: Should Countries like Argentina be able to declare
 themselves bankrupt? ù, in which she said that the
 lesson is clear: we need better incentives to bring debtors and
 creditors together before manageable problems turn into
 full blown crises ù, adding that the IMF believes this
 could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy regimes like
 Chapter 11 in the US ù She pointed this out as a possible new approach ù,
 adding that of course many practical and political obstacles
 to getting such an approach up and running ùneeded to be
 overcome, the key features would need the force of law
 throughout the world ù, creating a predictable (global)
 legal framework ù From the stance of global mega bankers geopolitical long term
 planners, Ms Krueger s proposal consisted of first gradually
 driving countries into receivership, and then sequentially into
 full fledged bankruptcy Then as if nations were private corporations like Enron or
 WorldCom they could be broken up into as many digestible ùpieces as possible, to be gobbled up by
 international creditors in some global vulture fest banquet These ideas were developed in greater detail in her IMF essay, A New Approach to Debt Restructuring ù, and in a Foreign Affairs ù(mouthpiece of the powerful New
 York Based Elite think tank, Council on Foreign Relations)
 article published in July/August 2002 by Harvard professor
 Richard N Cooper: Chapter 11 for Countries ù Here, Cooper very matter of factly recommends that only if
 the debtor nation cannot restore its financial health are its
 assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed to its creditors 
 again under the guidance of a (global) court ù(!) During those turbulent years, the global press Time and The New
 York Times, for example even suggested that the immensely rich
 Patagonia southern region should secede from Argentina as a
 defaulted debt payment mechanism In June 2005, however, a new sovereign debt bond mega swap was
 instrumented by Argentina s new president, Nestor Kirchner, and
 his Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna However, as Argentina became more and more structurally mired in
 debt, its sovereign debt crisis cycle grew shorter and shorter so
 that by 2010 a new debt crisis was in the books involving yet
 more debt reengineering, this time by President Cristina Kirchner
 and her Economy Minister (and today prosecuted Vice President)
 Amado Boudou But that too failed to hold for long, and today Singer s
 NML/Elliot Fund and Brodsky s Aurelius Fund have pushed Argentina
 again into default, this time with the legal backing of local
 Manhattan Federal Judge Griesa and the US Supreme Court The very fact that today the fate of Argentina s sovereign debt
 lies with the US Judiciary is an eloquent sign of things to come Surprisingly, Ms Krueger recently came out in defense ùof Argentina recommending Judge Griesa and his Vulture
 Nest ùboys should not act hastily killing off the Argentine
 hen that lays golden eggs In an article published July 2014, she warns that the US
 Supreme Court s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle, and may
 very well further increase the risk attached to holding sovereign
 debt and this, to the cost of issuing it ù The specialized and mainstream media Financial Times, New York
 Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist are also recommending
 Judge Griesa and his vulture chicks to show more restraint
 because in today s delicate post 2008 banking system, a new and
 less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart the global
 elite s plans for an orderly transition towards a new global
 legal architecture ùthat will allow orderly liquidation of
 financially failed states like Argentina Especially if such debt
 were to be collateralized by its national territory (what else is
 left!?) Will yet another sovereign debt bond mega swap be imposed upon
 Argentina, this time with large swathes of its national territory
 especially Patagonia being used as collateral guarantee? That would mean that in a few years time the Shylocks in Wall
 Street and London will do everything they can to yet again push
 Argentina into default, since that would pave the way for them to legally ùtake over its territory cashing in on their
 collateral as compensation ù Remember: usurer Shylock drooled at the mouth whilst sharpening
 his knife preparing to cut deep into Merchant Antonio s heart He
 didn t give a damn about the 3000 ducats owed him: he just wanted
 the pound of flesh legally ùhis Is this what the coming Sovereign Debt Model ùwill look
 like? If we tie this all in with what the unfolding of Act
 III ùin the on goingIsrael Palestine crisiswhereby re settling
 millions of Israeli civilians into southern Argentina might be on
 the drawing board, we can then begin to understand how nicely
 Argentina s next debt crisis will tie in: The global
 Rothschild s, Warburg s, Lazard s, Soros, Rockefellers will be
 able to legally ùtake over Patagonia, and then legally ùhand it over to whomever they wish without a
 single shot being fired! If this is what s really happening behind the curtains regarding
 Argentina, does anybody believe it will stop there? Beware Greece, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Korea,
 Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa the world government is
 marching in!

"7 Jul, 2014",IMF pushes Ukraine to ‚Äòvoluntarily commit suicide‚Äô,"Western support will allow more IMF and European lending to prop the Ukrainian currency so the Ukrainian oligarchs can move their money safely to British and US banks, economist and author Michael Hudson told RT s Truthseeker RT:Could you
 summarize for us the tried and tested steps that will lead from
 IMF loans, to Ukraine s best assets ending up in private Western
 hands the IMF s knee breaker role as you memorably described
 it as? Michael Hudson:The basic principle to bear in
 mind is that finance today is war by non military means The aim
 of getting a country in debt is to obtain its economic surplus,
 ending up with its property The main property to obtain is that
 which can produce exports and generate foreign exchange For
 Ukraine, this means mainly the Eastern manufacturing and mining
 companies, which presently are held in the hands of the
 oligarchs For foreign investors, the problem is how to transfer
 these assets and their revenue into foreign hands in an economy
 whose international payments are in chronic deficit as a result
 of the failed post 1991 restructuring That is where the IMF
 comes in The IMF was not set up to finance domestic government budget
 deficits Its loans are earmarked to pay foreign creditors,
 mainly to maintain a country s exchange rate The effect usually
 is to subsidize flight capital out of the country at a high
 exchange rate rather than depositors and creditors getting fewer
 dollars or euro In Ukraine s case, foreign creditors would
 include Gazprom, which already has been paid something The IMF
 transfers a credit to its Ukraine account, ùwhich then
 pays foreign creditors The money never really gets to Ukraine or
 to other IMF borrowers It is paid to the accounts of foreigners,
 including foreign government creditors, as in IMF loans to
 Greece Such loans come with conditionalities ùthat
 impose austerity This in turn drives the economy even further
 into debt forcing the government to tighten the budget even
 more, run even smaller budget deficits and sell off public
 assets RT:Can Ukraine expect the so called IMF
 effect of 1 in 5 of the impoverished population emigrating
 to work abroad, and what consequence could this have on a country
 to lose its brightest minds? MH:Ukraine already draws in foreign emigrants 
 remittances equal to about 4% of its GDP (About $10 billion a
 year ) Most of this money comes from Russia, the rest from
 Western Europe The effect of IMF austerity plans is to drive
 more Ukrainians to emigrate in search of work They will send
 some of their earnings back to their families, strengthening the
 Ukrainian currency vis √† vis the ruble and euro RT:How are the IMF s tools in reality
 weapons of mass destruction ù as youquotedit? MH:Lower budget deficits cause even deeper
 austerity and unemployment The result is a downward economic
 spiral Lower incomes mean lower tax revenues So governments are
 told to balance their budgets by selling off public assets 
 mainly natural monopolies whose buyers can raise excess prices to
 extract economic rent The effect is to turn the economy into a
 renting tollbooth economy ùHitherto free public roads
 are turned into toll roads, and other transportation, water and
 sewer systems also are privatized This raises the cost of
 living, and hence the cost of labor while overall wage levels
 are squeezed by the financial austerity that shrinks markets and
 raises unemployment RT:The IMF s perhaps also a weapon of mass
 destruction in a more literal sense The organization has
 publicly threatened and blackmailed Ukraine that it will
 re design its aid package, unless Kiev goes to war on fellow
 Ukrainians in the East of the country and stops them protesting 
 Does that not make it now literally a criminal accomplice or
 instigator of war andmurder? MH:The IMF s conditionality ùis that
 it pacify ùthe East Pacification may occur violently
 in today s Orwellian rhetoric The only way in which actual
 political and economic peace can be achieved is by a loose
 federalization of Ukraine, to make each region independent of the
 kleptocrats in Kiev, who are appointed mainly from the West As for accusations of criminality, this always depends on who is
 the prosecutor, and what is the court! No country has yet
 prosecuted the IMF All that voters can do is reject governments
 submitting to IMF conditionalities Many voters who are able will vote with their feet ùand simply leave the sinking
 economy So the IMF s defense is that Ukraine and other clients
 are voluntarily committing suicide rather than being murdered 
 Austerity is ultimately a policy nobody is holding gun to their
 head, except when political leaders are assassinated as in Chile
 in 1974 under Pinochet with the US Government behind it In this
 sense, Ukraine today is a replay of Chile four decades ago RT:Everyone knows austerity s effects on
 Greece and elsewhere; polls show most Ukrainians don t want it;
 even the IMF itself now admits austerity doesn t work Why will
 Ukraine s leaders allow it to happen, are they guaranteed a cushy
 job in the West when they ve voted out or something? MH:Ukraine s leaders are mainly kleptocrats 
 Their aim is not to help the country, but to help consolidate
 their own power George Soros has written that their best way to
 do this is to find Western partners This will provide US and
 European backing for the kleptocrats tightening their hold on the
 economy Western support will provide more IMF and European
 lending to support the currency so that the Ukrainian oligarchs
 can move their money safely to the West, to British banks and US
 banks RT:Do you think that the EU isn t stupid
 enough to make Ukraine a full member, so under the one sided
 association agreement, member states will just strip the country
 of its best assets, and use its workers as near slave labor, with
 Ukraine s 91 US cents an hour minimum wage? MH:The EU hardly can really make Ukraine a
 member One reason is that a key policy underlying French and
 German creation of the original Common Market in 1957 was the
 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Ukraine has rich Western land,
 and that part of the country is largely still rural Foreign
 investors would like to buy it out and re feudalize ùit, creating large business farms But the EU is unlikely to
 provide the subsidies that financed mechanization and capital
 investment in Western European agriculture The EU does not need to formally integrate with Ukraine to
 benefit from its inexpensive labor Wrecking the economy
 Greek style or Irish style or Latvian style is sufficient to send
 its workers to the West And the most mobile traditionally are
 the best educated youth in their 20s, able to speak foreign
 languages and with skills in demand in the West RT:You noted Ukraine must have asked the
 US first before blowing up that gas pipeline Do you think NATO
 will support anything even terrorism to make Russian gas seem
 less reliable, especially while US fracking giants currently are
 waging a big PR campaign in Europe MH:The US has pressed Europe to make its own
 economy much more high cost and to rely on US gas exports mainly
 in order to deprive Russia of foreign exchange The NATO
 rationale is essentially that which Prime Minister Arseniy
 Yatsenyuk tweeted on Monday, June 16: Ukraine won t continue
 subsidizing Gazprom [to the tune of] $5 billion annually, so that
 Russia can arm itself against us [with this money] ù The US position today is what it was in 1991: Without
 manufacturing, Russia cannot be a serious military power to
 defend itself And without purchasing foreign technology and
 without large state subsidy as US and European governments
 provide their own economies Russia cannot create a
 manufacturing economy So NATO is trying to prevent Russia from
 earning enough money to modernize its economy, on the principle
 that any industrial power is potentially military, and any
 military power my potentially be used to achieve political
 independence from the US sphere RT:Anything else you would like to
 add? MH:What is at issue is whether economies
 throughout the world will let financial leverage dismantle the
 power of elected governments, and hence of democracy Governments
 are sovereign No government actually needs to pay foreign debts
 or submit to policies that negate the three definitions of a
 state: to create its own money, to levy taxes, and to declare
 war At issue is who shall rule the world: the emerging 1% as a
 financial oligarchy, or elected governments The two sets of aims
 are antithetical: rising living standards and national
 independence, or a renting economy, austerity and international
 dependency The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/170960-economy-imf-ukraine-oligarchs/
"20 Jun, 2014",Intl Energy Forum head - EU's energy independence dreams won't be realized anytime soon,"Ukraine is refusing to pay its energy bills, and Moscow turns off the taps there is now a real concern another gas war is going on, and it may get out of hand The game for energy has too many players locked in it Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and the US but who will suffer the consequences if things go wrong and the agreement is not reached? Can shale gas save the day? We ask these questions to the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum Aldo Flores Quiroga is on Sophie&Co today Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Aldo Flores Quiroga, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, welcome to the show It s great to have you with us I m going to start from the latest: Europe wants energy independence what do you think, can it ever achieve that goal when it has no significant natural energy reserves of its own? Is it something doable? Aldo Flores Quiroga:Energy independence as a concept on its own is a very weak concept for pursuing energy policy No country is energy independent, and it s very unlikely that anyone can achieve that The world of energy is one of interdependence, it s a message we constantly emphasize in the context of producer consumer dialog conducted under the IEF SS:You know how Europe is dependent on Russian gas it seems something of a clich√© Is it really Russia or the transit countries that is causing the problems? I mean, Russia is a reliable supplier; it has never halted the flow of gas to Europe It only had to reroute the gas when Ukraine would stop the transit AFQ:Look, this goes beyond whether countries are causing or not problems The structure of long term, safe, reliable trade between countries requires a commitment of many players In the energy dialogue we have learned that security of demand is as important as security of supply And what we re seeing now in the context of Russian European trade and Ukraine as a transit country is a responsible behavior from all sides There s conversation going on, which is the right approach when there is a divergence of views, and we welcome this very much Of course issue is not simple, but to the extent that the interested parties are participating in this dialog, it should be welcomed by everyone SS::OK, but now we have a special situation on our hands There is a civil war going on in Ukraine Russia is Europe s biggest gas supplier Now half of the gas flow to Europe is passing through Ukraine Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? AFQ:Is it safe for Europe s supply right now? SS:Yeah, because, you know, it s an unusual situation right now in Ukraine It s beyond just being a safe supplier or safe transit route, there is a civil war going on in the country AFQ:Again, the fundamental component of any country s energy policy involves diversification Suppliers and demanders, producers and consumers always have to have diversification as one of the objectives of energy policy if they want to enhance the energy security The fact that European countries have pursued a policy of diversification, the fact that Russia itself is pursuing a policy of diversification, both of energy sources and of markets: it s just a sensible policy regardless of the circumstances SS:But if we talk in terms of today, not in one year or two or three years, but, like, today the way things are looking right now, remembering 2006 and 2009 Ukraine was late with its gas payments and intercepted Europe bound Russian gas Could that happen again right now? AFQ:The first thing to keep in mind is that we re in a different world right now from 2009 Europe has made investments in diversification, Russia has also approached this with a mindset of diversification, investments that it has done to go with Europe now are looking towards markets in the East, and there is also a stronger political infrastructure, to call it somehow, to address this issue, so we re not exactly facing the same situation And investments in diversification involved not only the inter connectedness in Europe, but new markets Europe is set to increase its energy imports, as we have also seen Russia, as I have said, is looking for markets elsewhere and this should strengthen the energy security for all interested parties SS:OK, but talking of diversification, you would think that the South Stream pipeline project would have taken care of many things it would be so beneficial to Europe; but then you see Bulgaria all of a sudden halting its construction What do you think happened there? What went wrong? AFQ:As usual in this cases, it is never simple to bring all the various interests to coincide That s why investments in gas are long term usually they take a sometimes protracted negotiation process, and what we re seeing is precisely that It s not necessarily easy to bring this many countries and companies to agree on what is a best approach to these very sizeable investments SS:Look, I m not insinuating anything AFQ:Now, that said, it is of course important that there s a responsible behavior from all sides, producers consumers and transit countries, and, well, the fact that there are complications, does not imply that there is an irresponsible behavior per se There are just various points of view that have to be made compatible in the process of these negotiations SS:And every country has the right to decide on its own whether they want to be part of a pipeline project, or not But if Russian gas was no longer available, what alternatives are there? For example, Norway s Statoil announced it could increase gas supplies to the europeanunion , but it just wouldn t be enough in terms of quantity to make up for all of the Russian gas So, what are the alternatives as of today? AFQ:First of all, I would not start from that premise I don t think that the Russian gas will not be available Second, let s keep in mind that gas consumption as such of total energy consumption in Europe is 5 percent This means that Europe is diversified and has options, and together with new measures that are being taken in Europe, approaches to diversify like I have said their energy needs and their sources of gas supply, I don t see a scenario of any major disruption and I do see that Europe has many options on the table to deal with any situation Europe has a diversified energy system, even taking into account that Russia is such an important gas supplier to Europe SS:And can the US make up any shortfall in energy supplies for Europe? AFQ:Well, that s a question that everyone is asking, what s going to be the impact of the unconventionals revolution ù as it is now called, the rise of production of gas in the US, of oil and gas in the rest of the world, and gas markets in general We have yet to see many other developments unfold before we can say with any certainty how it s going to happen Right now, the main project is for LNG export in the US from the Gulf coast It appears to be dedicated to supply both Asia and Europe, but it is just one of many projects, it may not have the size right now for anyone to suggest that this will make up for shortfalls in the supply Again, this is a much more complex subject with many players, with many suppliers What is clear, of course, is that to the extent that exports from the US to Europe or from any other country for that matter to Europe are sustained or increased, this will also enhance the energy security in Europe SS:I remember European Commission president Jos√© Manuel Barroso saying that the EU can t create the illusion that gas from the US is going to solve all of its problems, and there are so many different estimates of how much it could take, but in your personal opinion what s your estimate? How much time does the US need to put their shale gas export into action? AFQ:Now, that s quite speculative We know that there is one project approved in the US, and there are many more on different levels of probability being explored, so it is unclear And moreover, the US is increasing its own demand for its own gas, so it is too soon to tell, in my view SS:But you know how people like to speculate, and when we announced that we re having you on our program, it was going to be about gas, there is this viewer of ours who sent us this question he is asking, is there any weight to the idea that this Russian Ukraine gas conflict is being stirred up by the US, and it is to force Europe to switch suppliers? AFQ:Well that s just pure speculation I certainly don t agree with that point of view Let me insist, there are serious issues with serious players and actors and governments and companies The idea that with the amount of resources involved, the size of investments that are behind the oil and gas industry, and the very important relationships between states that this type of simplistic mindset would be used anyway, it s just hard to imagine SS:I do want to continue talking about this whole shale gas revolution, because Europe and Ukraine have shale gas reserves, and they are untapped Now, is the crisis situation going to advance their development what do you think? AFQ:Well, we have seen that any disruption to energy flows does increase attention to policies of diversification, and fracking, the possibility of using hydraulic fracking to increase oil and gas production in Europe is therefore now with more emphasis on the table, and well, it s part of the search for energy security It is indeed one of the components of diversification, it s not the only one, but, currently, given the issues that we have now seen, with respect to gas trade between Russia and Europe well it becomes more interesting to see what can be done with oil and gas SS:Well you certainly know much more about fracking than I do So how safe a technology is it? Because, we do see a lot of anti fracking protests worldwide, like Bulgaria and France have rejected shale gas due to the harm it poses to the environment What do you think of it? AFQ:We have seen so far practices that seem to be compatible with environmental protection There have been experiences that have not been positive, that are under study, that have been addressed so far So, it seems from what we know up to this point that production from shale resources is safe enough So far, without any instance of major disaster for the environment or major issues socially, the industry seems to be progressing well, but of course everyone should be vigilant and every effort should be made that no harm to the environment and to other civic and societal concerns is made SS:What about, like, minor disasters, not major, but minor disasters are they OK? Is it worth the big idea? AFQ:Well, no disaster is fine, right? None of that should be acceptable The industry, and of course the governments should make sure that this production is done in the safest way possible, that no serious affectation is made So, whatever type of accidents or concerns that have happened, both with production of shale, and production of unconventionals, or any other resource has to be addressed SS:I ve been reading up on this a little bit, and there is in Britain, in Romania and even in US locals report seismic activity in their neighborhoods, and they say their tap water catches fire I mean, that s seems crazy, and there s this issue of water pollution with the chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing Is this serious, is this big? AFQ:The evidence is not strong in that regard We have seen claims about earthquakes associated with fracking, about water contamination Interestingly, some of the concerns have been voiced also do involve the environment per se, but the level of traffic that is associated with the moving back and forth of trucks that are participating or are part of fracking process But, the evidence, again, so far, is not strong to suggest that the environmental effects of fracking are adverse SS:I want to get back to our part of the world, because this is what worries us the most Now, the price Ukraine pays for Russian gas is $485 per 1,000 cubic meters I just want your expert opinion, leaving the politics aside it wants to pay half the price, is that a fair request? AFQ:This is a commercial decision between supplier and consumer What is, I think, clear to everyone, is that the supply bringing gas and oil to market is costly, and no one can reasonably expect that production should not be compensated Likewise, it s not wise, from the producer side to think that taking measures that will affect consumers will be in anyone s interest certainly not for the long term So, a solution must be found that is fair to the producer and the consumer in this case What we are seeing is a process for finding that solution, and I m confident that it will be found SS:What would you advise, because Ukraine is unwilling to pay for gas, Russia is unwilling to budge what would your expect advice be in this dispute? They have kind of reached a deadlock right now AFQ:It might be a deadlock, but it s part, again, of the process, and in the past we have seen that these deadlocks are solved, this are positions that are not fixed through time, as conversations evolve, greaterlearning of what are their concerns and the possibilities will be available, and I m sure there will be a solution found To insist, producers must be compensated, without a doubt, this is not a cheap business, and consumers must also count with the certainty that they will have the energy they need The energy, as you may recall, in the international arena is more and more regarded as a human right and this is usually assumed or taken into account in the context of energy property; but, energy is crucial for development of every country, and the solution, to insist, will have to involve producers and consumers alike and this is part of the job, by the way, that of course we have to promote at the IEF SS:Yeah, but it s quite unfortunate that this basic right is not free and cannot be free Now, Ukraine wants to buy gas from Europe, as one of the solutions, and the deal is supposedly better than the one Russia is offering Does Europe have enough supplies to sell extra to Kiev, and be a reliable long term supplier, what do you think? AFQ:Well, right now, this doesn t seem to be evident, but I don t see why it should be a problem for any country to diversify its sources of supply, or of demand That s, as I ve said in the beginning, a sensible energy policy SS:Oh no, diversification is not a problem for anyone, I m just saying this option of buying gas from Europe instead of Russia is that a viable option as of today? That s what I m asking AFQ:As of today well, no Europe needs much more interconnections, and if I understand the question correctly, it involves mainly the countries of Central or Eastern Europe, and in all that part of Europe greater infrastructure is needed for distribution of gas, and investments will have to be made SS:Now, there is this other idea that s been tossed around, specifically by George Soros, I think he is the one who came up with it and then everyone sort of started talking about it It is some kind of coordinated action to bring down price of oil do you think it is a realistic possibility, will the OPEC countries agree to lose revenues in order to follow US foreign policy goals? AFQ:Coordinated actions to manipulate prices or to move prices in particular direction are hardly useful or beneficial What we need is markets that work better, more freely, and that are more resilient So, the actions must be to strengthen energy markets overall, so that we have also greater energy security But either on the supply or the demand side to try to move prices in particular directions beyond the promotion of price stability which is necessary for long term planning and investment I don t think it s in the interest of anyone, and certainly not useful for the promotion of economic growth SS:Now Russia and America have had ideological differences over Ukraine, and the differences are quite acute at this moment but then you see oil giants like BP and Exxon Mobil (and they actually instead of [following the] White House s line have signed agreements with Russia s Rosneft) now, we re thinking over here, don t you find it a little silly, that they are making deals with a company whose CEO can t even visit them or even pay for their lunch, because, he is banned from everywhere I know it s an absurd situation, what do you make of it? AFQ:I think that this is part of a conduct of business, and we have to look at it from a pure framework there is what companies are doing and what states are also involved in, and we are also going to see a process of adjustment in this regard But to qualify this as absurd that s your opinion, it s not mine SS:What s not absurd is not the fact that companies are making deals despite of politics, the absurd [thing] is that the man who is in charge of the biggest company in Russia cannot even visit the companies who is he signing the deals with That s what I meant, I just wanted to be precise Alright, thank you so much for this wonderful insight in the world of energy We were talking to Aldo Flores Quiroga, chief of the International Energy Forum We were talking about how Europe and Ukraine and also Russia can diversify their energy fields It was great talking to you That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co I will see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/167256-eu-energy-independence-ukraine/
"26 May, 2014","‚ÄãChina to be the most important country in XXI century - Jim Rogers, investment specialist","Sanction threats against Russia sent shockwaves of panic across the world of investment There s still those who still believe in the prospects of the Russian economy, despite the political turmoil So, what are these prospects? How are sanctions affecting the financial balance of power? And, finally, what does Moscow s turn to Beijing mean for the future of the global economy? We ask these questions to a renowned investor and businessman Jim Rogers is on SophieCo today Follow@SophieCo_RT SS:Jim Rogers, renowned investor, businessman, author, welcome to the program, great to have you with us We re going to start with sanctions, the West is busy with them, coming up is a new round for Russia but Russia, meanwhile, has made a historic 30 year gas deal with China How painful do you think the consequences could be for Europe and US? JR:Well, I will have to say that Washington seems to be making one mistake after another and I don t like saying it, since I m an American citizen, but, you know, America is driving China and Russia together America is driving Russia more and more to Asia That cannot be good for America but they still keep making mistakes in Washington SS:So you re saying the US and Europe unwillingly pushed Russia and China together? JR:Unfortunately America seems to have really bungled this whole thing very badly As you know, they ve tried to instigate a coup in Ukraine against an elected government, and they did that somewhat successfully, but then they didn t think through the consequences Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted us, Putin now is in control of Crimea, which Russians have controlled for many decades, so that s not so unusual what s unusual is that America didn t think through what they were doing, they seem to just react on a day to day basis, so now Crimea is part of Russia, the Russians have more and more allies in Asia I m afraid America just didn t think it through, they ve bungled, they ve acted on a day to day basis, and they ve reacted to events instead of looking to the future and controlling events Mr Putin seems to have outsmarted Mr Obama SS:You have called US actions in regards to Ukraine another embarrassment for the US foreign policies ù Why? Why do you think the US got involved in the first place? JR:That s an extremely good question Why did they get involved in the first place? Because we have incompetence in the State Department, in Washington I guess they thought that they could take over control of Ukraine, which will give America more influence in central Europe and would certainly damage Russia, but in the end it seems to have strengthened Russia and has damaged America You know, politicians make mistakes; bureaucrats make mistakes all the time Looks like this time it was America that made the mistakes, and not Russia SS:But if you re saying the whole Ukrainian affair is a geopolitical failure for America, why do you think it will also hurt the US economy? Where does the economy come in? JR:I didn t say it s going to hurt US economy, not anytime soon But, if Russia now does more and more trade with Asia, instead of with Europe and the West, then obviously that s not that s good for Russia, that s good for Asia, but America gets cut out and Europe gets cut out You know, Russia used to sell a lot of gas to Europe, it still does, but if they stop selling natural gas to Europe, and sell it to Asia that is not good for Europe, and, ultimately, not good for the US either, because the US and Europe are huge trading partners SS:George Soros proposed opening up US strategic oil reserves to drive the prices down in effort to hurt Russian economy Now, is that feasible? Is punishing Russia worth tapping into those reserves? JR:America does have oil reserves, but they are not enough to I mean, if we ve sold all of our oil reserves, it s not enough to have any kind of significant effect on the world oil market It might make the market go down for a day or weeks, or two weeks, even But, then the markets it s going to go back before, and the market may even go back more, because then America would have sold its oil reserves, and we wouldn t have anything in reserve, so again, you have to ask him, I don t know, but that doesn t seem like a very viable solution to me SS:But once again, in your opinion, if Russian gas is sent flowing eastward to China, and there s trade trouble with Russian gas in Europe will the US be able to fill the gap? JR:No America says it could, but it would take a long time for America in order to get natural gas from America to Europe You don t just sort of snap your fingers and do that You don t just put in on a boat or plane, you ve got to have special ports on both sides, you ve got to have special ships, and you ve got to have natural gas in the right place Yeah, it could happen someday, but some day is a long time away, and if Russia stops selling natural gas to Europe that s going to hurt Europe for several years until American gas can come, and that if we presume and suppose that there is enough American natural gas to ship to Europe Europe uses a lot of natural gas, and America at the moment seems to have surplus of a natural gas will they have a surplus in five years? I don t know Will we have enough to supply Europe gas for many years? I doubt it SS:I don t know if you know that the EU has begun sending financial aid to Ukraine Do you think Ukraine will ever be able to pay that money back? JR:Pay it back to the europeanunion ? No, I doubt it very seriously They re going to have to take that money to pay Russia for the natural gas I think this will be just a form of foreign aid from Europe to Ukraine, if they do it I don t see how Ukraine can ever pay the money back SS:Now, as an investor, what economic benefits are there for the EU and the US? What are they expecting out of this whole affair? I mean, how do you attract investors to the country when there is civil war raging between East and the West? JR:Sophie, you re asking extremely good question I don t see what was in it for Europe and the US, other than some kind of geopolitical game that bureaucrats and politicians like to play I don t see what the purpose of this was other than some kind of supposed chess game I don t see what America expected to get out of it Ukraine has a lot of agriculture, but other than that I mean, those agricultural products get sold on to the world market, so I don t see why America tried to get so involved with Ukraine It just does not make any sense to me, and as I said earlier, it seems to be hurting America now, rather than helping America, since the consequences have not gone the way they thought they would SS:But do you think the West has failed to isolate Russia politically and economically? Or is the West going to end up isolating Russia at the end? JR:I don t see that it has hurt Russia Maybe there s something I don t know, but I don t see that this has hurt Russia in any way at this point SS:What all of this means for the dollar? I mean, last week Russia s economy minister told me that ruble and other national currencies will be used for trade to diversify risk So where does that leave dollar? JR:Again, I don t particularly like saying this, because I m an American citizen, and American taxpayer and American voter, but if you drive people away from the dollar many people now must be saying guys, if we have dollars, and the US decides that they don t like us, they ve going to put sanctions on us! ùSo more and more people would say maybe I shouldn t use the US dollar, maybe I shouldn t have my money in US dollars ùAt the same time, as you know, Russia and China are now going to trade with each other in their own currencies instead of the US dollar More and more people are doing the same thing, they re starting to trade in other currencies besides US dollar This is just a continuing long term move away from the US dollar And, I am afraid, that US is pushing people away from the US dollar with our actions SS:So, if you re saying that other players will move away from the dollar eventually, where does that leave the American economy? JR:The US has been the world s reserve currency, has had the world s medium of exchange and so far we ve been able to do a lot of things because we can just print more US dollars We have a huge balance of trade deficit; we have huge government deficits, because we can print more money If there comes a time that we cannot print money, when the world will not just take US dollars because we say here they are! ù then that cripples America in many many ways The Pentagon, the Defense Department of the US has already said that the deficit in the US is a major potential weakness from the military point of view Just recently, the space people said every country in the world has eventually collapsed ùand the way America is going, we might collapse too This is not me, this is the Defense Department of America, and this is the Space Agency of America saying these things If you read history, Sophie, it s true, it s correct When people do not have the money that they used to have they re limited in many ways You cannot have as many soldiers, you cannot have as many airplanes, you cannot send ships all over the world, because somebody has to pay for it, and if you don t have the money to pay for it anymore, you re in trouble SS:You are known to invest in places where others will not dare to, and right now you seem to be putting your trust in Russia why now, when all the instability in Ukraine is causing the ruble to fall, investors are extremely scared and cautious? JR:It s a been a long term adage in the investment world that you buy when there s a disaster, because if you buy when everybody else is panicking and dumping, you re probably going to make a lot of money in the end unless the world comes to an end I don t suspect that Russia is going to come to an end, Russia has assets, Russia has lots of foreign currency in reserves as well, so when I saw Russia collapsing I thought I should buy, and I did buy I ve been becoming more optimistic about Russia over the past year or two anyway, because you do have big reserves and there are positive changes taking place in Russia as far as I m concerned, so I hope, Sophie, that your parents taught you to buy low and sell high that s what I m trying to do SS:Listen; why not invest in Ukraine in that case? I mean, obviously, that s where the real turmoil was going on, you can buy really low right now JR:I certainly could, but I have only been to Ukraine twice in my life, but I ll tell you I have never been impressed by the government or the management of Ukraine You don t buy something just because it s low because it can get lower and lower and lower I d rather buy a sound situation, rather than one that is in turmoil and it s going to continue to be in turmoil If you ve looked at the Ukrainian government over the past 10 15 years you know what I m talking about Someday, of course, I might invest in Ukraine, but not now SS:So what are you thinking how soon will all this political turmoil blows over for the Russian market? A month, a year? JR:I would suspect that it s going to America may put on some more sanctions of some sort, but even that is not working terribly well As you probably know, the Canadians, who are first allies of America, recently said No, we re not going to do this anymore, we don t want to play this game of sanctions against Russia ù Europeans don t seem to be too keen on sanctions, so I suspect that the sanctions after another round or two will probably sort of dry up and go away, because again, it s doing nothing It doesn t hurt the Russians doesn t seem to There are plenty of people who will do business with the Russians, look at the map, Russia is gigantic country, there are lots of countries that will do business with Russia, and so I don t suspect that this is going to last much longer SS:Now, you personally, in terms of investing in Russia, you re looking at non energy companies Is it right? JR: I have plenty of energy investment, so I m not investing in energy companies in Russia I m trying to find other parts of the Russian economy SS:Well, that s what I was going to ask you what do you invest in, in Russia? JR:I buy the Russian index, which is a basket of Russian shares I own shares of the Moscow s stock exchange, I own Aeroflot, and I m looking for other areas to invest I don t have any others yet, but I m looking SS:Look, I ve got a sense from what you re saying, that the more sanctions are imposed, the more buying opportunities there are in Russia Is that s how it works, exactly? JR:I said, if there are more sanctions ù Washington keeps saying they re going to put on more sanctions, so I presume they will That s what they say they re going to do, they probably will do it And usually, when something like that happens, stock get weak, at least for a while I have no idea of what s going to happen, whether they will do it, or whether the stocks will get weak But it often does SS:Okay, but buying low, like you say, seems like a well known basic strategy but you re not afraid for the long term state of the Russian economy? Even with a possible third wave of sanctions? JR:No, of course My point about sanctions is that they don t seem to be hurting Russia, I don t see that there s any major sanctions that can hurt Russia over any extended period of time, so, no, I am for one do not see how sanctions from America, especially if their allies don t go along with them, or don t go along with them in a big way I don t see how that can hurt Russia other than, maybe, in the short term It s just that I don t see it SS:With all these numerous trade deals, signed in Shanghai, do you think it will lure investors back to Russia, reassure them? JR:Yes I mean, the Russian market is already up over the last couple of months, as you ve probably know Yes, more and more people see that the sanctions aren t very viable, that they haven t hurt Russia in fact, in some ways it is strengthening Russia because now they re doing more business with China China is a pretty successful economy, so it s not hurting, and in some ways it s actually helping Russia, because it s driving Russia to other parts of the world, Russia doesn t have to use the US dollar to trade with China now, because Chinese and Russians made currency deals It s just driving people away from the US dollar, not towards the US dollars SS:Now do you expect seeing gains from your investments in Russia, let s say, during your lifetime? JR:During my lifetime? SS:Yep JR:Well, I hope I ll live a long time, Sophie, so yes I hope I ll live a long, long time SS:Well, we hope too But tell me one more thing: do you think there s a shift in global economic balance? Are we going to see more Asian giants sign economic deals with Russia, you think? JR:Oh, I m sure we will If at no other reason, and the fact that the Russians are now pushing more towards Asia, partly out of necessity, and so you will certainly see I know that Moscow was putting huge amounts of money to the Far East, I know that you ve built a railroad all the way into North Korea I know Russia is putting a push towards Asia, and obviously, if there are opportunities for Asians, they re going to take advantage of it So, no, it s happening SS:You have said that you re that Moscow is on its way to become an international financial center you really think it has what it takes? JR:No, what I ve said was that I m astonished that they think that, that they re going to try I don t know if they can make that Mr Putin says he wants to have Moscow a major financial center I m astonished I ve never thought of Moscow as a potential financial center, but I do know, Moscow is going to spend a lot of money and time and energy, trying to develop itself as a major financial center And just by trying they are going to make Moscow more attractive Whether it works or not in 10 15 years? I don t know, but in the meantime, a lot of money and effort is going into trying to make it a financial center SS:Talking about 10 15 years: I know your children have been learning Chinese from very young age Is that where the future is, in China? JR:In my view, China is going to be the most important country in the 21stcentury, whether we like or not Again, this move of Russia more towards Asia just reinforces that whole trend of China becoming more and more important in the world SS:Why are you investing in Russia, then? Or are you investing in Russia and China as well? JR:Well, Russia is one of the most hated stock markets in the world, perhaps second only to Argentina, which is hated more I have learned, when things like that happen, they usually put it cheap, Russia has a convertible currency, has a very low debt, has lots of resources, and when the stocks get knocked down, I started investing Listen, I was very bearish on Russia for forty six years of my life I ve only started becoming positive on Russia in the last couple of years I do think I see opportunities and therefore I m investing SS:So when did you first come to Russia? JR:I first went to Russia in 1966! And came away pessimistic, and was pessimistic for the next 46 years I knew I wouldn t work But now I see positive changes taking place, and so I ve started investing in Russia SS:So, when was that moment that actually changed your mind? You remember? JR:No, no, it was not anything specific; it was a series of events I went to Vladivostok; I saw what was happening in Vladivostok I saw changes, I went to Moscow a couple of times, I saw changes taking place I heard some of the government officials and what they were doing, how they were setting up investment funds to invest with foreigners, so that everybody would either make money or lose money together I saw a variety of things happening over a period of time, and in that result I decided that Russia wasn t as bad as it had been for 46 years SS:I want to ask one more question about China I m thinking that China is still an emerging market, even though that it is huge and strong, and it hasn t suffered any crises yet But, it might at some point, like all markets do so when that happens, how do other world markets protect themselves, is it even possible? JR:Well, China is the second largest economy in the world, and if the second largest economy in the world has problems, it s going to affect some people If nothing else, the people who do business with China, will be suffering That s a lot of people, because it is such a huge economy now It s just like if America has problems; it affects a lot of people If Japan has problems, it affects some people So there is no question that China will have problems I don t know what, or when, or why but every country has problems, somewhere along the line What is a little bit unusual is that it s been a long time since China has had major problems That is extremely unusual That s one reason I m not buying many shares in China right now: they have big debts, internal debts, so I m waiting in case there s a problem coming out of China If there is problem or some problems, I hope, I m smart enough to buy more china SS:Alright, Jim, thank you so much for this interesting insight, for your advice We were talking to Jim Rogers, renowned investor and businessman, author We were talking about whom the sanctions can benefit and also why should people invest in Russia and not China That s it for this edition of Sophie&Co, see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/161436-china-russia-investment-rogers/

 democracy in Ukraine, many of the same NGOs that helped create
 the current instability in Kiev This is the last thing Ukraine
 needs at the moment, says Engdahl RT:Washington is offering Ukraine a one
 billion dollar loan Is it a good deal for Ukraine? William Engdahl:If you look at the details of
 what they re offering, they re not offering a loan of even one
 billion dollars They are offering a loan guarantee and the cost
 of that loan guarantee is that Ukraine submits to IMF austerity
 like Greece did, and that will simply open up their economy to
 the final rape and plunder from the West But the other point about this is that the debt of Ukraine that
 comes due this year is a staggering amount I believe it is some
 25 billion dollars that has to be rolled over And a one billion
 dollar loan guarantee it s hard to know who is more stupid in
 this piece of legislation: the United States congressmen, who
 voted for this, or the non elected government of Ukraine, if they
 accept this because it is simply a no brainer on all sides RT:Also the bill gives more power to
 America s co called democracy promoting ù NGOs Are these the
 same NGOs that reportedly helped topple the democratically
 elected government there in Ukraine a few weeks ago? WE:Of course, they are They are the National
 Endowment for Democracy (NED), Freedom House, no doubt, the Open
 Society Foundations of George Soros, who always seems to be
 paired up with these organizations John McCain is the chairman
 of the NED s International Republican Institute He has been on
 the front row of every regime stabilization in recent years So
 these are not democracy promoting NGOs, these are coup d √©tat
 NGOs, who are doing what the CIA used to do, only through private
 agencies that are backed up by the US government This is not anything good for Ukraine Ukraine doesn t need this
 nonsense It s interference in the domestic affairs of a
 sovereign country But since when has Washington or at least the
 Congress been concerned about that? RT:So, if they are not going to promote
 democracy, how exactly are their NGOs going to influence
 political life in Ukraine? WE:Well, as you pointed out, the NGOs prepared
 the way for the last several years, well before the decision not
 to join the EU confederation agreement taken by Viktor
 Yanukovich s government last November They had been preparing to
 oust the Moscow leaning Yanukovich, a fairly elected presidentof
 Ukraine, and create the incident using canvas operatives from
 Belgrade financed by US taxpayers money, to train activists
 assembled in Maidan Square and create the movement that shapes
 exactly what the government will or will not be able to do And to do more of that for Ukraine I think Ukraine needs a
 little break from all of this ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/us-ukraine-loan-ngo-945/

 the destruction of its democratically elected government It was also shocking how the Arabic and Turkish press was
 translating and reprinting all that appeared in the West There were no clear, simple and logical explanations of what
 actually happened in Ukraine recently That is, that the West, particularly the greedy and desperate EU,
 wanted to get its hands on the tremendous natural resources of
 the Ukraine, on its heavy industry and cheap but highly educated
 work force They offered a deal A very bad deal, under which,
 European companies would be allowed to plunder the country, but
 Ukrainian people would not be even allowed to enter the EU, let
 alone seek employment there The elected government rejected such farce The West accelerated
 its support to the opposition , which included several
 clearly gangster forces, full of ultra nationalists and Nazis 
 The legitimate government was overthrown Crimea decided to leave
 such an illegitimate entity People voted, democratically Russia
 simply accepted the outcome The West began crying murder, simply because, for once, it was
 not allowed to rob, to loot, what it wanted It is not used to
 such resistance for centuries it has been accustomed to taking,
 to raping and to fleecing anything it fancies In the meantime, the fascist pro Western military regime in Egypt
 (a regime that is actually financed by the US) sentenced 529
 people to death, mostly those belonging to the Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was overthrown last summer There was strong language from the West, but no condemnation 
 Fascist, Pinochet style Egypt is a close Western ally Another ally, Indonesia, a miserable failed state plundered by
 multinationals, with many indicators mirroring sub Saharan
 Africa, has once again been poisoning the entire region, with
 smoke coming from its burning forest fires: proof of a
 gangster run economy Fires are destroying forests and giving way
 to palm oil plantations Again no condemnation Not even an
 alarm Like Rwanda and Uganda, which are by now responsible for between
 6 and 10 million lost lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRC) There, the killing is done on behalf of Western companies
 and governments, so it should not be discussed The same could be said about the present occupation of Southern
 Somalia by Kenyan forces, an invasion that was triggered on a
 ridiculous, pre fabricated platform The destruction of entire nations, as well as the obliteration of
 the environment, is not to be noticed by a fellow looter if a friend does it In our recent book, On Western Terrorism From Hiroshima to
 Drone Warfare , my friend and mentor Noam Chomsky clarified
 how the West reserves the right to ruin, and even liquidate,
 countries that it considers uncooperative, and how it is done
 with absolute impunity, even with legal support Take the invasion of Iraq nothing can be discussed or
 potentially regarded as criminal In fact there is a legal
 reason for that, which is not too well known The United States
 is self immunized from any prosecution When the US joined the
 World Court in 1946, the US basically initiated the modern
 International Court of Justice, which it joined but with the
 reservation that the US cannot be judged by any international
 treaty meaning the UN charter, the charter of the
 Organization of American States, the Geneva Conventions The US
 is self immunized from any trial on those issues And the Court
 has accepted that So, for example, when Nicaragua brought a
 case against the United States at the World Court for the
 terrorist attacks against Nicaragua, most of the case was
 thrown out because it invoked the charter of the Organization
 of American States, which bars interventions strongly, and the
 US is not subject to that and the Court accepted it In fact the same happened, interestingly, at the trial
 where Yugoslavia brought a case against NATO for its being
 bombed, to the International Court of Justice, I think, and the
 United States excluded itself from the case and the Tribunal
 agreed because one of the charges mentioned was that it was a
 genocide, and when the United States signed the Genocide
 Convention after 40 years, it had a reservation saying it was
 inapplicable to the United States , and so therefore the Court
 rightly excused the United States from prosecution There
 literally are legal barriers established just in case anyone
 dares to try to bring some charge against the powerful I am
 sure you recall when the Rome Treaty was signed, and the
 International Criminal Court was established, the US refused to
 participate but then it was more than that The Congress
 passed legislation, which the Bush Administration happily
 signed, which granted the White House authority to invade The
 Hague by force, in case any American was brought there In
 Europe it is sometimes called the Netherlands Invasion Act 
 Well, that was passed here enthusiastically, so the
 self immunization is at many levels One is the impossibility
 to perceive, such as when you deny what happened to the
 indigenous population in the United States, when you just can t
 see it even if it is in front of your eyes The other is that
 it s actually fortified by legislation ù Is such an arrangement outrageous and totally racist? It is, but
 it appears that most Western intellectuals and journalists are so
 disciplined, brainwashed or cowardly, that they hardly notice David Castle, the senior commissioning editor of Pluto Publishing
 House in London is clearly aware of the game the Western mass
 media is playing Pluto is one of the major opposition publishing
 houses in English language Most people in Britain understand international politics
 through television news and mainstream newspapers Both are
 heavily skewed towards domestic issues and so international
 coverage is scanty Major conflicts, such as in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, barely get reported at all Also, most of the
 press is notoriously right wing far to the right of the people
 as a whole, and often owned by media moguls like Rupert Murdoch,
 who aggressively pursue a right wing agenda through their
 publications The state owned BBC is committed to presenting a
 balanced view of political issues, but its concept of balance
 is to present the views of both major British political parties 
 When they agree on an issue such as Ukraine, you can fail to find
 any dissenting voices, ùDavid told me about this issue The question is where this revisionism will take the planet? Is
 the West really ready to face Russia and China, two major powers,
 just to secure fully its dictatorial role over the world? Is its
 greed, is its insane Protestant desire to control and rule, truly
 so overwhelming? It is all resembling, increasingly, gangsterism, not an
 international consensus Christopher Black, a leading international criminal lawyer based
 in Toronto, clearly defines the possible endgame, for this
 report: The Ukraine is the latest theatre of operations in
 the world war that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and the drive thereafter by the West to dominate world resources
 and markets The first theaters of operation in this global war
 were Africa and Yugoslavia In Africa, America ejected France
 from Central Africa and turned Rwanda into a military state used
 to maintain a state of deadly chaos in the Great Lakes region of
 Africa ù The destruction of Yugoslavia during the same period culminated
 in the final brutal NATO attack of 1999 and the overthrow of
 Milosevic in 2001, Black says In rapid succession the NATO
 states attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, then Libya and Syria 
 The ultimate target of these wars is, of course, Russia and its
 vast resources, and those countries such as China, Iran, and of
 Latin America that insist on maintaining their independence and
 sovereignty But these wars cannot be conducted without propaganda, and
 as the wars themselves are total wars that is, wars targeting
 civilians as well as military forces so the propaganda
 techniques used are total, using every aspect of communication
 and penetrating all levels of society Important elements of this
 propaganda are the various war crimes tribunals whose primary
 function is the dissemination of false histories of the wars
 concerned, and criminalization of those who resist, ùBlack
 told me Christopher Black says that we see this technique used in Ukraine
 with the absurd call by the Kiev junta to have President
 Yanukovich charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes
 probably committed by members of that junta Legendary radio host Dr Kevin Barrett, based in the US,
 described the situation in a recent article which made waves all
 over the world It is called USA declares war on
 democracy In Ukraine, Venezuela, and Thailand, as in Syria and Egypt
 before them, the banksters are adding violence to their color
 revolution game plan for destroying democracy This may seem
 incongruous, since the NWO [New World Order] intellectual hired
 gun Gene Sharp, the so called Machiavelli of non violence ,
 designed the original color revolutions as purportedly peaceful
 and democratic uprisings But Sharp's so called color
 revolutions, beginning with Georgia's Rose Revolution of 2003
 and Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2004, were never genuine
 people's revolutions They were bankster takeover attempts from
 the beginning George Soros would funnel Rothschild money to
 ambitious, power hungry apparatchiks, who would inundate their
 target countries with propaganda and hire rent a mobs to dress in
 a particular color and make a spectacle of themselves in a public
 square, in the hope of duping naive young people into joining the
 revolution whose real goal is always to install a NWO puppet
 leader, ùBarrett wrote But Barrett, like myself, is one of those outraged voices
 surrounded by a cacophony of the propaganda dissonance While Noam Chomsky, Christopher Black, Kevin Barrett, David
 Castle and so many other determined free thinkers are constantly
 defining reality as well as the horror of what may yet come, it
 appears that the great majority of the Western public is
 thoroughly confused by, and even shows hostility towards, the
 alternative voices Dmitry Kolesnik, a brave Ukrainian journalist, my translator and
 co editor on the site of Ukrainian leftists, Liva com ua, put
 everything into context What s most remarkable in the Western coverage of Ukrainian
 turmoil? It s the almost total ignoring or even whitewashing of
 those far right and open Nazi paramilitary forces that played the
 leading role in the recent coup There were only some rare
 reports in mainstream media that highlighted the Nazi
 paramilitaries in Ukraine, ùKolesnik said What he is saying could be applied across Zimbabwe, South Africa,
 Egypt, Bahrain, Cuba, China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador,
 Eritrea, North Korea, Vietnam, and dozens of other places
 worldwide Kolesnik continued that as usual the issue of the
 leading role of the far right is dismissed as Putin s
 propaganda So the media willingly turns a blind eye to
 everything that Putin claims If [Putin] claimed that the Earth is round, the Western
 media would most likely denounce it as a propagandist 
 statement And Putin seems to understand it quite well, but the
 Western media denouncing the evident facts reveal their total
 servility, ùKolesnik said He also describes a typical message in online groups of the Euromaidan movement and the network of Nazi Right
 Sector units As far as I follow some groups, I can notice that sometimes
 they mobilize their supporters on a certain day in a certain
 place so as to provide the picture needed: Western journalists
 are coming, so we have to be in the square at and show them our
 democratic intentions Please, no Nazi salutes and anti Semitic
 slogans at this time, as journalists will be there And we can
 see how some mainstream media makes professional reports, ùhe asserts Kolesnik says that when Nazi paramilitaries attack the meetings
 of anti fascist forces, the rallies of the left forces, or
 pro Russian protesters, the Western media never show it But when
 an attack of Nazis is being kicked off, they willingly present it
 as brutality against pro democracy protesters Media
 dubs the unelected Ukrainian regime as legitimate and
 tries not to notice its policy directed to the unleashing of a
 civil war or the ethnic cleansing of the country Actually, we see in media coverage an example of a cynical
 info war, when even Nazi thugs are being whitewashed whatever
 they do Thus, we see in Ukraine a coordinated coalition of
 Nazis, neoliberals, some NGOs and mainstream media all working
 hand in hand for the brutal demolition of the country, ùhe
 says I am finishing this report as my flight begins its descent to
 Kiev International Airport I create a nice, neat folder that
 consists of several international periodicals I am aware that
 soon, very soon, the reality will hit me in the face,
 metaphorically as well as in the real sense Everything will be in reverse of what is so thoughtfully written
 in those well edited and designed propaganda sheets I look at the cover of the Economist and at the tasteless
 caricature of a half naked President Putin on a heavily armed
 tank It reads The New World Order But it is not yet here, this New World Order It is still the
 same nightmare of some dozen or so extremely arrogant, brutal and
 canny Western nations, tormenting the world with impunity And it
 is done, they claim, in order to save it , to make it
 pure and happy, as was done for centuries by fanatical and cruel
 religions The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-intellectuals-standing-ground-833/
"17 Mar, 2014",US foreign aid agencies paid for Kiev street violence - ex-US agent Scott Rickard,"The EU is a hurry to sign the long awaited association treaty with Ukraine, while the new leaders in Kiev are turning to Washington for support Whose interests were at stake during the Ukrainian revolution? Should the promises of the West be trusted by the new authorities? Sophie talks to former US intelligence officer Scott Rickard to find out the answers to these questions Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:You ve said the US government has been preparing the revolution in Ukraine for years; it s invested $5 billion so far in the uprising Where you got this information? Do you have a proof that that s the case? Scott Rickard:Well, it s public information You have the folks at the National Endowment for Democracy who have been doing this since the unfortunate overthrow of your grandfather [Eduard Shevardnadze, former president of Georgia Ed ] The Rose Revolution there were, at least, thousand NGOs operating in Georgia at the time, in the early 2000s, that were very responsible for the opposition movements that happened in Georgia This has been the colorrevolution s that started pretty much alongside of George Soros and all of the other folks that have been involved along the way It s something that has become sort of status quo with American manipulation of foreign governments It s not something that comes as a surprise to me SS:You ve mentioned Georgia and orangerevolution in Kiev 10 years ago, approximately and back then, there was a lot of talk about America and George Soros funding them and he didn t deny actually doing it What about now? Would you say that exactly the same thing is taking place, because many people argue that it s not the case this time SR:Oh, it s absolutely the same thing USAID is implicated, Pierre Omidyar is implicated, you ve got the National Endowment for Democracy which has over 50 NGOs operating there now You also have the ties into Tymoshenko and notorious bosses of bosses, Semion Mogilevich who has been sidekick for the American government preceding the wars against Russia in Afghanistan Semion Mogilevich was a huge supplier of weapons and a huge supporter of American aggression against Russia in Afghanistan in the 80s SS:You ve mentioned Pierre Omidyar as founder of eBay and also George Soros When we talk about big capital and big capital players, we are talking about private businesses who are spending their money on revolution, as you put it What s in it for them? SR:Well, most of the money is coming from USAID and NGOs, and NGOs are actually funded by the government The US government actually funds the National Endowment for Democracy, and a lot of these folks are really closely tied to [Max] Shachtman that worked for Nixon back in the late 60s and who created this organization, and [Carl] Gershman now, who heads the National Endowment for Democracy is yet another prot√©g√© of that whole Shachtmanite issues You don t have to look very far into Ukraine the most powerful, most well known foreigner in the Ukraine today is Yaakov Bleich Rabbi Bleich is the number one guy that they go to, to get information for the State Department about what s going on with the government in Ukraine He s been there for 15 years and even John Kerry on his last visit had a private meeting with the rabbi and the rabbi is tied directly into these sort of National Endowment for Democracy organizations SS:But funding social groups or organizations is it the same thing as funding the revolution? SR:Well, of course if they are tossing Molotov cocktails and not having peaceful, and what I would say, intellectual dialog using communications and paper and creating, what I would say, town halls and discussions that is funding the revolution, if you re inciting violence and the money is basically going to organization that may incite violence against the standing government That is inciting the revolution and I think it s illegal by international laws, by far the US has done it in half a dozen nations in the last 10 years SS:The revolutions that you ve mentioned the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the orangerevolution in Ukraine, the revolution that took place or is taking place right now in Ukraine many would tell you that those are also, besides everything else, a result of acute social protest I mean, surely you can t deny genuine popular discontent even the Russian president said the grievances of people on Maidan are justified to an extent ù SR:I absolutely agree The popular discontent is one thing, but throwing thousands of Molotov cocktails is a completely different thing Put yourself in the US if we had a foreign government funding $5 billion to Canada or Mexico, or maybe a former state that seceded and those people in those protests were throwing Molotov cocktails at government facilities, I can guarantee you they would not show near as much constraint as the Ukrainian government and Russian governments have shown SS:The violence that broke out in Kiev you re saying that was also planned? Or did things just simply get out of control? SR:Saying things are planned ù or gotten out of control ù it s a fine line There are individuals who are very well trained These NGOs operate on every level They operate on this peaceful side and they also operate on the violence side It s pretty clear that Americans have been wildly successful around militarizing jihad and violence and any kind of operations Even Graham Fuller, who was very instrumental in overthrowing the governments in the some of the former Soviet States prior to the 2000 timeframe, really, the demise of the former Soviet states, these guys were very calculated about working with violent organizations to create uprisings You know, Israel was meddling also in Georgia, and the US almost went to war because of senators like John McCain These are situations that continue, and nobody has been really held accountable, because the kind of rhetoric that s played out in the news is pretty much propaganda and that s putting it lightly SS:What Kiev has on its hands right now is a burgeoning black market of firearms in Kiev Do you see that becoming a serious problem? SR:Of course, anytime that you have an unpoliced society, and you begin the chaos, it s much easier because the patrols are less likely it s much easier for people to smuggle things in and out of places Just look at the last three years in Syria how successful the foreign intelligence operatives and mercenaries that have been operating there, have basically destroyed Syria by the hands of foreigners And this is what would be in store for Ukraine if the Russians don t protect the sovereignty of that nation from the foreign interventionists SS:If you look at things generally, do you think all these other protests going on around the world because there are many of them, there is civil unrest in Turkey, there is a whole lot going on in Thailand, in Bosnia Herzegovina is there a force behind them? Is it the same force or are there different players involved? SR:Obviously, the times that we are going through now and kinds of austerity that the europeanunion has gone through, specifically Greece, they ve had probably the worst of the worst, and then you have what s happening in Ukraine with austerity measures People start suffering from an economic explosion that really is in the opposite direction We re looking at times like leading to World War I and World War II, where there was a lot of economic despair, and these are the kind of things we are seeing today because immensely inflated economic environment that has been created by the World Bank and the IMF and all the regular suspects that have created false market and a false narrative of around the domestic products in one country versus the domestic products in the other And that s why you ve got countries like Ukraine the income in Ukraine, the disparity comparatively to the US is almost 10 to 1 that s the kind of things that people are dealing with in developed nations and I think that s the kind of thing that they are uprising against their governments, because some of the governments are corrupt and the people are noticing it Now, is it induced obviously it is induced when it s in the best interest of the US and it s very clear that the US has spent billions of dollars on this over the past, I d say, at least two or three decades SS:Apart from establishing a NATO presence in Ukraine, do you see any other reasons for the US involvement in the country? SR:It s also economic and it s militarily strategic Can you imagine if the Americans took over the ports in Crimea and also, can you image the kind of revenue that they would be able to generate from the gas pipelines, just as they ve done through Dagestan, Georgia, as well as in Chechnya these are business individuals who understand the economics of doing business, just like they do with the oligarchs under Gorbachev Many people made money during the Glasnost period, and they stole a lot of the wealth from Russia during that period, when Gorbachev and your grandfather were working closely with the West That was a time at which, obviously, some oligarchs came to power, and some were more honest than others, and you have that same sort of effect that will happen in Ukraine, because Ukraine has a lot of great resources and as well it has the transit lines for a lot of fuel going to Europe That s the main income, that s helped Russia bounce back three times Russia had to bounce back recently from the kinds of impact that the West has ganged up on Russia, and it s five times if you include World War I and II and actually, the Bolshevik movement as well So the Russians had played comeback many times when they were ganged up by sort of a NATO alliance, because that alliance has been there for quite some time SS:With everything that s going on right now, Ukrainians are saying, the interim government says can you blame us for wanting to be part of NATO? ù What about you? Do you understand why they want to be part of NATO? SR:Yeah, of course if you look at the way that Ukraine is broken up today, there is really only about 15 or 20 percent Russians in major Ukraine, and probably 60 percent, maybe 70 percent in Crimea So it s predominantly Ukrainian you have a lot of folks there, who were very anti Russian because of the terrible things that Stalin did and then obviously you have the folks that were taken out of the area during World War II, because they sided with Adolf Hitler s Third Reich So there is a lot of different factions and, on the west side, it s mostly agriculture, and on the east side it s mostly industrial, so most of the actual financial gains will come from the east and most of the agricultural gains will come from the west At the same time it s much predominantly Ukrainian society and there is a form of nationality that I can understand, you know, why they might want to have it But I think what you ve run into is that they ve fallen into the trap, the EU can t handle another boat anchor you know, they don t need another failed economy, they are failing already It certainly is, strategically, from the military perspective, and from NATO s perspective, they ve been peeling off former Soviet state after former Soviet state, after they promised not to do so, so it s think it s not in good faith what the West is doing SS:If EU can t give the money, as you re saying, what can NATO give them? SR:It s what NATO gives every country they give them massive amounts of financing, they got a lot of financing infrastructure behind it, and they ll create a lot of jobs around just the administration of that kind of activity Look at the announcement in January, making Lithuania one of the leadership roles in the strategic alliance in NATO they re moving closer and closer to the cusp of ¶ and there s a lot of money that comes with that There s a lot of maintenance of the military infrastructure, airbases, facilities, builders it comes with the good price tag SS:So you re saying NATO will give Ukraine money? SR:Absolutely, NATO doesn t just expect you to invest all your money ¶NATO is very complimentary when it comes to helping their allied partners in their infrastructure needs, and that includes everything, it includes fuel lines, it is a strategic military initiative SS:If what you re saying is the case, then it would really 100 percent positive development for Ukraine to be part of NATO; I m not saying for Russia, I m saying for Ukraine SR: Well, I wouldn t say that either Let s say that NATO does want to come in they [Ukraine] also will have to pay debts to their debt masters so they [NATO] will bring the banking system with them, and it s very evident that very few of the new, as well as the existing EU economies ¶because NATO won t come in as a state, run only ¶you know, europeanunion will have to come alongside it So will have some financial gain, but it won t be the kind of the financial gain that will satisfy all Ukrainians It will satisfy a portion of the Ukrainians that are siding with the NATO alliance SS:The new interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has been seeing Obama in the White House lately Do you think he can count on the unconditional help from the US? SR:Sadly, I think the Americans are going to foot this bill There is no way that the EU is going to be able to come up with that kind of funding Russians have already offered $30 billion and that was probably the best deal that they were going to get Even John Hulsman said in last week s interview that you did, that they weren t playing honestly or they just weren t being serious enough, but the fact is that they just can t afford it in the EU So the Americans will end up footing the bill with the economy that s totally busted anyway The only reason it s still alive is because they were granted global currency rights by the British Empire, after the Bretton Woods conference, but it is total farce at this point, because it s all basically paper money that doesn t really exist in this world They are just adding another piece of debt to the American fallacy of an economy I ll be honest with you, I would think Ukraine should be able to see through this and work through this, and actually use their industry and create their own economy and stay away from it I think the Western economy is poison SS:You keep saying that the EU can t afford Ukraine, but the EU is now saying that they will sign an association agreement with Ukraine at the end of May Is EU membership a prospect, do you think? SR:Oh, for sure, if they can do that That s a coup de grace for them, they are obviously looking for that ¶ it s the sort of a NATO expansion mode, I mean it s the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and last time I looked I didn t think that Ukraine was very close to the North Atlantic That s the problem that I have with this You talk about hegemony the growth and the imperialistic nature of the West there is no need to keep adopting nations to this alliance I don t think there is any threat from Russia, and certainly no threat from the Ukraine to the NATO alliance SS:What about these sanctions that the U S and the EU are promising? How serious can they be against Russia, because, I mean, sanctions are nothing new to Russia, but they rarely represent any serious threat to its economy What exactly is the US trying to do with their sanctions? SR:Well, sadly, the Americans have been sanctioning Iran and other countries illegally I think it s an act of war and obviously it wouldn t cripple the Russian economy, but it would certainly inhibit their success They would slow down the amount of success that they are having The kinds of sanctions that they ll go after will probably be looking for alternative fuel supplies for Europe and going after any kind of freezing of international accounts They ve already stolen quite a bit of assets from the Russian investors and Russian bankers who were banking in Cyprus That was a theft of assets in the Cyprus banking infrastructure by the europeanunion , and many Russians who banked offshore in Cyprus took a big hit SS:Exactly how far though can the US go? How far can it afford to go in confrontation with Russia over Ukraine? SR:It won t be as easy for them to do it to Russia as they did to Iran, and I don t think they ll be able to go anywhere near to the damage that they ve done to Iran At the same time they are looking at a scenario whereby that kind of pressure that they do put on Russia ¶you know, it will cripple some of the outlying industry that is associated with that, throughout Turkey and throughout Europe So they ll be shooting themselves in the foot and also having to look to other markets Now, that being said, the Americans are looking at developing other resources, but that will take time SS:But what about Europe, we didn t follow up on that part of the question Europe it is under pressure from the US, but it says it isn t ready for serious sanctions against Russia, despite all Will it ever be? SR:Merkel is ruffling feathers with her commentary and obviously Germany and Russia have very good ties on a lot of different projects other than the petrochemical industry I would say that a lot of Germans would rise up against Merkel for that, because I think a lot of Germans see through the fallacy of the EU and of the NATO alliances and then they are probably more wiser and obviously one of the most successful EU nation states, because the Germans are very industrious and extremely successful at their endeavors I don t that it would last very long, certainly in Germany and in other successful EU states SS:Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, it s probably the only economy that s actually on the rise Everything else is sort of hanging on Germany ¶ SR:Well, England claims to be on the rise SS: ¶It is kind of on the rise, but it is really just floating Europe is promising $35 billion to Ukraine I mean, we keep saying Europe is broke, Germany is the only country that takes care of all the other European countries, ù how can they afford to give $35 billion to Ukraine which isn t even a member of the Union? SR:I really don t think they can I can t wait to see [British MEP] Nigel Farage s commentary on this He is one of my favorite guys who speaks at the europeanunion I think he ll just tear them apart, because he knows the truth is that they don t have the money I guarantee, the German people will not be happy about footing the bill for the Ukraine SS:If they don t have the money, then what s the point of promising it? SR:I think the Americans are basically going to float a blank check to play their cards, and hopefully the Ukrainian people will wise up and realize that they are basically taking funny money RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/ukraine-revolution-usa-support-246/
"14 Mar, 2014",'Britain‚Äôs being relegated to lowest tier in EU‚Äô - UK MP Bill Cash,"The crisis in Ukraine is grabbing headlines, with their economy balancing on the brink of collapse Now, EU cheers up the new authorities in Kiev, promising the money to bring life to near death state of Ukrainian finances but doesn t the EU have bigger problems on its hands? Is it even the role model it proclaims itself to be? Today Sophie talks over these issues with Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament Follow@SophieCo_RT Sophie Shevardnadze:Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament is on our show, it s great to have you with us today I m just going to go ahead and start from the latest news which is Ukraine obviously the EU s Eastern Partnership ambitions and the association treaty are responsible for the current crisis in Ukraine ù Those are your words, so if you elaborate on them how and why? Bill Cash:I m very much in favor of political cooperation, I m also very much in favor of trade throughout Europe and of course with Russia as well, and throughout the world, globally; but the problem is that this particular set of agreements and it s the Eastern Partnership agreement as well as the Association Agreement, have in fact, in my opinion, been far too ambitious It would have been far better if it had been a lower key operation and in fact, Michael Lee, who is with the German Marshall Fund, the other day said that their policy was misconceived ùand he said he was one of the architects of the policy, and he went on to say, I ll just quote from it: This was misconceived from the outset and I was one of the culprits ùIn retrospect, EU made a number of serious mistakes It was not necessary or appropriate to present Ukraine with an incredibly demanding, deep incomprehensive, free trade agreement Now, obviously, people can argue with that, but I think that that is the problem and my concern about the EU, which we may come on to later, is that it is overambitious and that it creates situations and I regard this as a crisis that could have been avoided if they hadn t been so ambitious I would have said that whatever the circumstances may have been when these things were first thought out, first of all, they were overambitious, but secondly, looking at the situation with Crimea and a whole of a Black Sea issue the issue which was a matter of obvious vital national interest to Russia; that that issue, involving these questions as well, was, I would have said, bound to lead to a lot of very serious questions on a part of Russia, and I therefore think that the EU attitude has been extremely na√Øve I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation SS:But what about now, Mr Cash? Ukraine needs at least $35 bln by the end of next year to stay afloat, and it s on the brink of bankruptcy can the EU afford to follow through on its promise to help out? BC:The answer is No ù, and there are serious concerns amongst my colleagues and certainly amongst many of them in the House of Commons, about the costs of all this because when they say 35 billion ùyou can usually add quite a lot more The fact is that proportionately, we re liable I suspect for something of the order of 50 billion pounds worth of that; it may not be as much as that, but one way or another, it is a matter of concern to the British taxpayer and it ought to be a grave concern to the EU, which in many respects is pretty well bankrupt SS:But however much money you give to Ukraine, however much you can afford to give how do you control that money, how can you make sure that the money you give to that country won t end up in the new elite s pockets? BC:Well, that s a very important question It could apply to almost any country of the EU The Court of Auditors in the EU have refused to sign off the European budgetary accounts for the last 21 years so the probability of the money getting astray is very very high, and there is a very track record in relation to the Ukraine in respect of problems of transparency and corruption That is well known Quite frankly, we don t know the answer to the question, other than the probability is that we should exercise extreme prudence and in any case, I don t think the money is there to pay for it SS:Your foreign minister has said that Ukraine can receive assistance in exchange for commitments and reforms What kind of commitments does he mean? What exactly are those commitments? BC:Well, I don t know What I do know is that there are very big questions here I mean, I m not underestimating the importance of trying to achieve a rational and well negotiated answer to these problems I m not in favor of military invasion, I do think that this referendum which is being proposed in Crimea is being taken in extremely short notice and is against the background of quite a lot of pressure which is being exerted by the presence of the military personnel But having said that, I do believe that it is extremely important that this matter is dealt with by rational and proper discussion between all the parties, but on a realistic basis I can understand why Russia would be concerned about the relationship in terms of security and military questions, and the Crimea, which is as I said, of vital national interest in terms of the security of Russia, and has been for hundreds of years SS:Keeping in mind everything you ve said right now, Mr Cash and talking about being realistic what do you think about Ukraine s aspirations to join the EU? How realistic are they? BC:I think the EU has become overextended, I think there are far too many countries I m very much in favor of forms of association between different countries, who voluntarily want to do so, on the basis that they are sovereign nation states I heard George Soros on the radio this morning, arguing this, and I believe very strongly that it is extremely important that countries retain their independence although of course, this is a very good thing for them to trade together and to cooperate I wrote a pamphlet about this in a year 2000, quoting Winston Churchill where he said we should be associated, but not absorbed ù, and I led the rebellion against my own government back in the 1999s, over the Maastricht Rebellion I was the leader of the Maastricht Rebellion against the Conservative government, although I m a conservative member of Parliament, because I thought the EU was overextending itself and so it is proved to be, with terrible results; it is completely dysfunctional It is, in my opinion, nothing like as democratic as it has claimed, not that I m claiming that other countries are as democratic as they should be: the Ukrainian situation at the moment would appear to be based on the government which is an interim government and not elected There is much talk about the rule of law and international law, but I am afraid that I find it very difficult to regard what is going on at the moment, on any side, as being consistent with the international law If I may say with respect, I think that the best that could happen would be that everybody stepped back, paused, and looked at the situation I personally think that these Association agreements should be withdrawn for the time being, at any rate, and that everybody should sit around the table: Russia, different countries of the EU and the U S and take a very deep breath, and prevent what is the dangerous situation from escalating SS:Yeah, but it doesn t seem like the parties involved want to step back and take a look, and take a break I m sure you know about recent leaked conversation between the top U S diplomats which openly dismiss the EU s efforts in Ukraine should the EU swallow its pride and follow America s lead in matters of foreign policy? BC:I think that individual countries within the europeanunion must, and that includes the UK, form their own foreign policy I m not in favor of the European foreign policy, I made that abundantly clear over many many years; You only have to look at the situation that occurred in relation to the Gulf, Iraq, Kosovo I can you give an endless list of failures by the EU It is just simply a complete mess, and I don t think that they are capable of achieving a foreign policy I think that individual countries can still and should cooperate, and to aim for peace and stability and this applies as much to Russia as it does for that matter to any of the other countries I am afraid that the whole aspiration of a EU, a political union, which is absolutely the top of the priorities of the European establishment and the elite, which I oppose very vigorously indeed, is the cause of so many of these problems, both economic, political and in terms of foreign policy SS:The Americans are calling for serious sanctions against Russia, but how far can the EU go with this threat? BC:Well, I ve seen the regulations in question In fact, I m going to a meeting today, where these methods are going to be discussed, and I can only say that I ve seen that they have aimed at certain individuals and there are economic sanctions being drafted and so and so forth But, of course, as George Soros said on the radio this morning Once you start throwing economic sanctions in one direction, they have a way of coming back at you ù, and given the fact that everyone is saying there won t be any military intervention, so far as Crimea as concerned; and that s appears to be ruled out by our foreign secretary and by many others then, there is no ultimate sanction, which is being proposed, and therefore, it would appear to be there are all the ingredients for an escalation of an economic war, and that is actually a very very bad situation When you have economic warfare between great nations, particularly in this global economy, with contractions of the EU, the implosion of European economy, you are bound to end up with more and more difficulties, troubles, and making the situation worse rather than better SS:Now the EU has recently asked London for extra funds, and those funds are amounting to more than UK spends on its own foreign office Surely, there are some benefits to that, right? I mean, some of that comes to the country through the redistribution, foreign trade, right? BC:Yes, I mean, I don t regard the EU as having its own money as such it s a way of interpreting the situation When we get our money back, and we are net contributors on a massive scale, and by the way, it s going up dramatically, thanks to Tony Blair and previous government then I regard that as our money anyway, so I don t regard them as giving us any benefit out of it As far as I m concerned, it s our money and I m very glad we re getting it back again I was the person who put down the amendment for the reduction of the European budget, which was accepted by the House of Commons just before David Cameron made his own very sensible decision to go for the reduction of the budget himself SS:Also, corruption in the EU is another huge problem As one EU official put it, the scale of it is breathtaking ù Is it also felt in London, and what can be done about it? BC:Well, it is breathtaking I may say that I wouldn t exonerate any country, I don t know for certain, but from all the reports that one gets, there is also corruption in Russia and corruption in the Ukraine, and in many other parts of the world It s just one of the modern scourges of a global economy It s same in China and various other countries, by all accounts All I can say is that it has to be dealt with The court of Auditors of the EU do their best We have a debate on that in the House of Commons regularly every year I ve in fact been on the European Committee of the House of Commons for 30 years now, and all I can tell you is that it hasn t been signed off, as far as I m aware, for the last 21 years, so the accounts are extremely dubious and corruption is rife I personally think this is one of the problems of the EU that would be best dealt with as we do in the House of Commons through our public accounts committee which supervises and audits our national accounts, and they have done very well indeed, but bringing this to Europe is another story altogether SS:Germany is the strongest economy in the Europe, bearing the brunt of a string of bailouts, but also calling most of the shots as well Did Germany create an accidental empire out of the EU? BC:I am extremely concerned about anyone country having a predominant role in the EU We are locked into it by a virtue of treaties and through the European Communities Act of 1972, I ve argued against this for extremely long time, but I don t think that the consequences and this is a very large subject of majority voting and co decision in the European Parliament and inadequacies in the way that European Parliament functions are a proper way of sustaining the kind of democracy we need I think that Germany has the disproportionate amount of power in that context, because those countries economically dependent on Germany inevitably look to Germany, economically and politically I don t think that s healthy, as I ve said in Germany itself, I don t think it s healthy for Germany and I don t think it s healthy for Europe as a whole SS:Now you ve said in many instances the EU is a failed project Why? And, what is the alternative to the EU in that case? BC:There is a positive message and that positive message is that there are many values and many democratic aspects of the individual member states, which, in combination through sensible cooperation, without pushing individual countries too far in the given direction, without anyone dominant country, without in fact Britain being relegated to the second tier of the two tier Europe which is what is going on, which is totally and utterly unacceptable and the British people by considerable margin agree with what I ve said over this, over the last 20 years there is an alternative, which is both peaceful, prosperous, stable and uncorrupt and transparent But it has to be based on democracy and democracy is about the votes of those people, in UK, as far as I m concerned, within general elections when they decide the government that they want That is the key issue, and we go back to that, I go back to that every single time SS:Talking about great democracy and protecting it you ve also said that the right of people to choose the laws they want will be under threat in case of further European integration What exactly did you mean? BC:Well, exactly what I ve just said By majority voting, which is increasing and moving into more and more areas, with the Lisbon treaty, which I opposed, and yet it is now being implemented by our government, and it contains a lot of issues, including increases in majority voting, which deprive the British people of having the kind of laws that they wish to have for themselves, which they should be allowed to choose through their elected representatives because that is the essence of what David Cameron said when he said that the National Parliaments are the root of our democracy SS:But, here s another thing You ve been against all things EU for ages, but only now you and your views are making it into the mainstream what s changed? BC:Well, I think that s the recognition that it didn t work It has taken a very very long time People move slowly in these matters, and the establishment in the elite have their ability through the control over leaders of government, the spin masters and also their contacts and the manipulation of the arguments, to create circumstances in which it s very difficult for those of us in the back benches to win the arguments It his extraordinary, how often, great issues in the UK and the UK s Parliament have ultimately been decided by the views of those who were in the minority, who ve ultimately been demonstrated to have been right not with any great self satisfaction, because as far as I m concerned, it s all pretty obvious, and was when I started arguing about this matters in the late 1980s SS:Now, some MPs are saying that the scale of immigration has left Britain unrecognizable, with some parts of the country alienated, even Do you share this sentiment? Is the EU to blame for this as well? BC:I am very concerned about the scale of immigration You have to remember that unlike Russia, the UK is a relatively small land mass Unlike France it is a relatively small land mass And the fact is that we have a capacity which is being exceeded I am actually not in principle against immigration I have to say that, I believe that it is a very good thing for people in individual countries to move from one country to another, and I think it is a very healthy thing economically for that to happen But, by the same token, there have to be limits An uncontrolled immigration, as conservative party and David Cameron made clear, is not a good idea, I happen to agree with that, but much of our immigration also comes from our Commonwealth, from the former Empire, and that has also contributed to both benefits and disadvantages SC:Thank you very much for this interesting conversation Bill Cash, a conservative member of the British Parliament, talking to us about whether Ukraine could have its rightful place in the EU, also talking pros and cons of Britain s membership of the EU That s it for this edition of the Sophie&Co, we ll see you next time RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization TV Novosti ù, 2005 2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/british-mp-eu-problems-738/
"13 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãEU stagnation: Why Soros says the Euro threatens the Union,"Philosopher, plutocrat, poseur or perfectionist investor, George Soros has a remarkable pedigree for prophecy His latest assessment? The euro may kill the EU itself Thanks to his investment acumen, George Soros is doubtless the
 richest philosopher in history, a position which has allowed him
 to bankroll all manner of activities from sponsoring Xerox
 machines in the Soviet bloc during the cold war to helping
 rebuild the New Europe towards a path of greater freedom after
 the collapse of Communism Ultimately Soros greatest investment
 successes have been at what he calls inflection ùpoints
 essentially where the linear process previously taken for
 granted, reaches maturity and there is a short sharp shock as the
 system reverses course in search of a new equilibrium Perhaps
 more famous for endorsing liberal causes in the USA; in Europe,
 Soros is legendary for realizing the British Pound would have to
 exit the pre Euro Exchange Rate Mechanism, giving his fund a
 profit of a billion Pounds ($1 6 billion) Indeed, remaining outside the doomed euro has greatly benefitted
 Britain despite short sighted Europhile ranting that Britain
 would be left behind by a great new wave of European growth The
 growth has instead turned to despair as the eurozone, at best,
 stagnates As Soros notes, the euro was an incomplete project, a
 currency without a common treasury This has left sovereign
 governments exposed to risk of default Had they maintained their
 own currency, governments could print more money to avoid
 euro style default pressures The euro has perverted the entire EU dream A voluntary
 association of sovereign and equal states surrendering some
 sovereignty for the common good has instead deteriorated into a
 highly toxic relationship between creditors and debtors A
 seismic fiscal fissure has created a two tier Europe of haves and
 have nots A new feudalism is developing, led by the wealthy
 Germans who claim hegemony over (Mediterranean) debtor states In
 his new book The Tragedy of the europeanunion ùSoros
 adds that the double meaning of the German word Schuld ù has
 played a key role It means both debt and guilt This has made it
 natural or Selbstverstandlich ù for the German public to blame
 the heavily indebted countries for their misfortunes ù Soros is quick to note how this German position reeks of
 hypocrisy as Berlin broke euro treaty rules as early as 2003 
 Moreover, while the likes of Spain may not have had ideal
 economic policies, they were not, (like the Irish and others)
 explicitly culpable for their woes Rather they had to support
 foreign banks at the whim of Berlin and Paris et al Alas,
 Greece, Soros notes, is an entirely different issue: an entirely
 dysfunctional economy which lied in order to gain access to the
 euro (that EU hubris still permitted them in, is a separate area
 for discussion) Germany has little intention of doing more than the minimum to
 keep the euro currency alive That is a recipe for stagnation and
 Soros explicitly suggests the EU may not survive ùThis
 situation is exacerbated because the banking sector is
 acting as a parasite on the real economy Leverage remains
 too high and the threat of too big to fail ùstill looms
 over the real economy Sadly, the EU s embrace of a socialist
 corporatist model with their bank brothers means they have
 stubbornly failed to address the key factors which created the
 path to melt down in 2008 Like him or loathe him, George Soros has a remarkable pedigree in
 spotting systemic weaknesses His capacity for forensically
 analyzing complex systems has been remarkably, and repeatedly,
 successful Moreover, the europeanunion s fate is shaping up to
 resemble Japan s a nation which has had 25 years of stagnation 
 However Japan is a homogeneous unitary state The EU is a mixture
 of nations who have provided varying (modest) degrees of consent
 only for the anti democratic ethos of the EU to take control of
 increasing amounts of their lives Whatever consent the EU may
 feel it has, that is evaporating rapidly as so many citizens are
 left without jobs or prospects Eurozone unemployment is stagnant
 at 12% overall with extremes for youth unemployment in the region
 of 50% on the Mediterranean Ultimately that is entirely
 unsustainable When an analyst and investor with the pedigree of
 Mr Soros expresses a belief that the stubborn, cruel maintenance
 of the euro could provoke the collapse of the EU, it deserves to
 be taken seriously ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/eu-stagnation-soros-euro-598/
"13 Mar, 2014",‚ÄãSoros tells Europe: Imposing sanctions on Russia not the best way forward,"Billionaire financier George Soros says the Ukrainian turmoil is a wake up call ù for Europe, which should remember its aim and focus on integration The EU must aid Ukraine financially or technically, rather than cut ties with Russia It s very important to respond and respond the right way
 which is not necessarily to impose sanctions on Russia, but to
 actually help Ukraine financially and also technical assistance,
 something like a European Marshall Plan for Ukraine, that would
 be the right response, Soros said in an interview to
 Bloomberg Under the post war Marshall Plan the US provided help to Western
 Europe worth billions of dollars in the form of food, fuel,
 machinery and investment Europe may face 25 years of stagnation if government officials
 don t make an effort to strengthen and further integrate the
 currency union, Soros warned Such a prolonged economic slowdown
 may prove unsustainable for Europe, he added The financial crisis in Europe which began in 2010 has almost
 ended However the region is still facing a political crisis,
 which has split the area into country creditors and country
 debtors, Soros said You have to go further with the integration You have to
 solve the banking problem, because Europe is lagging behind the
 rest of the world in sorting out its banks ù At the same time banks are oriented to passing the stress tests,
 instead of stimulating the economy by capital injections in
 business, Soros believes According to Soros, the EU gave a poor option to Ukraine which
 gave the advantage to Russia Europe, true to form, demanded a lot and offered
 little, Soros said It was not difficult for Putin to
 come up with a better offer The crisis in Ukraine emerged last year when former President
 Victor Yanukovich decided not to sign an association agreement
 with the europeanunion , and instead opted for help from the
 Russia The move caused mass protests in Ukraine which led to
 Yanukovich s overthrow Now the country faces an economic crisis
 and military pressure from Russia George Soros, a magnate and investor is known as The Man Who
 Broke the Bank of England because of his short sale of $10
 billion worth of pounds, giving him a profit of $1 billion during
 the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis ",https://www.rt.com/business/soros-europe-russia-sanctions-514/
"27 Feb, 2014",‚ÄòWest plays with fire to drive the Russian naval base out of Crimea‚Äô,"Crimea s ethnic composition and Western policy towards Ukraine could create a Kosovo like scenario where the majority of Russian speaking residents would claim independence which could lead to violence on the ground, Oxford historian Mark Almond told RT RT:If the EU and the US are concerned about
 doing what people on the Maidan want, why are they ignoring what
 people in Crimea want? Mark Almond:Well one would have thought so if
 you re going to listen to the crowd on the street on the square
 and there are many squares where there re crowds including
 Simferopol and Sevastopol The basic problem of course is what
 the Americans, particularly the lead military power in NATO want,
 is to eventually ease the Russian navy out of its base, out of
 its lease in Sevastopol in the Crimea And so of course the fact
 that the great majority of people in Crimea not only 60 per cent
 that are actually Russian but many of the rest who speak Russian
 as their everyday language is something that the EU and NATO
 countries want to ignore Of course if you have any kind of push
 to create a crisis, I m afraid our democratic basis as in Kosovo
 where the great majority, where the great majority of Albanians
 wanted to be independent from Serbia, you would create a Kosovo
 crisis in Crimea But of course strangely enough Washington and
 Brussels suddenly aren t terribly interested in this I myself
 think that creating a crisis is not a good idea, but nonetheless
 they seem to be bent on pushing to increase tension between
 people on the Peninsula And of course there is a risk of
 violence against either ethnic Russians, civilians that are there
 or against the sailors and soldiers on the base RT:The Crimean Tatars have long been
 calling for the establishment of their own autonomy, why are they
 now siding with the pro EU crowds in Kiev? MA:I think this is a very incoherent position 
 The Tatars historically are seen as the traditional native
 inhabitants of the Crimea Catherine the Great s Russia took over
 250 years ago and then of course Khrushchev, the communist
 dictator gave Crimea to Ukraine only 60 years ago The Tatars
 feel that they have been neglected and eventually many of them
 who have been forced out of their territory have come back But I
 think it is a great mistake to think that they are the supporters
 of the Ukrainian nationalism My experience in the Crimea is that
 most Tatars speak Russian as their everyday language and of
 course they do learn Tatar as well And they don t have any great
 sympathy for Ukrainian nationalism and now of course the
 transitional government in Kiev has abolished the language
 rights, not only Russian but of Tatars and Hungarians in the
 West So again we have this paradox The EU is a great believer
 of minority rights, except when these minorities aren t fully
 paid up supporters of its crowd on the streets of central Kiev 
 And I think again many Tatars in fact walked to the
 demonstration, I don t think that we should overate the fact that
 a group of people, many of them have been beneficiaries of George
 Soros s language schools and scholarships We should not be
 overrating how many of the many thousands of Tatars who live in
 Crimea necessarily want trouble I think this is an exaggeration RT:At the start of the rally in Crimea, we
 saw the Tatars vastly outnumbering the ethnic Russian crowd Does
 that reflect the real numbers among these ethnic groups
 there? MA:No, of course what we see, actually what we
 saw on Maidan Square in Kiev, strangely enough the spontaneous
 demonstrations of pro westerners is much better organized, funded
 when you bring in Brussels and lorry loads of people But of
 course once this crowd assembled, I m afraid it drew out the
 majority of the local population who are Russians, and this is
 very dangerous It seems to me that the Americans and the people
 in the Soros foundation who support these local nationalist
 groups are playing with fire Because if you begin to send out a
 relatively small crowd of people to ban things that frighten the
 majority of people in the first place It is very dangerous just
 like it would be if suddenly a lot of Russians appeared in Lvov,
 in Western Ukraine and started saying Shouldn t we all be part
 of Russia ù It would be very provocative and very dangerous But
 it seems to me that the West is not totally concerned about this
 danger and that I think could lead to another Crimean War
 exploding in our faces 160 years after the last one RT:How did these ethnic groups end up in
 Crimea anyway? MA:As I ve said about 250 years ago, Crimea was
 ruled by the Muslim Tatar Khans who were subjects of the Ottoman
 Empire Catherine the Great of Russia conquered what we now call
 the Ukraine and the Crimea Then with the WWI, the Russian
 Revolution tool place and the anti communists were driven out of
 Crimea and most of Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union When
 Hitler came in 1941, he eventually captured Sevastopol in Crimea 
 But when the Nazis were forced to withdraw, Stalin took the view
 that the ethnic Tatars were being anti Russian, anti Soviet have
 collaborated with the Nazis I think this is a travesty of the
 behavior of most those Tatars, although ironically now we have
 Germans newspapers saying, how wonderful the Tatars are to be
 collaborating with the united Europe Leave that aside, huge
 numbers of Tatars were deported to Central Asia Eventually in
 the Gorbachev period 30 years ago they were allowed to return, to
 come back to the Crimea Sadly in the meantime all sorts of other
 people, who lived there themselves of course, could be Russians
 for generations, or people who in the Soviet period have moved
 in, are living where they re used to live So the tragedy for many of the Tatars is that they have left
 where they have grown up in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, come back
 to the Crimea and find nowhere to live, live in poverty and I m
 afraid to say some of whom may be agitatedbecause of the living
 rate poverty People also in the Western Ukraine do when somebody
 comes and says, you could have a career, here is a little bit of
 money to set up an activist NGO group and so on who would not
 take it if you are destitute And that I think is the danger We
 have in fact an under employed population who can be agitated RT:So what do you think will happen next in
 Crimea? MA:Well Crimea which is such a beautiful place
 should be the center of interaction between the Russian cultures,
 Chekov lived there, of Tatar culture and the playground on the
 seashore The danger is if you allow people to be obsessed that
 one nation has to dominate, and in this case a very small number
 of Ukrainians who live in Crimea are being used by the great
 majority of the Ukrainians who live outside the Peninsula and by
 the West because it wants to get rid of the Russian naval base,
 to be a battering ram And I think this is very dangerous 
 Ideally Crimea would be a sunny playground for everybody to
 enjoy Sadly, I think people from a long way away are prepared to
 play with fire to drive the naval base out But if we remember
 what happened in 1850s, we can discover that the Crimean conflict
 can turn out to drag in other people ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/ukraine-crimea-west-policy-942/

 from US hardliners with their you re either with us or
 against us rhetoric A decade ago Iraq was branded a rogue state ; today, moderate estimates speak of an Iraqi
 death toll of 500,000 since the 2003 invasion and civil
 war Iraq is clearly the most famous rogue state, if we are to believe
 the two Bushes, especially the junior George, who rammed into
 that country in 2003, all but destroying it, maiming its people
 and proud 3,000 year old heritage † All based on an outright
 lie: the infamous weapons of mass destruction they were accused
 of hiding, but that were never found In those days of hysterical mainstream media warmongering George
 W , Tony Blair and their henchmen had their way, bombing the
 country to smithereens A decade on, we learn from areportjust published in the Public Library of
 Science Medicine Journal that, based on household samplings, an
 estimated 500,000 men, women and children have been killed since
 the invasion A moderate estimate, since others go significantly higher Take
 The Lancet, one of the world s oldest medical journals, which
 published two peer reviewed studies, the latest in 2006 putting
 the figure in excess of 650,000 Or ORB (Opinion Research
 Business) an independent polling agency in London, which in 2007
 published a study estimating total Iraqi war fatalities between
 2003 and 2007 at over 1 2 million All because Bush, Blair and their allies got it all wrong ù about
 Saddam s WMD s: We never found em, ùsaid George
 W , who then went on to joke about the whole affair during a
 White House dinner in March 2004 Clearly, blatant genocide and war crimes committed by the West s
 top leaders in broad daylight over which nobody seems to be
 responsible No one was ever made accountable; no one ever
 bothered to apologize to Iraq or to the world I guess they ve all been too busy going after and smokin out 
 other rogue states like Syria, where the civil war against the
 legal government of Bashar Assad that is being waged by US, UK,
 French, Saudi and Israeli backed/trained/financed terrorists
 (including Al Qaeda offshoot Al Nusra Front) has already cost
 over 120,000 Syrian deaths, mostly civilian Then there was Libya in 2011, where interim democratic 
 government estimates speak of as many as 30,000 dead, including
 the execution of Muammar Gaddafi and many of his family members
 and government officials God only knows how many were actually
 shot, bombed, and lynched like Gaddafi by the NATO backed
 freedom fighters there Add to this the impossible to calculate number of dead, maimed
 and murdered during the Western Powers engineered Arab
 Spring throughout the Arab World over the past three years,
 plus the decades long Palestinian tragedy at the hands of their
 Israeli run Concentration Camp Kommandants, and we re talking
 about many millions of deaths which begin to echo the so, so
 oft repeated 6 million figure So be careful, world! † Make sure your country s not branded
 a rogue state , because if it is, then you re in for a
 lot of trouble! First of all, the term more importantly, the concept was made
 popular during the Clinton Administration It was formally
 introduced by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in 1994 when
 then National Security Advisor Anthony Lake published a report in
 CFR journal Foreign Affairs, claiming the reality of
 recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain
 outside the family [of democratic nations] but also assault its
 basic values ù In typical self righteous US ranting, he then went on to label
 North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Iran as rogue states That
 initial list grew with time to include Sudan, Afghanistan,
 Somalia, Serbia, Montenegro, Venezuela all backed by PsyWar
 name calling like Axis of Evil , Outposts of
 Tyranny and Terrorist States But, to understand what a rogue state is, we first need to
 understand what a rogue state is not in today s world according
 to the US/UK/EU/Israel Let s begin by describing the four things that every country must
 do in order not to be branded a rogue state by the global
 hegemons: 1) General behavior: Every nation must maintain unconditional and
 unflinching alignment to the present world order controlled and promoted by the global powers that are embedded
 deep inside key Western military powers, notably the US If a nation heeds, obeys, acclaims, pays tribute and is
 subservient to the on going economic, financial, political,
 historical and cultural world outlook and order, and remains
 passive whilst the global powers prepare the coming new world
 order whether under the guise of the Western
 democracies , or globalization , or the
 international community or, soon to come, World
 Government then you re OK If, however, a nation dares defy any aspect of this, it will soon
 find itself slipping fast into rogue state mode That s
 what happened to Saddam in 1990 after he invaded Kuwait without
 first getting the proper green light from the US; that s
 what happened to Argentina s pro US military junta in 1982 when
 General Galtieri tried to take back the Falkland Islands from
 Britain without Washington s OK 2) Specific behavior: Then, every nation must maintain
 unconditional alignment to specific US/UK/EU/Israel dictated special interests involving the country and its region 
 This naturally varies from country to country and fluctuates as
 specific interests of the hegemon evolve † Some examples: ¢ Egypt: Total alignment to Israel and its geopolitical
 interests That was quite a historical somersault for Gamal
 Nasser s country to make, considering that for decades Egypt
 spearheaded Arab opposition to the West s imposing of Israel on
 Palestinian territory Hosni Mubarak was their man who for 32
 years kept Egypt on course until † Until he
 stupidly breached condition No 3 (see below) ¢ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain:
 Keep the oil flowing, be nice to our oil companies and to Israel,
 and your leaders can do whatever else they like (see 4, below) ¢ Argentina: Never, ever launch a proper investigation into the
 country s decades old mostly illegitimate even illegal public
 debt rooted in the 1976 1983 US backed military regime Because if Argentina were to do that it could then declare huge
 chunks of it as odious debt suing the mega bankers in
 US/EU courts Such table turning would make Goldman Sachs,
 Citigroup, JPMorganChase, HSBC, the IMF/WorldBank/FED and vulture
 funds really angry One other thing: now that your 30 year old
 democracy has destroyed Argentina s armed forces and sunk the
 country into unprecedented decadence, don t even think of making
 a policy U turn Keep all of this going and your leaders too can
 do whatever else they like (see 4, below) 3) Internal control & credibility: However, if a nation s
 leadership behaves nicely , yet cannot control its own
 population and maintain domestic credibility, then like it or
 not, we re going to have to replace you † And if you don t
 like it, well, they will just make you an offer you can t a Hosni Mubarak of Egypt: When the Tahrir Square uprising began
 he proved unable to maintain order and credibility It turned out
 that 32 years is just too long stay in power even with US money
 and support, so out the window he went When Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton visited Egypt in March 2011 to make sure
 Egypt gets the kind of democracy that we want to see, ùMuslim
 Brotherhood president Morsi was not what she had in mind, so he
 too went out the window thanks to a US backed military coup Aren t military coups supposed to be done by undemocratic
 SOB s? † Yes, but as President Franklin Roosevelt once
 famously said of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, he may
 be an SOB, but he s our SOB! ù b Fernando de La R√∫a of Argentina: Elected in 1999, he was 110
 percent compliant with (1) and (2) above, however he was most
 inept in the way he bled the country so it would pay its pound of
 flesh to international mega bankers His internal credibility and
 grip collapsed and Fernando was forced to escape aboard his
 chopper from the roof of the Casa Rosada presidential palace into
 oblivion, as his police killed and beat up protesters on the
 Plaza de Mayo square below Twelve years on, with Argentina s democracy about to
 celebrate its 30th anniversary, its present political managers
 are again losing grip: a new bout of spares and replacements 
 are thus needed, and you can bet your bottom dollar that they
 have been identified and are being positioned to become
 Argentina s soon to come new government Just make sure
 that they too continue being serial debt payers to the
 global mega bankers as president Cristina Kirchner recently
 described her and her husband s more than 10 year tenure in
 power 4) Corruption galore: The global powers message to all national
 political leaders: as long as you fully perform and comply with
 (1), (2) and (3) above, you can sink your grubby hands into all
 the money you want The message is clear: perform as we need you
 to perform on the above key issues, and we don t really care if
 you steal millions, hundreds of millions or even billions from
 your own people, whether by imposing endemic poverty on the local
 population or as outright theft CitiCorp, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros, Goldman Sachs, US
 Treasury, the IMF & World Bank couldn t care less if Mubarak,
 Berlusconi, Rajoy, Fujimori, Menem, Calder√≥n, Lula and Kirchner
 steal from their own people If they can get away with it whilst
 maintaining their local credibility and grip, it s just not an
 issue If anything it s an added asset for the elite, because
 should such local leaders misbehave , they can then be
 easily blackmailed out of power That, in a nutshell, is how the global powers exert control over
 whole countries and regions by ensuring their chosen local
 managers are placed at the helm of national governments to do
 the elites dirty work for them As long as these leaders behave
 and perform properly they can stay on for decades just like
 Hosni Mubarak If they misbehave or their useful lives expire, they re
 then quickly shown the exit and shoved out the door When their
 crimes and thefts are publicly exposed their own local
 populations will do the kicking out for them Saddam was so useful during the eight year war of attrition
 against Iran in the 80s (Iran was Ronald Reagan s original rogue
 state), even Don Rumsfeld shook Saddam s hand and gave him
 chemical WMD s to use against Iran s Ayatollahs After Kuwait,
 however, Ronnie s Veep the Elder Bush gave Saddam quite a
 thrashing, but he didn t learn his lesson So Baby Bush taught
 him good in 2003 Sure, it s not all that simple: each country has its own
 characteristics, its own problems, its own usefulness for the
 global powers In fact, each country is a testing ground and a
 learning ground, the lessons of which are later put to good use
 in other countries and regions So, nations of the world: you ve been warned When walking
 amongst fierce beasts, make sure you do so quietly, cautiously
 and discreetly Be not too defiant lest you too are branded a rogue state Then
 you ll be in real trouble! Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

Cyprus which like its recent Greek, Irish, Spanish, Portuguese
and Italian versions continues to fester like a malignant tumor
in the body politic and economy of the europeanunion When times are stable and predictable, economics is treated like
a science by bankers, academics, journalists and politicians
aligned to the money power elite All economic and social woes are explained away as resulting
from the laws of the economy ùand the invisible hand of
the market ù † Economists theorizing mumbo jumbo never
tells you is that the invisible hand ù is moved by a muscular arm ùthat is directed by a perverse brain They try to convince us that it s normal ùfor markets,
sectors and entire countries to go up, down, sideways, even dive
into mega collapses Such economic nonsense is normally signed by Harvard, LSE or
Chicago University eggheads, suitably prestiged with Economics
Nobel Prizes, and lavishly promoted by the mainstream specialized
media like the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times However, as soon as the economic weather turns foul and the
waves of currency instability, winds of banking crises and tornados
of panic start rocking the boats of national and regional
economies, that s when the science of economics ùtakes a
really bad turn and it s every many for himself! † Or every
banker gets government ùto bail them out In economics what counts is Confidence and Trust, either real or
perceived That s why banks head offices tend to look like
veritable fortresses or gigantic skyscrapers, often with imposing
temple like columns, giant staircases and forbidding iron clad
gates † The idea was clear: when you enter a bank, you enter
the Temple of Mammon † Financial Olympuses like the FED, Bank
of England, and most every central bank beckon you to trust ùthem, just as you trust your God when you enter
Church; to have confidence ù in them for, like the Almighty,
bankers want to make you believe that they too reign for ever and
ever But, alas, as Patrick Young writing on RT Op Edge on Cyprusclearly explains, confidence remains a
rather intangible item Measuring trust is rather a black art We
can never be absolutely certain we have 100%
trust ù Indeed! † Trust is like virginity: once it s gone, IT S
GONE † So when trust turns sour regarding a particular bank,
or rumors arise of impending monetary collapse, or some major
corporation is about to be AIG ed ùout of existence, then trust and confidence ùturn into bank runs, panic and deadly
collapse What Cyprus 2013 shows is that, like Argentina 2001, trust
and confidence ùhave little or nothing to do with reality
especially when passed through the mainstream media s Lies
Machine for, like all perceptions, they can be manipulated to
fool, confound, hide ugly truths and distort When things start going really bad, fraudulent lies are
maintained for as long as possible to give those who DO know the
truth, the chance to exit quietly and unscathed † Once they
are at a safe distance then yes: all hell can be let loose! That happened during Argentina s massive banking, financial and
monetary collapse of 2001/2: social chaos, dozens killed in clashes
with police, 50% of the population buried below the poverty line,
40% drop in GDP, and yet not one single private bank folded! Argentina s then president Fernando De la R√∫a and his
Rockefeller Soros wizard Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo did
everything the mega bankers needed to weather the storm, but
nothing to help we the people ùwho lost life savings, jobs,
homes, health benefits Not surprisingly, after more than a decade Argentina s
government ensures a business as usual ùbanking atmosphere:
politicians and megabankers always cozy up to each other
(money sloshing tends to do that ) What about we the people ù ? † Argentine workers
continue biting the dust suffering all sorts of
government triggered abuse inflation, a total foreign exchange
lock down, and ferocious tax collector persecution †
Why? † When President Kirchner of Argentina must choose between
local workers and global megabankers, she systematically chooses
the latter with suitable media marketing of course Does this ring a bell? † Spain? † Italy? †
Greece? † Ireland? † Cyprus? Occupy Wall Streeters ? A tip: don t believe the mainstream media; don t believe
government liars; above all: don t believe the megabankers! Example: If you re having a drink at the pub and your mate
knocks your pint of beer on your lap: Ooops! † Sorry!!
Acccident † If he does that again 5 minutes later: Gosh what
bad luck!!! † If he does that a third time: HE S DOING IT ON
PURPOSE! † For some reason, it s the guy s behaviour pattern so
best to keep away from him! Now look at recurrent sovereign debt banking crises: Argentina
suffered four debt crises ùover the past forty years that
were all so similar to what later happened in 2008 in the US; which
was identical to the banking crises in the UK and Iceland, which
were then repeated in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy; which
flared last year in Greece and today robs Cypriot workers down to
their bones † Accident? † Bad luck? No It s a
System! We are in fact dealing with major fraud perpetrated by the
global megabanking establishment and done legally ùbecause
they pay for, finance, position and control key government posts in
the executive, legislative and judicial branches of governments in
just about every country Whether Argentina or Brazil, the US or Britain, Spain or Italy,
Greece or Cyprus † Same story; even the same players Because the global megabanking establishment have worked really
hard through their media, universities and their own players to
blind us to a key factor no one ever talks about: the difference
between public money (issued by the State) and private money
(created by private banks almost out of nothing) Publicmoney are the dollar, euro, peso and pound bills
circulating in different parts of the world issued by public
banking authorities, normally a national central bank having
monopoly issuance rights † Any private citizen doing the same
will, if caught, end up in jail † And rightly so because
counterfeiting currency adds money to the system but no work is
added to the Real Economy † The message to the people is
clear: You want money? † Work for it! Privatemoney, however, is created by the private banking
system thanks to Fractional Lending which legally allows them to
create loans for 10, 20 or 50 times the amount of deposits in their
vaults and then charge interest for them! † But private bank
money is just a figure on your bank statement or a blip on your ATM
screen † Like all screens it can go blank in a moment, in
a twinkling of an eye ùThe message to the bankers is
clear: You want money? Create it for nothing! People instinctively understand this which is why millions of
Argentinians cued at their ATM s waiting to get some""real
money ù(even if Mr Cavallo s corralito ù limited that to 250
pesos per week) † Fast forward eleven years to Cyprus: same
picture of people trying to withdraw 100 euros before they re all
gone 1) The private megabanker cabal uses their leverage/control over
governments and politicians so legislation is passed ensuring that
the central bank never provides the right amount of public money
the real economy of goods, services and investment needs; i e , no
credit 2) In come the private bankers, asking government: You need
money build highways, finance defense, education and health? †
No problem: we ll lend you all you want! ù 3) Government keeps borrowing and borrowing way beyond its
means 4) Bankers and politicians refinance debt again and again and
again, until it balloons way beyond repayment possibilities of the
victim nation Oh, the wonders of compound interest!! Say you re president of a country and you need to build a 100
mile road costing $ 120 000 000 over a one year period, at an
investment rate of $ 10 000 000 per month to pay for steel, cement,
constructors, architects, workers, etc † Everything is set to
go; you have two options: Option 1:Ask private bankers to loan you $ 120 000 000
at, say, 10% interest which means you are indebted by $
132 000 000 The bankers funding you will, no doubt, impose certain
conditions like you re having to use such and such a construction
company, insurer, consultant, cement, steel
providers Final cost: probably closer to $ 140 to 150 million †
Irresponsible modern politicians will of course just dump that debt
into the federal deficit black hole † Let the next president
or prime minister tackle it! Meanwhile, compound interest makes the debt grow and grow and
grow: music to mega bankers ears! Even more stupid: for a country like Argentina the loan will be
in Dollars even though everything they need to build the highway 
cement, steel, architects, workers is available locally and could
be paid in local pesos Final Result: Public indebtedness in foreign currency in an
amount 40 or 50% more than actually needed, that will continue to
grow under compound interest Option 2:You order your central bank to issue $
10 000 000 per month for 12 months in local currency † This
may have a temporary inflationary effect that is immediately offset
because government recovers tranches of that money through taxes
that cement, steel and service providers start paying to your tax
office, plus labor dues paid by workers † You repeat this for
the 2nd, 3rd, 4th months until the 12th month when the highway is
finished † Final equation: a good part of the currency issued
immediately flowed back to your tax office (who can take it out of
circulation), and the rest that remained † in circulation can
be recovered longer term through road tolls † In fact most of
it will be absorbed by increased demand emanating from real
economic growth generated by the new highway (gas stations, diners,
new towns, etc ) Benefits:you did it with your local currency at ZERO
INTEREST † If you do your homework right, the temporary
transitional inflationary effect can be duly neutralized †
Final Public Debt: Zero Now, you be the judge: what s better, financing with public
currency issued under a sovereign model, or with private banking
money that makes sovereign debt grow way beyond your means, leading
to inevitable Sovereign Debt crises in country after country; not
by mistake but by design That is what megabankers want in terms of money, and that is
what the Global Power Elite seeks because public debt ensures full
control of countries † To add insult to injury, when bankers
really screw things up as in 2008, government and media tell that
we must save those nice banks because they re too big to
fail ù † You put your money in a Cyprus bank? Sorry you ll
have to chip in with 20, 50 or 100 percent of it to save the
bankers Now do we understand what s behind this whole diabolical,
perverse, fraudulent and immoral Sovereign Debt Crisis system? Adrian Salbuchi for RT Adrian Salbuchi is a political analyst, author, speaker and

"8 Jan, 2013",Europe of discord: What will become with euro in 2013?,"As the European debt crisis shows no signs of ending experts are divided on whether the Eurozone is doomed or the project is viable, even if some of its member drop out of the euro The eurozone is headed for deeper, more intense, and much less retractable trouble in 2013 There is no foreseeable way for the region to recover as it exists today in its current form, ù economic expert Margaret Bogenrief from ACM Partners told RT With Greece s exit from the Eurozone looming and a lack of agreement between EU leaders on crisis fighting measures, the region s economy was on the verge of collapse several times last year Root of the Greece In 2012 America s Citigroup raised the chances of Greece leaving the euro in the next year to 90% Over the next few years, the euro area end game is likely to be a mix of EMU exit (Greece), a significant amount of sovereign debt and bank debt restructuring (Portugal, Ireland and, eventually, perhaps Italy, Spain and Cyprus) with only limited fiscal burden sharing, ù Citigroup said in its July report Since 2009 when Greece s economy began falling apart under its huge debt burden the country has been dependent on international rescue loans with a total of 240 billion provided to Athens As of now, 149 billion have been distributed to Greece from the Troika of international lenders That hardly solves all of Greece s problems, and experts seriously considered the scenario of Greece s default and probable exit from the Eurozone According to the ECB it would be manageable but very expensive, not only for the crisis troubled country, but for the whole region It would be associated with a loss of growth and higher unemployment and it would be very expensive in Greece, Europe as a whole and even in Germany, ù ECB policymaker Joerg Asmussen said in August His view is echoed by economic experts Despite Greece receiving a commitment of 2 bailouts (totaling 240 bn euro from the EU, European Commission, and IMF), an implementation of strict austerity measures, and the Eurozone s agreement to cut the country s debts by a further 40bn euro, Greece s debt to GDP level is still predicted, as a best case scenario in 2020, to hit 124%, Bogenrief told RT She added: The EU has stretched itself to its near limit (in particular by having to request aid for outside sources, such as the IMF) merely keeping Greece (the 15th largest economy in the EU) within its economic borders By the end of the year Greece managed to gain back investor confidence Standard & Poor s ratings agency upgraded Greece s credit grade to a B , the highest since June 2011, although the bonds are still at junk status Athens successfully accomplished a bond buyback, and reduced its debt by 20 billion Trying to hold control of the economy at the end of 2012 Greece adopted a 2013 budget that involves 9 4 billion of spending cuts, mainly in state wages, pensions and benefits, all of which have already been significantly reduced over the past two years The decision resulted in strikes and protest across the country Tough austerity measures have also led to a drastic surge of unemployment † in the third quarter of 2012 it reached a record 24 8%, up from 17 7% during the same period in 2011 Greece s neighbor Cyprus also found itself on the verge of default, crippled by the losses on Greek bonds S&P slashed Cyprus credit rating by two notches to CCC+ last December Cyprus s request for an EU bail out, which could amount to 17 5 billion, will be considered by eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on 21 January Cyprus s President has already said the international aid could cost the country its financial sovereignty Earlier in 2012 the island nation got a 2 5 billion loan from the Russian government Then three major companies provided the government with a 175m loan to stay afloat European creditors EU, IMF and ECB, said they consider a further reduction of Greece s debt if the country manages to achieve a significant primary surplus by 2016 Earlier they agreed to cut Greece s debt by 40 billion, reducing it to 124% of GDP by 2020 from around 190% in 2013 Hard times not over Europe saw its public debt reach 90% of the value of the union s economy at the end of the second quarter of 2012, according to the data provided by Eurostat Meanwhile the total jobless rate in the eurozone reached a record high of 11 7%, meaning 19 million people in the bloc were out of work with Southern member countries among the worst affected Experts warn that though the situation in Greece is under better control now, the crisis still poses risk to euro stability Unfortunately, the eurozone crisis is likely to remain with us for years to come, sustaining the likelihood of coercive debt restructurings and eurozone exits, ù Nouriel Roubini, a professor at NYU s Stern School of Business wrote in his article for Project Syndicate in December The fundamental crisis of the eurozone has not been resolved, and another year of muddling through could revive these risks in a more virulent form in 2014 and beyond, ù Roubini said, citing Grexit and probable massive loss of market access in Italy and Spain So far the debt stricken countries are determined to continue unpopular austerity reforms which have already resulted in mass protests across Southern Europe throughout 2012 The looming multi billion bailout for Spain, Europe s fourth largest economy, has become a major headache for the eurozone Last September Spain announced its plan for drastic economic reform, and a tight 2013 budget which includes 58% spending cuts and 42% increase in taxes As the Spanish crisis spread several regions asked for bailout, while Catalonia, the country s richest region accounting for fifth of GDP turned down participation in the liquidity fund, ù the 18bn euro body set up by Madrid to finance troubled regions and called for independence Saving the euro In 2012 eurozone countries managed to agree on two ambitious initiatives aimed at keeping the Eurozone afloat the establishment of a European stabilization fund and a banking union The two instruments will be operational in various spheres: the European stabilizing fund will offer help to weak economies pumping money from the strong ones EU has also agreed to appoint the ECB the single regulator for the biggest banks in the euro zone as a step towards a banking union, or common euro area approach to dealing with failing banks The only thing which European politicians do not want to do is to let debt stricken countries carry out free floating However, here they are pursuing their selfish interests, Chief of the Analytical Department of the IK Grandis Capital Denis Barabanov told the Voice of Russia The strong countries of the eurozone are getting big preferences and advantages as the members of the eurozone because on the one hand, they are killing rivalry in weaker countries and on the other hand, they always have a reliable and profitable commodity market, which enables them to sell highly competitive goods within the framework of their union, Barabanov said With all the efforts, even optimistic experts don t expect the Europe s economy to recover in the near future † In its new paper New Recession in the Eurozone ù S&P rating agency suggests the eurozone GDP will shrink by 0 8% in 2012 Growth in 2013 is expected to be zero compared to the earlier forecast of up 0 3%, according to the study Splitting the eurozone is still considered to be an option by some experts Billionaire George Soros proposed Germany, Europe s so far best performing economy, should leave to save the Eurozone, among other options The problem would disappear into thin air, as the value of the euro declines and yields on the bonds of debtor countries adjust, CNBC quoted Soros as saying On the other hand, euro sceptic and financial consultant Stephan Werhahn, grandson of a statesman seen as the architect of the EU, believes the euro should be limited to a handful of similar northern European countries, the Daily Mail reports Europe will fail if debt stricken countries are forced to stick with the euro, Werhahn said However, Italy, Greece and Spain are very unlikely to leave the Eurozone, according to Maksim Zaytsev, senior analyst at Nord Capital Group They have made significant progress over the recent months in reducing their budget deficit, ù Zaytsev told RT Now their budget gaps are lower than 9% † a critical level when countries face problems with debt refunding ùThe ECB has also contributed to easing the situation in Europe, he added ECB launched a bond buying program which also supported debt markets, ù Zaytsev said This program allows the ECB to buy bonds without limits while setting aside some funds to avert a risk of inflation ù † The 700bn euro European Stability mechanism is also very important as it de facto issues euro bonds supported

"16 Oct, 2012",Germany should take the lead or leave the euro altogether ‚Äì Soros,"Germany should leave the euro that s one of the recipes billionaire George Soros proposed for the debt ridden European economies to overcome the crisis The problem would disappear into thin air, as the value of the euro declines and yields on the bonds of debtor countries adjust, CNBC quotes Soros as saying Another option involves Germany accepting greater commitment to helping not only its interests but the interests of the debtor countries, and playing the role of the benevolent hegemon, Soros added Sharing the risks equally among the EU member states by issuing euro bonds, where one country takes up a certain portion of the debt of its co members, could prove to be a good way for the troubled economies to get out of the debt path, he said So, Germany just needs to support the euro bond plan, as if it successful, it would cost very little, but if it fails, it would drag down Germany, Soros explained Germany, an economic locomotive for troubled Europe, is currently in a wrangle with its southern neighbours, who appear to be reluctant to become more financially disciplined Earlier Germany questioned Greece s need for more time to fulfill the austerity promises given in return for financial aid from the bloc This added to the fears that Athens could leave the eurozone, something largely unwelcomed among monetary authorities Another heavy cloud is hanging over Spain which despite pressure from EU member states has so far decided not to ask for financial aid The country is reportedly afraid of the strings attached to any bailout from the Eurozone People in Germany are increasingly against any additional aid to the indebted economies The income tax in Germany, that follows a progressive tax scheme, sometimes goes up as high as 45% A progressive tax means that the exact portion of one s income to be paid to the budget goes up together with one s welfare ",https://www.rt.com/business/let-germany-euro-soros-551/
"26 Jun, 2012",Latin America: Is ‚ÄúArab Spring‚Äù coming to town? (Op-Ed),"A wave of protests have rolled across Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia countries taking a strong stance against the US and its allies policies in the region Are we witnessing a Latin American Spring ù? Whilst engineering violent insurgency does not yet seem to be on the † agenda of the Global Power Masters, there are indications of growing PsyWar activity by pro democracy ù, pro human rights ù, aid ù agencies and NGO s acting through local players aligned to US/UK/EU interests Lighting the match Is this paving the way for far worse things to come? Those who light the match ù that fires popular protests and unrest have learned only too well from their Arab Spring ù experience how to fan those flames into catastrophic social wildfires Some alarm bells are beginning to go off in countries like Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, whose presidents † Hugo Ch vez, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales, respectively † are not playing to the tune played by the US and its allies, who for over a century have exerted economic colonial domination over Latin America Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador insist in maintaining close relations with countries the US and its allies have branded as rogue states ù, notably, Iran, Syria and, until Muammar Gaddafi s public murder, Libya † Have they been thus earmarked to become beachheads for a coming Latin American Spring ù of engineered insurrection?The so called Arab Spring ù too began by fanning the flames of a wide assortment of popular grievances that grew into mass demonstrations that quickly escalated into uncontrolled social violence on all sides A sign that this kind of match ù is being lit can be seen in Ecuador where Quito newspaper El Tel√©grafo ù revealed that a so called Active Citizenry Project ù to train opposition journalists ù is getting 4 3 million dollars in funds from USAID the United States Agency for International Development, who also funnel funds to local opposition groups like Faro and Fundamedios with the declared excuse of strengthening democracy ù through workshops, forums, and media surveillance projects Webs of power To understand how this complex domination system really works, we also need to look at private sector activity, which is instrumental in achieving control over countries in the region For example, a private entity like the Rockefeller led Americas Society ù strongly linked to the Council on Foreign Relations lying just across the street from them on New York City s plush Park Avenue was recently able to catapult one if its members, Juan Manuel Santos, to become president of Colombia, a traditional US ally in the region Other Americas Society members include powerful regional and global business and political leaders, like World Jewish Congress chairman Eduardo Elsztain (George Soros Argentine business partner) and Gustavo and Patricia Cisneros owners of a powerful Venezuelan opposition multi media conglomerate Co chairing the America s Society with David Rockefeller is John Negroponte, who served as George W Bush s ambassador to the UN and Iraq, and was also his National Security Advisor † Often, it is little known facts like these that help join the dots ù to get the real picture of where power lies, but which the Western mainstream media all but ignore Just as they ignored the fact that the Global Power Masters imposed Mario Monti as president of troubled Italy who also happens ù to be European Chairman for the Rockefeller Rothschild Trilateral Commission with its large mega banker membership Thankfully, the world is waking up to the fact that the so called Arab Spring ù is nothing more than a vehicle to impose Western style democracy ù throughout the Muslim world, thereby weakening all sovereign states Clearly, this is being engineered, financed and abetted by the Power Elite s shrewdly taking advantage of internal divisions and hijacking genuine grievances of local populations to their advantage They use all the weapons at their disposal † often through CIA, MI6 and Mossad operatives † This includes global and local media PsyWar that spreads false/distorted information about what s really happening in each country and why Seven Step Guide to country destruction Writing in RT last year on the Arab Spring ù, we described a Seven Step process whereby the Western Powers can escalate turmoil into outright destruction † Since clouds are gathering over Latin America and other regions, we would do well to review this process:1 They begin by targeting a country ripe for regime change ù, often branding it a Rogue State ù; then 2 They spread flagrant lies through their news media and paid journalists and call it the International Community s Concern ù, then 3 They finance and promote internal turmoil and strife, often escalating it to arming and training local terrorist groups by CIA, MI6, Mossad, Al Qaeda and drug cartel recruits, and call them Freedom Fighters ù; then 4 They try to stage mock UN Security Council Resolutions allowing NATO to rain death and destruction over millions of people, and call it Sanctions to Protect Civilians ù; then 5 They invade and begin controlling the target country, and call it Liberation ù; then 6 When the target country falls under their control, they fraudulently impose treacherous caretaker governments and call it Democracy ù, until finally 7 They steal the victim country s oil, mineral and agricultural wealth handing it over to the Corporate and Banking Overworld, also imposing unnecessary Sovereign Debts, and call it Foreign Investment and Reconstruction ù So, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia even Argentina: open your eyes! † Learn to see through the violent use of force in private and hypocrisy in public by the Power Elite Because the day the Global Power Masters decide to come for you, they will say it s all in the name of freedom of speech ù, democracy ù, peace ù, human rights ù, non discrimination ù and other catch phrases Don t fall for it!

"25 Jun, 2012",Soros: Merkel is leading Europe in the wrong direction,"Billionaire investor George Soros called on Europe to set up a fund to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, saying that a failure by leaders meeting this week to produce drastic measures could be fatal Policy makers are at an impasse as they prepare to meet in Brussels on June 28 29 That risks disaster because Europe is running out of time to show investors it will do what s necessary to save the euro, Soros said † There is a disagreement on the fiscal side Unless that is resolved in the next three days, then I am afraid the summit could turn out to be a fiasco That could actually be fatal ùA European Fiscal Authority should be created to purchase sovereign debt in return for Italy and Spain committing to budget cuts, Soros said in an interview with Bloomberg Television †Funding for the purchases would come from the sale of European Treasuries, which would have low yields because they would be backed by each euro member, he said France and Italy are calling on Germany to take action to put an end to the debt crisis after Spain s 10 year bond yields jumped to more than 7 percent last week, a level that economists consider unsustainable Beyond 7 percent, Greece, Portugal and Ireland struggled to raise cash in the market and were forced to seek financial support Earlier German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was against premature ù proposals for issuing euro area bonds, arguing that such debt can t be sold until there is a full fiscal union for the region †Germany has also demanded that Greece, the recipient of a 240 billion ($300 billion) rescue, and other indebted countries implement budget cuts in return for rescue funds needed to make their bond payments † Merkel has emerged as a strong leader, ù Soros said Unfortunately, she has been leading Europe in the wrong direction ùAntonis Samaras, sworn in as Greece s Prime Minister on June 20, has pledged to seek relief from austerity measures imposed on the country while keeping the bailout funds flowing It is very hard to see how Greece can actually meet the conditions that have been set, ù Soros said The Germans are absolutely determined not to modify those conditions One has to now calculate on Greece being forced out of the euro ùUnder Soros s plan, outlined in a paper he s sent to EU leaders, bonds sold by the European Fiscal Authority would receive a zero risk weighting from regulators, allowing the European Central Bank to treat them as the highest quality collateral That would boost demand for banks to buy the securities and ensure that their yields would be less than 1 percent, a more sustainable level than the rates Spain and Italy pay today, he said Neither Spain nor Italy has the ability to print money ù because they are both members of the euro, making it likelier that financial markets can push one of them out of the bloc, Soros said Spain is likely to need a full bailout unless leaders announce drastic measures at the meeting, he added ",https://www.rt.com/business/merkel-is-leading-europe-in-the-wrong-direction-660/
"5 Jun, 2012",Crisis countdown: 90 days to sort the euro disaster,"If the eurozone does not agree on the way out of the crisis within three months it could eventually turn into a German empire with the periphery as the hinterland, ù billionaire investor George Soros warns Germany will struggle to preserve the euro as a single currency, as a breakup would have dramatic effects both economically and politically, George Soros said Economically, a euro split would mean huge claims against the periphery economies, with the Bundesbank alone having over a 1 trillion in claims That s without any intergovernmental obligations On top of that, a return to the Deutschemark would likely price Germany out of its export markets not to mention the political consequences, ù Soros added In the end, all the effort from Berlin would result in a eurozone dominated by Germany in which the divergence between the creditor and debtor countries would continue to widen and the periphery would turn into permanently depressed areas in need of constant transfer of payments ùThe statement came as Soros warned of a narrow three months window remaining to save the euro and bring the eurozone back to the shape it was when created The monetary union needs to agree on the way out of the crisis before its locomotive economy Germany falls into a downturn itself, he said Given the increasing tension in Greece, which has so far failed to form a government capable of meeting the EU terms, the Greek crisis is liable to come to a climax in the fall, ù Soros said By that time the German economy will also be weakening so Chancellor Merkel will find it even more difficult than today to persuade the German public to accept any additional European responsibilities That is what creates a three months window, ù the investor explained The German economy has started to ring alarm bells, posting a marginal downturn, according to a May PMI report for the eurozone released on Tuesday an indicator of business activity in the area The Final Eurozone Composite Output Index fell to 46 0 in May from its April reading of 46 7 Any figure below 50 points to an economic contraction German output fell for the first time since last November and, although only modest, the rate of decline was the fastest for almost three years, ù the PMI report said The April data on the change in the volume of industrial orders to be released on Tuesday is also expected to be far from rosy, says Pavel Emelyantsev from Investcafe Experts sentiment is quite negative, as they expect the number to drop 0 9% month to month, which compares to the growth of 2 2% in March In annual terms the drop in April will stand at 3 8% ",https://www.rt.com/business/euro-save-soros-germany-014/

"16 Aug, 2011",Merkel and Sarkozy propose euro-zone ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù to tackle debt crisis,"Germany and France are calling on all euro zone members to enshrine a balanced budget in their constitution, as well proposing a collective government ù led by the EU president In one of the most dramatic expansions of state power since the onset of the EU debt crisis, France and Germany have proposed a united euro zone government to guide the bloc s finances as well as having power to overrule national governments The new collective economic government would be lead by Herman Van Rompuy and consist of heads of state or government that would meet at least twice a year We want to express our absolute will to defend the euro and assume Germany and France s particular responsibilities in Europe and to have on all of these subjects a complete unity of views, ù said Sarkozy The Franco German tandem, who represent the euro zone s two largest economies, have also proposed to unite the corporation taxes of two countries A tax on financial transactions have also been announced According to Angela Merkel this is being done in order to harmonize economies and taxes across Europe Nicholas Sarkozy faces an election next year, where he is already trailing behind his rivals, and many suspect that those announcements might make him even more unpopular in his country Opinion polls show that people in Europe do not want closer integration Merkel and Sarkozy have dismissed the use of Eurobonds, which many have said would be the solution to Eurozone s economic problems They have said that Eurobonds are not a solution, they are not a cure ù and France and Germany will not guarantee other country s debt, they refuse to bail out the rising problems in countries like Italy and Spain Meanwhile, influential investors like George Soros are supporting the Eurobonds, saying the only solution for such weak countries as Portugal and Greece is to leave the euro The problem is that Germany has already been sucked into the crisis itself with its economic growth skidding to a halt in the second three months of the year It s economy grew by just 0 1 per cent in the second quarter, while the French economy stagnated Finance professor Marco Becht from the Solvay Brussels School says that none of the proposals made today by Angela Merkel and Nikolas Sarkozy will have a positive impact on the euro zone crisis We were not surprised by anything that was said, ù he said What markets are looking for is the actual implementation of the decisions that were taken in July, which is mostly loading up the European financial stability mechanism with money, so it can become operational and purchase bonds in the secondary markets ù Meanwhile, the chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, Philippe Waechter, says that if the proposed euro zone government ù is indeed created, Europe s leading economy will have to make serious concessions Germany will not be the chief, ù he stated We will have to share all things, because we will succeed only if we all go together in the same direction ù And Scheherazade Rehman, a professor of business and international affairs at George Washington University, says the decisions taken at the meeting reflect only the political aspirations of German and French leaders, and not market demands † Unfortunately, this is not going to make much difference for the ongoing crisis, ù she told RT All the news that came out from this news conference is quite negative for the market The most negative was the fact that it was announced that the European fund for stabilization facility the bailout fund for the euro zone members will not be expanded The second thing: there is no common Eurobond that was going to be issued, and they were very clear about it and the markets were not expecting this Other bad news for the market was that taxation is going to go up ù So, the European leaders have done it again they have not really addressed the market s needs for clear concise action, but what they are doing instead is looking at the long term political solution to the dilemma that they have, ù concluded Rehman Financial writer Peter Bild argues that economically and politically, what the two leaders have done is basically the right thing, or at least a step in the right direction † There is no quick fix, ù he told RT The only quick fix is the one that the Central Bank or the stability fund that s been set up in the euro zone can possibly handle In other words, they can manipulate the market, but the essential problem is not the question of market manipulation It is fundamentally the question of the huge debts that are being run up, in some cases not even willfully but in response to a huge economic downturn, which means that countries revenues have fallen and, as things stand right now, I can t see any end to it We are seeing that all of Europe is slowing down, and that means that probably deficits will increase and not decrease ù † In the end, if you are hugely in debt, it is your creditor who tells you what you can and what you can t do, ù Bild stated Parliaments may not like it, but in the end, if the budgets are not harmonized, if they are not done in accordance with rules which limit how much debt you can run up, then of course the creditors are simply not going to give you any money Now, if you accept that you do need money, then you are also going to have to accept the rules and possibly the loss of some so called sovereignty ù ",https://www.rt.com/news/merkel-sarkozy-eurobonds-eu/
"15 Aug, 2011",Dining on the Euro‚Äôs near death experience,"Take a currency, one widely used as a reserve currency, including by Russia, and expose it to the blowtorch of market examination of its fundamentals It isn t pretty, and the Euro may be gone soon, if it the debt issue isn t comprehensively addressed On the Menu memories of fellow leaders pastTomorrow s meeting between Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy will go a long way to determining the future of the Euro The simple question on the menu is whether they can put together the politics to save the Euro The politics isn t easy Almost every European leader from Papandreou in Greece, to the leaders in Ireland and Portugal who have introduced austerity, before heading to the electoral dustbin barely avoiding being tarred and feathered by their not so thankful electorates, and Spain where the election has been called, through to Berlusconi in Italy where the austerity is about to unfold, has shown where the politics is profoundly difficult But the finances are equally so After the bailout of Greece (twice) Ireland and Portugal the existing EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility), which was setup with a 440 billion now needs to encompass the possibility of coming to the aid of Spain, Italy, almost certainly Cyprus (which seems to have gone under the radar, but has a banking sector far bigger than its size would indicate and is surprisingly closely tied to Russia) and maybe other needs far more Italy and Spain alone have an estimated 2 2 Trillion in outstanding debt compared to 630 billion for the nations which have already received bailouts Settling past billsThe initial EFSF is built up through loans from existing Eurozone nations, plus a dollop from the IMF The nations contributing to it included those receiving bailouts, with nearly 1/3 coming from nations which have either received bailouts, or like Italy and Spain, are in the firing line That leaves any potential expansion in the hands of the larger or more solvent players, making France and Germany the twin pillars in terms of providing for its enlargement to 2 Trillion, with the need for their contributions to an enlarged EFSF already being factored in by markets, which explains in part some of the tremors in CDS swaps across the Eurozone in recent weeks They are starting to question even the AAA rated nations of the Eurozone and the implications of what is potentially a massive additional debt servicing need by them, in order to ensure an adequate bailout for the whole Eurozone To put that in context for theses nations it tends to represent an additional 14 20% of their standing debt, or generally adding about 8% of debt to GDP to their load Then there are additional concerns with any and every potential bond purchase part of the EFSF, with questions over coupon values, durations, interest rates, and net present values, not to mention how they get accounted for by the nations receiving funds, and how the EFSF marks these to market Dealing with haughty waitersThe other key factor in the malaise is the structure of the EFSF and its management It currently revolves around sovereign debt issues if the Eurozone nations individually, and is managed by the ECB The ECB has been buying bonds of the bailed out nations, plus those, belatedly, of Spain and Italy last week, while at the same time imposing a hard core dose of austerity every time upon the nations, as the price for stepping into the market Arguments rage back and forth, but there is certainly a case for thinking that in some cases the austerity involved is not just making the life harder in these nations, but largely ensuring they will not see any real economic growth for some time, and as a result further eroding their capacity to service their existing debt Against a backdrop of the ECB widely being seen as a key factor, through tightening rates too early and too far, in turning an nascent economic recovery into a near certain recession across much of the Eurozone, that is generating plenty of tension from aggrieved politicians having to tout austerity to those who vote for them at the behest of appointed officials Silvio Berlusconi s comments about bleeding hearts and looking like an occupied government, in the wake of getting the Italian parliament to agree to austerity measures on Friday encapsulates a mood which resonates strongly in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain Palatable and unpalatableThe meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel is expected to see the French leader push for the Eurozone to issue bonds backed by all 17 member nations This would effectively entail the Eurozone developing the fiscal side critics have always maintained it lacks to go with its monetary side Supporting the contention is the fact that the need to contribute to the EFSF and its enlargement is actually corroding market confidence in the stronger nations, as seen in the market treatment of French banks and French debt in the last week That brings us back to another round of ugly politics Germans aren t terribly enthused about the prospect of bailing out their southern neighbours, and there is a constitutional challenge in Germany to the existing bailout German resistance to any form of sharing responsibility for sovereign debts of other nations is profound, with Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble stating again on the weekend that There is no collectivisation of debt or unlimited support Germans are also aware that any thought of freeing the ECB from its need to sterilize its bond purchases and head off to flood money markets while buying distressed Euro sovereign debt could be highly inflationary, and potentially destabilizing for a nation which has prided itself on rock solid finances given that it would be required to provide most of the firepower enabling it to happen The collection of centre right parties which comprise the majority in the Bundestag haven t been backward in denouncing any hint of easing up for their European neighbours, giving Chancellor Merkel precious little political leeway Dessert anyone?But writing in the Financial Times on August 14, George Soros sums up the vital role of Germany, and the need for Europe to be able to convince Germany to change its approach if the Eurozone is to survive Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany, and because eurobonds will put Germany s credit standing at risk, any compromise must put Germany in the driver s seat Sadly, Germany has unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy, and it wants Europe to follow its example But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe: no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits Germany must agree to rules by which others can also abide ùThe other side of the equation is that flooding the markets with money, would potentially generate growth in the Eurozone which would lighten the debt servicing issue for those currently looking at exporting people due to the lack of opportunities at home Currently the ECB doesn t have the scope for the scale of purchases needed, while ensuring these are sterilized So that leaves the Eurozone wondering if Sarkozy and Merkel can come to agreement on allowing the ECB to proceed with unsterilized debt purchases, agreeing to issue Eurobonds which would be heavily reliant on Germany, or if they can come up with a system or general idea which they can sell to politicians and publics across the EU that involves fiscal transfers, joint responsibility for existing debts, and will calm markets For if they come out with nothing more than glib statements, or more of the same it is a recipe for Euro and market chaos James BlakeRT Business Internet

"13 Jul, 2011",‚ÄúHundreds of billions in drug money pumped into banks during crisis‚Äù,"The head of Russia s Federal Drug Control Service Viktor Ivanov told RT how the problem is being tackled in the country and worldwide, and how those profiting from the addiction resist this effort RT: According to official statistics, more than 7,000 people have died in Russia from drug related deaths since the beginning of this year At the same time, others are saying that this number is actually more than 100,000 people How come there is such a huge difference in numbers? Viktor Ivanov: You see, the figure of 7,000 dead reflects only the number of people who actually died from drug poisoning That is, they took such huge doses that their organisms failed A total majority of drug abusers, however, die not from overdosing; they do know how to measure their doses The reason for most drug related deaths is internal organ failure due to regular consumption RT: Unfortunately, Russia is now the world s third most heroin consuming country after Afghanistan and Iraq Some people, such as Mr Gryzlov, propose life sentences for drug abusers, while others propose the death penalty What is your position? VI: We have proposed a bill on differentiating responsibility, and it has been upheld by the government According to it, individuals selling large shipments of drugs will be in for more severe punishment, all the way up to a life sentence For people not involved in gross drug related crimes, we are considering alternative responsibility, which means offering them an option of taking a therapy course instead of punishment RT: There is information that of all the heroin coming into Russia, only 10% is intercepted and confiscated Why is border control so ineffective and can this be fixed? VI: These figures are, in fact, common for the whole world I mean, police all over the world, be it Europeans or Americans, only manage to confiscate around 10% of drugs illegally traded within their countries Another thing is that the extremely low efficiency of our borders and their administrative and legal mode of operation lead to the fact that only 0 2% of all drugs are intercepted at the borders Drugs that get to Russia first have to go through the states of Central Asia, and they are not intercepted here Those states are themselves, above all, victims of Afghanistan s enormous drug production As a matter of fact, Afghanistan itself is largely the victim of the global drug mafia, which forms the demand and the political will to continue production in this country This is why countries adjacent to Afghanistan have the greatest density of drug flow: simply because they are closer to the epicenter Further away, the drug flow ramifies into lots of different channels and then drugs get to Russia, for example, through the 7,000 kilometer border with Kazakhstan RT: What synthetic drugs are brought in from Europe? VI: Over 80% of all synthetic substances illegally traded in Russia originate in Europe Mostly it s the Netherlands, where most amphetamine based drugs are manufactured, Poland, Baltic States, Germany, Bulgaria, and many other countries with undercover drug labs The labs themselves are small, but there are many of them, and the substances they produce find their way to Russia via various channels † Speaking of the amounts that we intercept and confiscate, it s nearly half a ton of synthetic substances a year Mostly those are methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, and other drugs RT: You have been speaking in favor of testing schoolchildren for drugs Do you think that parents should be tested for drugs as well, because some say that second or third grade kids first get exposed to drugs through their parents?VI: Well, you know, testing people en masse would be way too radical No, of course not We are talking about establishing an early warning system to detect drug addicts and drug abusers After all, people are not born addicted to drugs It all starts with experimenting, mostly at teenage age, when kids start spending more and more time on the streets, away from their parents That s when they get to know drugs If this is detected at an early stage and if parents are warned in advance, sometimes it takes just parental attention and parental advice to put an end to those dangerous experiments If not stopped in time, those experiments later lead to regular consumption, which in turn requires longer and costlier treatment RT: Do you find forced treatment admissible?VI: No We are not talking about forced treatment here Any forced treatment is a violation of a person Therefore it s important that drug abusers make this decision themselves In our country, drug abuse is subject to administrative liability and punishment of paying a fine, on average 600 rubles [$21] They re punished, and then they re released Therefore, our society seems to hope that drug abusers will somehow realize that they require treatment for this addiction However they will not realize this, as their mind is blurred by chemical injections of psychoactive substances Therefore, a legal system should be created to push them toward having to undergo treatment As I ve said, this is the so called alternative responsibility By the way, this is also recommended in the UN anti drugs fundamental conventions RT: The Global Commission on Drug Policy called the war on drugs a failure Do you agree?VI: This Global Commission has nothing to do with the UN Perhaps a lot of media was tempted, or provoked by the presence of the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in this commission I have to say that we denied this kind of conclusion, and so did my colleagues in the US Russia Presidential Commission Mr Gil Kerlikowske made a harsh statement; we discussed it immediately with Washington over the hotline, and criticized this global commission Legalizing drugs is a road to nowhere Moreover, it will result in a boost of drug abuse Let me remind you of a referendum on legalizing marijuana in California in September last year I was there in the midst of this LA referendum where we decided with Mr Gil Kerlikowske at a number of meetings with officials, including the mayor, the sheriff, the chief of police, the prosecutor All these respectable professionals had a clear standing against legalizing marijuana And the referendum confirmed that it should not be legalized RT: In your opinion, why would you say some people would find it profitable to lobby for drugs? For example you ve said that George Soros has essentially sponsored a drug campaign in California VI: I have explicit information from the US Presidential Administration that this financier had largely funded this campaign RT: Is there such thing as drug lobbying? Who would be a point for such a lobby to exist?VI: Yes, certainly this example of the Global Commission reminds me of a global PR campaign by drawing so much attention that even such a respectable agency like the BBC covered the fact that this commission belongs to the UN I mean, even such serious agencies were led to confusion Therefore there are all reasons to believe that this drug lobbying had funded this kind of speech Moreover, I wanted to indicate what we ve been discussing at various international platforms On May 10, I spoke at the G8 s Ministerial conference in Paris, and so did many of my colleagues We said that unfortunately our fight against drugs stagnates at both local and regional levels, whereas the global level stays even beyond our understanding This concept hasn t been developed yet In this context, I want to note that the former Under Secretary General of the UN Antonio Costa who was responsible for the drug problem mentioned that in 2008 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, US$352 billion from selling drugs was pumped into the world s leading banks This means that a certain global level determines or sets the demand for drugs turnover, and ultimately, a political order for this production RT: Do you think that the situation related to trade in drugs, including those produced in Afghanistan, will change after US and NATO troops pull out from Afghanistan? VI: As far as the withdrawal from Afghanistan is concerned, the picture is unclear so far It was said that the withdrawal would start and certain parameters for it had been set They ve mentioned 30,000 troops at the end of the year But when I was in Washington last September they were talking about the need to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan exactly by 30,000 Now, they are planning to return these 30,000 So, in fact, nothing has changed I think that the world community, and you will find it hard to disagree, is beginning to reconsider the situation in Afghanistan because there were several reasons behind the decision to launch a military operation and the decision of the world community to interfere in the internal affairs of this country: first, to put an end to the Taliban rule, to set up interim administration and hold free elections Those tasks were supposed to be completed in six or 12 months at least This September will see the tenth anniversary of that interference It s longer than World War II But the situation in Afghanistan hasn t improved, it has become even worse And even senior officials like General Petraeus, for example, who commanded the military operation in Afghanistan, says that the number of armed clashes there increases year after year In fact, the number of armed clashes over the past ten years has increased more than a hundred times So have the assigned tasks been achieved? We see that security in Afghanistan has only got worse It s said that drugs production cannot be fought because it damages the security situation in the country So, it s a kind of closed circle In this respect, it would be noteworthy to recall a NATO operation in Helmand province, which produces the greatest amount of opium poppy The operation was called Äòmashtarak which, if translated from Persian, means Äòtogether  The operation was presented as a brilliant military success Considerable kilometers and hectares of that province were reportedly cleared from insurgents but the production of opium poppy has never stopped That is why a peaceful settlement is necessary We ve started talking about this need at long last It was highlighted at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 The autumn conference in Kabul also stressed the need to find a peaceful settlement The latest initiatives voiced by US President Barack Obama on negotiations with the Taliban and the latest resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which divided responsibility between the Taliban and Al Qaeda are offering unique opportunity, in my view, to draw up a program of elimination of drugs production I ve just come from a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest faction in the European Union Here, outside the European Parliament building, we discussed the EU strategy towards Afghanistan Large sections of that strategy are devoted to liquidation of drugs production in Afghanistan The EU strategy matches very well a Russia drafted plan called ÄúRaduga 2 Äù to liquidate the production of drugs in Afghanistan In fact, the force vectors of Russia and the European Union are fitting each other very well So, today we have a unique opportunity for resolute and decisive action RT: Thank you very much for your interview VI: Thank you very much RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ÄúTV Novosti Äù, 2005 Äì2021 All rights reserved This website uses cookies Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more ",https://www.rt.com/news/hundreds-drug-money-pumped/
"16 Mar, 2009",'US uses Europe as a bridge-head to attack Eurasia',"The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics RT spoke to Graziani in Rome RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures It affects all levels of society In Italy we are seeing more support towards right wing anti immigration policies How can Italy and how can we all outlive the world financial crisis? Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and Japan This crisis has affected the whole world market As for Italy, the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010 Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium enterprises, there s no high concentration of industry, and therefore Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the crisis Anyway, the crisis will be very deep We ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a continental geo economic context It means that we should look for recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as Russia, China and India are going to have their part The crisis cannot be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in Brussels by the europeanunion only RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but still, it was among those taken hostage by it The truth has been concealed What is the real origin of the dispute? T G : The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as EU expansion into Eastern European countries These two coinciding enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close neighbourhood This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall From that moment the United States had decided to manage the whole planet They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it s known that Central Asia has huge resources of gas and oil The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its natural location, or from Moscow If we analyze the so called orangerevolution , we ll realize that behind these achievements of the so called civilsociety of Ukraine were interests coming from across the Atlantic, from Washington We mustn t also forget about the influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian republics When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo political context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it s evident that when it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other Obviously gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine s leaders lack sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests Instead of looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas designated for European nations This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press, including the Italian press In the gas dispute, the majority of Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used geo policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal economic transactions concerning gas RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year T G : I believe it s possible to find an economic agreement Moscow and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts I d like to stress again that it s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and import It s a geopolitical issue It s evident, if Ukraine chooses to set up a Western camp with Washington s leadership, that ll affect not only gas, but also other economic issues as well Hence, I believe, it ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes from Kiev, because it depends on Washington s interests RT: While we re focusing on Washington let s talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here? T G : Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but they aren t politically conscious Thus, in the case of the enlargement of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main argument was environmental And the main motive was hidden as, in reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they d have the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in Serbia, which also depends on Washington In future it ll be possible to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia The Yugoslavian nation, Serbia in this case, wasn t chosen by chance, but because it has some cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia EU relations, many EU states are already looking for alternative suppliers Does Russia need to worry? T G : No, I don t think Russia should worry about it I think every country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning energy supplies and be self sufficient In a wider geo political context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe, between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests: exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources and, obviously, cultural relations I believe cultural relations between the europeanunion and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture If we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the 1930s we ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect language with many borrowed English words It is a result of cultural colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until today It s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in the countries of the former Soviet block RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia EU relations? T G : Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the europeanunion is a potential partner of Russia But to be a real, not just potential, partner Italy should have more liberty and total political sovereignty, which it doesn t have at present I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London RT: You re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world anymore T G : I m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge head to attack the whole Eurasian ground It makes me critical, but, of course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over At present, in the 21st century, on a geo political level we have a multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some states in South America, which are also creating their own geo political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too In particular, major liberties which these South American countries enjoy can allow the europeanunion to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain RT: You travel all over Europe s hotspots and breakaway regions You were monitoring the election in Transdniester There is an island off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that s just declared independence, they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia Is there one universal formula on how to deal with separatism?T G : These issues are absolutely different In Sardinia there is a political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now As for Transdniester, it s necessary to view its situation from the geo strategic point of view The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel the weight of the United States and NATO Transdniester is one of the so called frozen conflicts I think Transdniester s independence would be interesting, because in this case it ll become an area the United States won t be able to enter It ll be a territory of liberty from the Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its sovereignty I don t analyze this republic judging it by its actual government I only analyze its geo strategic and geo political situation Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its small territory there are no NATO bases I d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula Under such conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to express their own interests in their politics and their economy But it should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well Italy is located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic position Besides, Italy s central position is also vital at a geopolitical level And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian integration I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they overcome limitations established by a political power which comes directly from Washington and London RT: You re very critical of Washington, you portray the US almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral world
