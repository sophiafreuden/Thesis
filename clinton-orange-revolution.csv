"8 May, 2019",Trump Strangelove: Or how America learned to worry and hate Empire,"President Donald Trump seems to be making Americans hate the empire again, by embracing war or maybe only pretending to do so against Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea and who knows where else One thing to keep in mind about Trump is that his critics tend to instinctively oppose anything he is for, regardless of what they may have thought in the past Take this video, for example, comparing the eerily similar rhetoric behind George W Bush s push for war against Iraq and the Trump administration s current drumbeat for war with Iran, featuring Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Trump is pushing us toward the brink of war with Iran î and it all sounds alarmingly familiar pic twitter com/iLv7Rd8bXL The twist? It was produced by MoveOn org, a Democrat activist group set up in 1998 to oppose the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and bankrolled by George Soros These are the same Democrats, mind, who did nothing to oppose Clinton s 1999 war on Yugoslavia, Obama s 2011 intervention in Libya, or the actual Iraq War for that matter But now they warn against war with Iran because Orange Man Bad! Recall, however, that Trump himself has repeatedly denounced the Iraq War and indeed, used that to bludgeon Jeb Bush during the 2015 Republican primaries, obliterating the candidate the establishment and media thought would be the front runner Then, in 2016, Trump delivered a blisteringforeign policy speechdenouncing nation building and wars of conquest around the globe in favor of America first ù Oh, the establishment in Washington wailed and gnashed their teeth, but took comfort in the knowledge that Trump could never, ever possibly be elected Every single media outlet told them so, after all And then it happened anyway Netanyahu and Trump are gearing up for Bolton s mustache with Iran, and we re all screwed pic twitter com/PIpbvm5828 When the unthinkable happened later that year, the establishment launched every possible effort to resist ùand sabotage Trump s agenda, primarily by the means of the Russiagate conspiracy theory The very Swamp ùin Washington that Trump vowed to drain went to war against anyone who might actually do it from General Michael Flynn onward while steering clear of neocon cadres like Pompeo, Bolton,Kurt VolkerorElliott Abramsthat ended up working for Trump Have you seen any of them accosted at a restaurant, or accused of a scandal in the Washington Post? Of course not This is one possible explanation for why Trump ended up embracing the neocons: they are the only ones actually willing to work in his administration Another possibility, however, is that Trump is aware the very best way to make the establishment hate a position is for him to embrace it Justin Raimondo of Antiwar com, who has watched US foreign policy closely for the past 25 years, is convinced that Trump has embraced the neocons in order toset them upfor a defeat, letting Pompeo and Bolton along with others freely indulge their fantasies of regime change in Caracas or a counter revolution in Tehran, as a way to prove his point that the American Empire he condemned in 2016 is untenable We can see the knife go in as this whole scenario plays out, ùRaimondowrote in February, as Trump embraced regime change in Venezuela Perhaps that sounds a bit too Game of Thrones , but look at what has actually happened since: each attempt by US backed interim president Juan Guaido to take power has failed more spectacularly than the previous one Also note that one of the loudest voices for regime change in Venezuela and a harder line on Cuba, Senator Marco Rubio (R Florida) repaid Trump by voting against his declaration of emergency on the US Mexico border, invoked to overcome Democrat opposition to the border wall I do question Bolton and his motives, and I do NOT want any more wars I struggle with the fact that Trump has Bolton, a well known NeoCon, in this position https:// tdotco /d3g0dIcSOB Recall how the very same media outlets that hounded Trump with the now debunked Russiagate conspiracysang praisesto the beauty of our weapons ùwhen the president fired off some missiles into Syria, to ensure he stays the Assad must go ùcourse While the State Department rhetoric on that has not changed, Trump did order US troops out of Syria and that actually happened,more or less, suggesting that Washington has tacitly given up on regime change in Damascus Of course, this could all be Q level speculation about 4 D chess ùIt is entirely possible that Trump has simply been seduced by the neocon siren call of perpetual war and the American Empire, despite consistently expressed beliefs to the contrary over a long period of time If there is one thing that s been absolutely certain about the Trump presidency so far, it s that the only way to know for sure is to see what happens Nebojsa Malic, for RT ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/458688-trump-neocons-iran-venezuela/
"6 Nov, 2018","‚ÄòThey came in the same old way‚Äô: In the midterms, echoes of 2016","The 2018 US midterm elections are shaping up to be not just a rematch of the 2016 presidential race but a rerun, as Democrats and the media seem determined to repeat the same mistakes that produced the presidency of Donald Trump Just look at the headlines,the polls, and the talking heads on television Doesn t this remind you of 2016? Once again, celebrities and late night show hosts are beseeching their fans to vote, while newspapers pen fawning pieces about Democrats making history, ùthe inevitability of the Blue Wave, ùand theracist, racist, RACISTnature of every Republican ever, especially Trump Vote like the authoritarian president is a racist sexual predator who colluded with Russia and won t show his taxes and violates the emoluments clause and incites nazi terrorism but the GOP is complicit and the media is distracted so it s up to us to save the god damn country The only thing that has changed is that most media outlets which had overwhelmingly endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 don t even bother hiding their preferences Everything is out in the open now, stripped of all pretense and posturing Ironically, that is one of the effects of the Trump presidency Much like the armies that are always studying how to re fight the last war, US politicians appear to be obsessed with re fighting the last election Both major parties see the 2018 midterms as a rematch of 2016, but for different reasons Democrats are hoping that Trump s victory was a fluke, a glitch in the matrix, and that their inevitable march to power will be put back on track Trump s Republicans, however, believe that 2016 was a revolution in political affairs and that their tactics will work once again The most important election ever ùis a worn out cliche, but these midterms are not your usual election That s evidenced by thesheer amount of moneyspent on them, a record $5 billion Yet it is worth recalling that in 2016, Clinton both outraised and outspent Trump, to no avail They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing, ùis a quote attributed to a famous diplomat from over 200 years ago, about a French royal dynasty It applies just as well to the American political dynasties the Clintons and the Bushes and their coteries, deposed by Trump in 2016 What they did not realize then, and do not appear to realize even now, is that their tried and tested tricks simply didn t work against Trump, who is not a professional politician and doesn t react like one Love him or hate him, agree with his policies or not, this is a fact Rather than recognize that fact and deal with it accordingly, Trump s critics just stuffed more wool into their ears and continued screaming RACIST, ùas if that invocation was somehow magical It is this sort of magical thinking that doomed the Democrats in 2016 It wasn t just bad data, or a terrible job interpreting it, but the fact that both the media and the Clinton campaign wanted to believe their own hype Instead of reporting reality, the media thought they couldcreateit So they pretended the railroading of Bernie Sanders did not happen, and confidently predicted Clinton would crush Trump Then came the night of November 8 and the shocked, stunned long faces in TV studios and at the Javits Center That right there was the perfect moment for self reflection, understanding what went wrong and where, and learning from it Instead, Clinton blamed Russia, and the media quickly followed suit The alternative would have been admitting they had made a mistake, after all Today, they argue that history shows the ruling party always loses the first midterms Fair enough, but history also shows the incumbent party going strong when the economy is good and by the standards accepted by the media, that s observably the case So what we get are headlines along the lines of Economy has never been better; This is why it s bad and also Trump s fault ù Remember it was Hillary Clinton who first used the phrase fake news ù? Yet it was Trump who flipped the script, so to say, associating the phrase mainly with CNN and other mainstream outlets, to their perpetual frustration It s not the first oronly attackthat s backfired Who can forget Hillary Clinton dismissing Trump supporters as the basket of deplorables racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic Islamophobic you name it ùand irredeemable ù? She also insisted that they are not America ùThat worked out so well, didn t it? Who, now, remembers Russiagate ù? Yet in the months after the 2016 election, the media spoke of little else, giving airtime and column space to every grifter who pitched a narrative about evil Kremlins ùsubverting our democracy ùwith Twitter ads, or something As details emerged about the origins of the Steele Dossier, its role in the spying on Trump s campaign and the text messages between FBI lovebirds entrusted with the task well, notice how the Russia ùstory has been conspicuously absent of late?

probably haven t heard of Aleksey Pushkov He s an influential academic, politician, and media personality who once ran the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Duma (the lower house of the parliament) and is widely considered to be close to the Kremlin In the early hours of Monday morning, as the extent of Vladimir Putin s latest presidential victory became clear, he took to Twitter to make a very important point: western demonization of Putin inspires the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this ù Influential Russian politician & commentator Alexei Pushkov says western demonization of Putin causes the opposite effect in Russia Instead, citizens rally around him And the election results confirm this https:// tdotco /IPgDfW8Zsb Pushkov is correct Because Putin s latest landslide was partially made in the West To understand why, we need to rewind the clock to 2011 Back then, on the surface at least, Russia was doing well economically The ruble was trading around 30 to the US dollar and the price of oil was high While the country s reliance on the latter resource was always a poor long term strategy, it provided easy money And this meant Russians could afford to travel to places, and buy imported products, which Soviet citizens could only have dreamed of, two decades earlier Despite this, a considerable amount of people weren t happy And when the sitting president, Dmitry Medvedev, announced in September that he was stepping aside to support Putin s (who was serving as prime minister) return to the Kremlin, anger grew in some sections of society, especially the pro business and liberal factions You see, for them, Medvedev represented the promise of liberalization and westernization, and the return of Putin was seen as a step backwards towards nationalism, conservatism, and even authoritarianism In December, the Duma election took place, with United Russia, the party associated with Putin and Medvedev, failing to win a majority of the vote Some alleged the contest had been falsified and the party s real share was even smaller READ MORE:America s elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world As a result, protests kicked off, largely centered in Moscow But there were also demonstrations in many provincial cities, including Khabarovsk, more than 8,000km from Moscow, where I resided at the time At this moment, one thing was very clear: many Russians sought a new sense of identity, and the various post Soviet factions were heading for a showdown One which took place over the following months In December, the Western media had decided to christen the unrest as the Snow Revolution , amemewhich conjured memories of similar events in Ukraine and Georgia, labelled Orange and Rose respectively And this was a serious error because Russians weren t looking for the overthrow of their state And, at least in the heartland, many feared a return to the anarchy of the 1990s Thus, while certain capital city circles sizzled with talk of revolution, where I was living, people seemed horrified by the very idea This is the rich Moscow elite marching, these guys have nothing in common with me, ù was a typical statement While others seemed to think the protestors were ungrateful, because, after all, their very prosperity was mostly down to Putin, who had inherited a basket case economy in 2000 and greatly improved living standards Nevertheless, things became very tense for a while, with no less a figure than Mikhail Gorbachev publiclycallingfor Putin to resign † Of course, Putin didn t heed Gorby s call Instead, he continued his presidential campaign and in March 2012, won handsomely, with a score of 63% nationally, but only 46% in Moscow Now, this is where I need to explain something: the 2011/12 protests were, more or less, a big smoke ù phenomenon And it explains † why Western media correspondents, who are all based in Moscow and have little understanding of the rest of Russia, beyond itsoccasionalnovelty value, made their readers and viewers believe something substantial was stirring when the reality was less dramatic Because, in a place like Khabarovsk, the movement gained no traction beyond a bit of muttering in cafes and between close family and friends Putin realized this and learned a lesson In his first two terms, he d probably spent too much time worrying about the Moscow elite From now on, he was going to focus on his base, the ordinary folk who keep Russia working And little did he know at the time, but the West was about to lend a helping hand The KremlinbelievedHillary Clinton had interfered in Russia s 2011/12 unrest, but her influence was limited, even if Putin s team regarded it as a betrayal However, America s behavior in Ukraine in 2013/14 was another matter entirely This was the US openly intervening in street protests in Russia s neighbor and Clinton s former assistant secretary of state,Victoria Nuland, was leading the charge eventually even going so far aschoosinga new government in the aftermath For Russians, it was incredible Ukraine, home to entire regions where ethnic Russians constitute a significant majority, was, as they saw it, being destabilized in a Western backed coup Something which meant that Crimea, part of Russia for hundreds of years until Nikita Khrushchev signed it away in the 1950s, could have feasibly wound up housing NATO bases Thus, when Putin decided to reabsorb the peninsula in the spring of 2014, his popularity ratings reached unprecedented levels Because Russians believed the West had betrayed them And, since then, the EU and the US have played into his hands Russians are fully aware of Western scaremongering about their country and the demonization of their president They see it on news sites, across social media, and on TV And the ones who can t understand English can even read Russian translations of the Western press on a dedicated website, Inosmi (which, incidentally, is state funded) Furthermore, in addition to the constant barrage of media delirium, the NATO countries sanctions policy has created a besieged fortress mentality in Russia Indeed, Andrey Kondrashov, Putin s campaign spokesman, summed this up on Sunday night Turnout is higher than we expected, by about 8 10 percent, for which we must say thanks to Great Britain, ù hesaidwith tongue surely in cheek, referring to the fallout from a spy poisoning drama in the UK We were pressured exactly at the moment when we needed to mobilize [voters] Whenever Russia is accused of something indiscriminately and without any evidence, the Russian people unite around the center of power And the center of power is certainly Putin today ù In 2012, Putin was under pressure in Moscow, but this weekend he secured over 70% of the vote in thecapital And in St Petersburg, where he managed 58% six years ago, he can now boast a 75% score And it has happened at a time when Russians have endured a deep recession, with falling real wages, during a painful, but necessary, economic restructuring after the previous resource driven model exhausted itself Today, even liberal, educated, and cosmopolitan dwellers of the two big cities generally support the status of Crimea and now resent the West for its anti Russia hysteria Whereas in 2011 12, many saw the US as a country to aspire to, now they are disappointed with Washington and believe the US to be fundamentally opposed to respecting any of Russia s vital interests READ MORE:Putin s landslide victory to attract additional $30bn to Russian economy Thus, ironically, a Western policy aimed at weakening Putin and reducing Russian resolve has completely backfired Eighteen years after he first entered the Kremlin, the president s position has never been stronger, or more secure And he can thank the dysfunctional and self destructive policy of the United States and the European Union A lot of which is influenced

than any equivalent Trump Russia collusion Both pale in comparison to Washington s meddling in the former USSR But the US media focuses on the most illusory of the situations Bryan MacDonald is an

Ireland on Sunday, and The Irish Daily Mail Follow him on Twitter@27khv It s pretty obvious Donald Trump Jr isn t the brightest light in the firmament The lethargic, spoiled and languid persona he projects doesn t help either Nevertheless, the current hysteria surrounding his meeting a small time Russian lawyer is beyond any bounds of reason Especially coming from journalists who have surely met a dodgy source or two in their time, in the hope of a scoop Natalia Veselnitskaya was almost certainly not representing the Kremlin when she courted baby Trump Rather she waslobbyingon behalf of a client, mixed up in the Sergei Magnitsky case To that end, the ex UK tabloid hack Robert Goldstoneexaggeratedher usefulness to attract Donald Jr s attention By Trump s own account, he quickly sussed this distorted pretext and pulled back Plus, it s worth mentioning how she s also engaged plenty ofDemocratsas part of her campaign Nevertheless, certain media elements have been guilty of greater inflation than Veselnitskaya Including theNew York Times, which laughably labeled her a fearsome Moscow insider, ùwithout explaining how it was Moscow Oblast, not Moscow city, where she enjoyed this clout Because despite the shared name, the region and the metropolis are two different entities, roughly analogous to the relationship between Virginia and Washington DC Thus, the Times misleading headline was much the same as a Russian outlet hailing a Richmond based attorney as some kind of White House specialist There is another thing which makes this endless Trump Russia delirium even more dubious And that s how the US establishment will leap on any connection, no matter how vague, concerning the President s team and Russians, but ignores dealings between the democraticparty and Ukraine The elephant in the room which has been almost completely ignored, and was amazingly not even mentioned when Petro Poroshenko visited Washington last month Let s be clear, Ukraine feared a Trump presidency Because, on the campaign trail, the candidate had openly suggestedrecognizingRussia s reabsorption of Crimea and spoke of the Donbass crisis as a problem for Europe, not America As a result, Kiev bet the house on Hillary Clinton And lost As Politicoreportedin January: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election And they helped Clinton s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers ù Now, this is pretty explosive stuff A credible American news organization is reporting how a foreign government directly interfered in the US election But the popular press didn t pursue the story Presumably, because its runs counter to the established narrative A Ukrainian American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort, and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation, ùthe piece continued The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia ù And here was the zinger: Politico s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections ù Later, Politicofocusedon the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American activist, who admitted acting as a link between Ukraine s Washington Embassy and the Democratic National Committee And also how Sergei Leshchenko, elected in 2014 as an MP for Poroshenko s party, had offered ledgers purportedly showing connections between Trump and Manafort before urging Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort ùIncidentally, Manafort has always been especially appalled at attempts to link his work to Russia, saying all my efforts were focused on helping Ukraine move into Europe and the West ù Leschenko wasn t coy about his intentions He openly admitted trying toexposeTrump as a pro Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world, ùby preferring Moscow to Ukraine Furthermore, as The Atlantic noted: the investigation into the payments listed in the ledger îwhich in April were partially corroborated by theAPthrough wire transfers that Manafort claimed were legitimate îmysteriously faded after the U S election, raising questions about whether Ukrainian officials aired concerns about Manafort less to root out corruption than to undermine the Trump campaign ù Overall, Democrat Ukraine collusion seems far deeper than anything so far proven between the Trump campaign and Russia For instance, Donald Jr stands exposed as having been willing to meet someone described as affiliated with the Kremlin to get information on Hillary, which was pretty dumb The meeting itself appeared to be a bait and switch so the lawyer could lobby on other matters However, the Ukraine story involved a concerted and deliberate campaign, including cooperation between Kiev representatives and the Clinton camp to research Trump Kremlin connections Thus, If the issue is collusion, it s obvious there was much greater connivance concerning Ukraine and the Democrats than a single exchange involving Donald Jr and an insignificant lawyer One where no information was actually provided That said, American outrage over meddling from Kiev and Moscow is laughable in the context of Washington s long history of interference in both countries politics In 1996, the US openly intervened in Russia s election to help Boris Yeltsin defeat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov And in 2011, Washington officials, including Clinton, publicly supported a protest campaign over disputed parliamentary elections The following year,Michael McFaularrived as ambassador to Moscow and unabashedly courted fringe opposition leaders in his very first event in the role In Ukraine, the interruptions have had even more serious consequences By the admission of Victoria Nuland, a member of the Obama administration, Washington spent over$5 billionon influence projects in the country The first regime change ùoperation came in 2004 and was known as the orangerevolution ùAnd in 2013, US politicians and officials, such as John McCain and Nuland herself, turned up in Kiev to encourage the Maidan movement, in which the USambassadorGeoffrey Pyatt was prominent That led to the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government, which divided the country and caused the separation of Crimea and a civil war in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions And it also contributed to an economic collapse which has seen the average Ukrainian salary fall to around $200 a month and led to unprecedented levels of emigration For sure, Ukrainians didn t hide their hostility toTrump Interior Minister Arsen Avakov deriding the eventual winner as a dangerous marginal ùanddescribinghim as a clown ùon Twitter Many Russians publicly slammed Clinton, which was hardly surprising after shecomparedVladimir Putin to Hitler The fact remains there is no evidence of a direct Kremlin campaign to undermine America s election The media has

 Yanukovich government in Kiev and lock Ukraine into the EU and,
 ultimately, NATO Washington s agenda has little to do with democracy and freedom , and a lot to do with
 destabilizing Putin s Russia On Sunday, January 19, the eight week long series of protests and
 demonstrations against the government of President Viktor
 Yanukovich in Kiev escalated to a new level of violence Bands of
 right wing militants called Pravy Sektor (Right Sector), attacked
 Ukrainian police guarding government buildings and attempting to
 contain the protesters Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at riot police from the top
 of the Dynamo Kiev football stadium in central Kiev beginning
 January 19 Police responded by using stun grenades and tear gas
 against the mobs Vehicles were torched by the hooligans from the
 neo Nazi Pravy Sektor More than 60 police were hospitalized from
 barrages of rocks, stones and Molotov cocktails The core of Pravy sektor is made of the activists of radical
 groups, including Trizub , Patriot of Ukraine ,as
 well as UNA UNSO and the Svoboda (Freedom) ultra right
 party, which won nearly 10 percent of votes at the last
 parliamentary election in Ukraine They are pro EU The far right violent radicals told Radio Free Europe, a US
 Government media agency tied to the CIA and State Department,
 that they were preparing full bloody guerrilla war against the
 government Andrey Tarasenko, Pravy Sektor s coordinator warned, If they attack and try to carry out a bloody crackdown, I
 think there will be a massacre Guerrilla warfare will begin in
 Ukraine Tarasenko stated that their demands ùare to oust the
 current government and build a nation state in
 Ukraine What kind of nation state we must imagine They also
 demand that Yanukovich step down, but, generously enough, add
 that they would give him and his family 24 hours to leave
 the country safely ù On their VKontakte (In Contact) social network website, the
 organization calls for donations of items such as slingshots,
 steel balls, gasoline, laser pointers, glass bottles, chains, and
 pyrotechnics Their published manifesto is nothing short of bizarre: All
 those who at this point would try to tame the revolutionary
 energy of the masses should be proclaimed traitors and punished
 in the most severe way The time of peaceful singing and dancing
 at Maidan [Independence Square] is over This is a waste of time 
 There can be no negotiations, no compromise with the ruling gang 
 We will carry high the fire of national revolution ù Curious is the fact that in the beginning of the protests, Pravy
 Sektor members were calling themselves the Maidan
 self defense force They had been designated by the main
 opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk and Oleg
 Tyagnibok to provide security for peaceful protesters Now they
 clearly have split from the peaceful protests Even more bizarre is the fact that in recent days ambassadors of
 several EU member states, as well as the US and Canada have gone
 to Maidan to meet Pravy Sektor activists and learn how the
 headquarters of national resistance operates Instead of unequivocally condemning the rise of violent Ukrainian
 nationalism, which could turn Ukraine into another Yugoslavia or
 Libya, the West is only threatening President Yanukovich with
 sanctions, while turning a blind eye to the real Pravy Sektor
 danger The Tarasenko demands are virtually the same as ex boxer turned
 right wing politician, Vitaly Klitschko, the pro EU apparent
 favorite of Germany s Merkel government Klitschko has lived in
 Germany for the past several years The nominal reason for the latest explosive protests in Ukraine
 was passage of a series of emergency laws to control the civil
 disorder by the Parliament on January 16 which, among other
 things, restrict the right to protest, constrain independent
 media, and inhibit the operation of NGOs Evidence suggests that key players in the Ukraine protest
 movement are being steered and orchestrated by Washington funded
 NGO s like the National Endowment for Democracy, the German
 Marshall Fund in The United States (a Washington think tank
 financed by a donation from the German Parliament), and certain
 key neo conservative Bush Cheney leftovers in senior positions at
 the State Department Already on October 11, 2011, the German Marshall Fund hosted
 Vitaly Klitschko, then WBC Heavyweight Boxing Champion just
 entering Ukraine s political boxing ring, at a Washington meeting
 to discuss Ukraine s European perspective Again in 2012 during the October Ukraine elections The German
 Marshall Fund in the United States hosted a top level group of
 UK, French and German journalists to visit Ukraine, where they
 also met Klitschko The Marshall Fund journalists were told by
 the US Embassy officials in Kiev that, Ukrainian oligarchs
 would like to see a strong opposition to the Party of Regions in
 the new parliament in order to temper the enrichment of President
 Yanukovich s family ù That strong opposition is today headed by three very
 different political parties One which won a shocking 10 percent
 in the last elections and sits in parliament is Svoboda, a
 neo fascist nationalist party led by Oleg Tyagnibok Tyagnibok
 backed the US financed 2004 orangerevolution He is openly
 anti Semitic and anti Russian, once claiming that Ukraine was
 ruled by a Moscow Jewish mafia ùThe second largest
 opposition party, jailed opposition figure, Yulia Tymoshenko s Fatherland , led by Arseny Yatsenyuk, has signed an
 agreement to work with the neo fascist Svoboda The opposition figure most attractive to the West is ex boxer
 Klitschko, head of UDAR (strike), the smallest opposition party,
 who has spent the last years living in Germany In order to have
 a chance at a Parliamentary majority in 2015, Klitschko will be
 forced to make a coalition with Svoboda and its policies, even
 though he is trying a delicate tightrope act of claiming to
 distance from Svoboda s anti Semitic ultra nationalism In an Op Ed in the London Financial Times, Klitschko wrote, the official halt in Ukraine s European integration unmasks
 the true face ùof the Yanukovich regime î a cartel of
 commercial self interests that has captured public office and
 believes that political longevity can be bought by selling
 Ukraine s interests ùUkrainians, he warned, would not allow
 Yanukovich and his cronies to steal their future ùand
 if their views were not taken into account, more protests
 are yet to come ù A central role in encouraging the Ukraine protesters is being
 played by the US State Department, and especially Victoria
 Nulland A review of the official statements from Nulland, who met
 personally with opposition leader Klitschko in early December, is
 instructive of the open interference of Washington in the
 internal affairs of Ukraine Nulland a Hillary Clinton
 appointee who now is assistant secretary of the Bureau of
 European and Eurasian Affairs in the State Department did not
 respect a sovereign decision by Ukraine s government in November
 2013 not to accept the dismal terms offered by Brussels for a
 Ukrainian EU Association status The EU offer would have forced Ukraine to open its
 economy to free market rules in return for little 
 When Yanukovich told the EU of his government s decision in
 November, Nulland s spokesperson issued the following statement: We continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian
 people to achieve a prosperous European democracy European
 integration is the surest course to economic growth and
 strengthening Ukraine s democracy ùThat was an undiplomatic
 intervention on the side of the protesters designed to embolden
 the opposition It did indeed Then on December 5 in Kiev, after her meeting with Vitaly
 Klitschko, Nulland declared, There should be no doubt about
 where the United States stands on this We stand with the people
 of Ukraine who see their future in Europe ¶ ù She followed her speech with a high profile bizarre media
 photo op where she carried a single plastic bag of food to give
 to the opposition demonstrators Nulland s partisan pro EU
 comments were followed by a brazen appearance from Republican
 war hawk Senator John McCain a few days later, siding with the
 opposition in December McCain is chairman of the Board of
 National Endowment for Democracy s International Republican
 Institute, which has been in the middle of all US Color
 Revolution destabilizations since 2000 Most recently, on January 15, after attacking Russia for granting
 a vital $15 billion bond purchase to help stabilize Ukraine,
 Nulland all but outlined the standard US government template for
 election tampering that has been done in countless color
 revolutions since the NED s 2000 coup against Yugoslavia s
 Milosevic She told the US Senate, the use of violence and acts of
 repression carried out by government security forces and their
 surrogates have compelled us to make clear publicly and privately
 to the government of Ukraine that we will consider a broad range
 of tools at our disposal if those in positions of authority in
 Ukraine employ or encourage violence against their own
 citizens ù Nulland then issued a direct order to President Yanukovich: We call on him to make it credible through concrete actions
 to restore government accountability, rule of law and engagement
 with Europe and the IMF ùThen, referencing planned 2015
 national Ukraine elections, she added, US pre election
 assistance to Ukraine likely will include programs to support
 citizen oversight of the campaign environment and the conduct of
 the elections, independent media coverage and informed civic
 awareness and participation ùAnd finally, The State
 Department and USAID are reviewing how best to support Ukrainian
 civil society and media ù USAID is widely cited as a cover for CIA operations in foreign
 countries Victoria Nulland herself is a former assistant to Vice President
 Dick Cheney, and married to neo conservative guru, Robert Kagan 
 She was under fire when caught recently lying to the American
 people when she was Hillary Clinton s State Department
 spokesperson Nulland pushed her superiors then to completely
 delete numerous references of extremists linked to Al Qaeda in
 Benghazi and eastern Libya after the assassination of the US
 Ambassador She also persuaded more senior officials to delete
 information on at least five other attacks against foreign
 interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants Washington is clearly out to destabilize the new Ukraine Russia
 economic cooperation by hook or crook On January 22, after
 severe Pravy Sektor violence, the American Embassy in Kiev
 announced it was revoking the visas of several unnamed Ukraine
 Government officials responsible for actions taken against
 protesters in November and December The latest negotiations between the Yanukovich government and the
 three main opposition party leaders îKlitschko, Arseny Yatsenyuk
 and Oleg Tyagnibok îhave led to the resignation of Yanukovich s
 Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov and his cabinet, and changes in the
 emergency laws proposed 10 days earlier Nine out of 12
 anti protest laws passed January 16 were repealed At this point, whatever agenda Victoria Nulland s State
 Department may have had in trying to woo Ukraine away from
 Moscow, the internal forces of instability, egged on by vocal
 support from the West, have made the outcome incalculable That
 is certainly not in the true interest of the EU, having a
 critical Central European nation of 45 million ungovernable, and
 a rising nationalist fascist Svoboda led party calling the shots

Well, McFaul is a professional He never fails to pick the right people In 2006, the project Da! ù initiated by Navalny and Gaidar, started receiving donations from the National Endowment for Democracy (McFaul is still on the NED s board of directors) As part of the program to initiate an orange coup ù in Russia, McFaul sent Navalny to study at the Yale University as part of the Yale World Fellows program in 2010 After a thorough comparison of the psychoanalytical portrait (apparently, for reflexive governance purposes) of a Russian Viktor Yushchenko, huge foreign grants were opened Therefore, the author of the Aleksey Navalny project is none other than Michael McFaul Maria Gaidar has temporarily fell out of the race (went to study in the United States) after a major scandal in Kirov surrounding her name (Maria Gaidar was allegedly involved in a car crash causing the death of a 13 year old girl) Immediately after his arrival in Moscow on January 14, Michael McFaul got down to business very actively He carried out several meetings with opposition leaders (January 17 and 22), addressed the public live on Echo of Moscow radio a media stronghold of the Russian liberals Then on January 25 he gave an interview to the influential Kommersant newspaper, and on January 30 he participated in Vladimir Pozner s TV show on nationwide Channel One Aside from media publicity, he started working thoroughly on making anti Putin rallies in Moscow more creatively (together with the founder of the oppositional Novaya Gazeta, former president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev) It seemed that the February 4 rally was bound for success However, the reshuffle in the Kremlin at the end of December 2011 led to a change in Vladimir Putin s election campaign strategy and the beginning of real counter actions to the anti Putin information campaign Also on February 4, despite the freeze of minus 20 degrees Celsius, Poklonnaya Hill saw a huge rally Though it is even hard to breathe in such cold weather, around 140,000 people gathered together, according to police And this is a big achievement of the new head of Vladimir Putin s election campaign Vyacheslav Volodin (First Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office) †So, McFaul has lost, but he has lost only in the first round of this confrontation Time has shown that he knows how to withstand pressure, quickly gets adjusted to a changing situation, and he obviously has some secret plans of how to put the Aleksey Navalny project into life So, it is too early for the Kremlin to relax the fight to prevent chaos and to preserve the Russian statehood is yet to come Prof Igor Panarin, Doctor of Political Sciences, special to RT",https://www.rt.com/russia/mcfaul-opposition-rallies-panarin-667/

"25 Feb, 2010",West is idle regarding Russian proposals ‚Äì Lavrov,"The new EU Security Treaty is a test for Russia s European partners on how sincere they are, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in an interview with RT, the Voice of Russia ù radio channel and RIA Novosti Elaborating on the new European security concept, he said, that what Russia suggests is nothing new and it goes to the collective political statements at the top level of NATO member countries and the work of Russia NATO council in late 1990s, which approved the European Security Charter stating that security is indivisible and no country should improve its security at the expense of other countries in the Euro Atlantic zone But mere declarations do not work, believes Sergey Lavrov, because NATO s new Strategic Concept operates with the possibility of military strikes without UN sanction, and all this is happening as the alliance isgetting closer to Russia s borders, even though it promised not to do so in the past The current security structures were created in a different era for different purposes, ùLavrov said, yet at the same time we see NATO s centralizing power getting stronger and stronger in response to today s threats, which are generally accepted as totally different to what we saw 50 or 60 years ago as a threat ù We do not think it is logical and consider it as a contradictory approach, ùhe added For those who recognize the ideas Russia s proposals consist of, but do not want to be engaged in practical work on the proposals, Lavrov quoted an unnamed European politician and decision maker, who explained the difference between political obligations and legally binding ones by allegedly saying that legally binding statements have to be observed, while it is not necessary to observe mere political declarations ù This is the general reason why our Western partners are not disposed at the moment to sit at the table and start discussing our proposals in detail, ùconcluded the Russian FM The minister said that any regional security system should be part of a global system and thus European security system is fully legitimate We do not believe that the European security system will pose a threat to Asian or African or any other countries It is fully in line with principles recorded in the UN Charter, ùhe said Mr Lavrov said that NATO, in its attempt to adapt to current international situation, sometimes goes beyond the limits of what is legitimate ù Speaking about thetalks on a new START treaty, Russia s Foreign Minister admitted that there are still delays in the negotiation process due to bureaucracy We criticize bureaucracy from time to time At the political level some decisions are made and then it takes a long time to transform them into some practical actions, ùSergey Lavrov said Mr Lavrov then assured that both Russian and American leaders are working closely on the START treaty The most important point to consider in the course of these negotiations is the link between strategic and offensive weapons This means that, first and foremost, they should consider the link between strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive weapons, the link between the START treaty and missile defense This was also discussed during their meeting in London on the margins of the G20 summit Also, the same understanding was recorded in the document they signed last [year] in Moscow So there is no change in this matter on our side and we expect that American negotiators will preserve this link the way it has been agreed, ùthe minister asserted The Russian FM also stressed the importance of the principle of parity to finally strike the deal He said that the two parties should trust each other and not resort to some extensive additional verification Also, our presidents agreed that the treaty will be parity based All measures of verification will not be excessive because it s a different era today We shouldn t be as suspicious as before, ùhe said Measures taken for control and verification should be equal for everybody, they should be parity based as the presidents have agreed So these are the main areas of work, ùMr Lavrov iterated Mr Lavrov said that the rest of the technicalities can be addressed within the framework of the main principles and that there is nothing in the way of negotiators After the recent contacts that we had between ourGeneva delegations, the day before yesterday I talked to Hilary Clinton on the phone, and yesterday there was atelephone conversation between our presidents,so I think that after these contacts we ll have a constructive political dialogue not substituted by anything else We ll be strictly following the instructions given by our presidents, especially now that Chief of the General staff, General Makarov, and his American counterpart Admiral Mullen also had understanding when they met in Moscow in December ù The FM finally said that though the START treaty is 95 per cent ready, there are still some points to take into account So I would not diminish the work that remains because the treaty is actually 95 per cent ready, but let s not forget that we still have a 200 page protocol addendum to this treaty that includes some strictly military data, ùhe added The reason why we emphasize that the new START treaty should be linked to missile defense is because it is being developed now, in the situation when there is no new ABM treaty, ùLavrov outlined Mr Lavrov said that Russia welcomed President Obama s decision to give up on the missile defense system plan of the Bush administration because it affected Russian security directly He said that President Obama confirmed in his telephone conversation with President Medvedev that the USA will develop an anti missile system aimed at neutralizing threats from medium range to short range missiles It poses no threat to Russia But the plan that they are developing now still implies that towards the end of this decade, maybe in 2017, 2018, the United States may have a global strategic scale And we are interested how this is going to function, ùsaid the minister If this becomes a really global antimissile defense system, this will once again pose a threat to the Russian Federation and we would like to be ready for that and, if possible, prevent this from happening ù That is why, the minister said, Russia has openly expressed concerns about the US anti missile system The two countries have agreed toanalyze missile threats togetheron a bilateral basis Moreover, any other interested country is welcome This is something that Russia proposed back in 1992, but at that time nobody really considered Russia a serious partner ù The minister stressed that Russia wants to have a say in the matter This time we remind again: it is very important to analyze and decide where the threat comes from We don t want to be neglected, ùhe noted What Russia deems as of vital importance is joint analysis of the threats Once we have a common understanding of those risks, we can consider what diplomatic, political and economic measures we may take, and if all of the above is insufficient, then we can take some military and technical measures, ùhe said Russia welcomes that the US seems to share its approach However, some steps taken by the USA still can be called unilateral They announce that they will deploy missile defense and air defense elements inPoland, Romania and Bulgaria, then they deny these reports, then they confirm these reports Of course we have questions in this situation and we are very frank about it, ùsaid the minister Mr Lavrov also referred to the speech of EU high representative Catherine Ashton at theMunich security conference, who emphasized that more parties should be involved in the decision making process on strategic issues And then she emphasized starting with developing a common strategy together Not waiting until the point of implementation when you already have a strategy and you don t have enough resources to implement it, and only then do you get somebody involved, ùhe recalled The minister said that this view fully coincides with Russia s position He reminded that there is no legal mechanism now to restrict missile proliferation Not all countries are eager to join voluntary clubs, like the treaty between the US and Russia banning short range and medium range missiles The minister said that at the time of the Bush administration, Russia put forward the proposal to the UN to make the above treaty universal, but it did not happen, noting, We want to repeat the same call once again more insistently ù Mr Lavrov said that it is urgent to limit the spread of missile technology and to make the process transparent This approach fully matches Russia s aspirations Russia may support further sanctions against Iran, but will be very cautious about the goals such sanctions would seek, said Lavrov He reminded that Russia, as a member of the UN Security Council, had supported sanctions against Teheran in the past Those had been implemented at the request of the IAEA, which had good historical reasons, and had nothing to do with suspicions over the possible military application of Iran s nuclear program Iran had been doing nuclear research for almost 20 years secretly, without notifying the IAEA and in violation of Iran s commitments under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty Of course, every country has the right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program, but must notify the IAEA when it does so, ùreminded the Russian foreign minister It was Iran s violation of its obligations and its failure later to clearly answer some of the IAEA s questions over its nuclear research, which prompted the Security Council to impose sanctions against some organizations and persons involved in the program The sanctions are to motivate Teheran to make the program fully transparent Admittedly it has not done this so far, added Lavrov Moreover, in SeptemberIran gave an unpleasant surpriseto the IAEA and the world community by revealing a new enrichment facility near Qum, which it had been constructing secretly This does not help to dispel concerns over itsnuclear activities We, as a member of the UN Security Council, have no doubt that Iran has rights just like any other non nuclear signatories of the NNPT, including the right to enrich uranium But Iran has to respect the obligations which come with these rights Namely, to answer the IAEA s questions on their program, ùLavrov said He added: Taking into account the lack of progress here and the fact that the Iranian leadership does not respond to constructive and compromise initiatives over the enrichment schemes, which would provide nuclear fuel for the Iranian research reactor, the UN Security Council may re consider the situation ù At the same time, sanctions cannot be an end in themselves And the non proliferation regime cannot be used as pretext for economically strangling and alienating Iran Russia would not back proposals in the Security Council which go beyond the goals of nuclear non proliferation Answering a question about possible restoration of relations with Georgia, badly damaged by the aggression of the latter against South Ossetia in 2008, Sergey Lavrov said that the current regime in Georgia has persistently done everything it could to incite enmity between the Russian and Georgian people ù Georgia s current president, Mikhail Saakashvili, is acting to purposely separate our nations, Lavrov said I am sure he will never succeed, he or those who manipulate him, ùadded FM That is why Russia is not going to deal with Saakashvili, whom the Russian leadership believes to be a criminal that ordered the killing of people in South Ossetia and violated all international UN charters, as well as an agreement Georgia signed to establish peace in South Ossetia Still, Sergey Lavrov expressed hope that the two countries will resume regularflights between Moscow and Tbilisi The border crossing will start functioning on March 1 if the Georgian side does not change its mind, ùhe underlined We have no doubt that the ties between Russian and Georgian people, which are centuries old, are much stronger than the problems brought to our relations by alien winds, ùLavrov added The Russian FM pointed out that none of the post Soviet Georgian leaders have been able to take into account the interests of their own people and live in peace with people whom they considered their own, rejecting the right for autonomy for non Georgians on Georgia s territory Considering that the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been living in peace with us like brothers for centuries, we could not stay away and we will do everything we can to make sure their security is not threatened, ùpromised Lavrov He stressed that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are not Russia s geopolitical project, so international recognition is not of primary importance in this case The only thing we considered was how to protect civilians according to international agreements ù Lavrov pointed out that Western political analysts jump to fast geopolitical conclusions and speculate about these two countries independence The main geopolitical conclusion is that the current architecture of European security has a serious flaw, and this is not the first time The first time was when, during the Kosovo crisis, without any sanction of the UN Security Council, in violation of all OSCE documents, a number of OSCE member states attacked another country¬† ì a member of the OSCE, ùLavrov recalled Then there was theunilaterally proclaimed independenceof Kosovo, which was a gross violation of Helsinki Final Act ù What happened in South Ossetia is also a major break down of this system, ùhe added Lavrov observed that President Dmitry Medvedev s initiative on European Security was introduced not after the war in South Ossetia, but before it, in June 2008, when the Russian president was on a visit in Berlin The Russian FM promised that Russia will continue to improve the legal framework with Abkhazia and South Ossetia and resolve all issues in a calm atmosphere Speaking about another former Soviet state Ukraine, Sergey Lavrov said that for the last five years, Russia has been working to prevent accumulation of the problems in Russian Ukrainian relations and settle those problems already existing, remarked the head of Russia s Foreign Ministry Many things were done by the Ukrainian leadership to practically ruin our relationship, no matter what they say, ùSergey Lavrov stated CallingNazi collaborator Stepan Banderaa Hero of Ukraine is way too much ù and serves a good illustration as to how far certain Ukrainian politicians will go in order to prevent Russia and Ukraine from living together as friends Russia is sticking to a pragmatic line, free of political speculations in its relations with Ukraine, developing economic ties first of all, by signing agreements on airplane manufacturing, gas issues etc Our dialogue is no longer politicized, it is a professional dialogue and we re trying to find common ground, ùshared Sergey Lavrov As for theelection of a new president in Ukraine, the Russian FM said that the people of Ukraine simply made their choice and expressed their view on what was going on ù Many people supported the new president Viktor Yanukovich, but there is still a large group of voters that voted against him Nevertheless, now there is a good opportunity to consolidate Ukrainian society and the Ukrainian people based on respect for the Ukrainian constitution and national interests, which has not been the case over the last five years, ùunderlined Lavrov Russia needs a pro Ukrainian leader of the Ukrainian state, ùbecause such a president would think about the interests of the Ukrainian people ""And if he does think about them, he will undoubtedly think about having close ties with the Russian Federation and the other neighbors, ùsaid Russia s foreign minister There is no choice between Russia and Europe, as the leaders of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and some politicians in Europe have tried to misrepresent the situation This goes against all principles of European co operation they speak so much about, ùLavrov pointed out Despite the well known problems inRussia Ukraine relations, we have every reason to go on and resolve them based on mutual respect and a parity of interests, ùLavrov concluded The CIS has always been a political platform for the countries leaders to come together and openly discuss issues Recently, the organization has started to explore its economic potential When the financial crisis broke out, this interest became even more practical, ùhe noted A new institution, the Meeting of Finance Ministers, has started to function within the framework of the CIS This meeting has approved crisis management program that supplements other documents, such as the strategy of CIS economic development until 2020 The minister also spoke about the new system of presidency in the CIS, which was introduced asCIS activitiesare becoming more and more effective This year Russia is the chairman across all these institutions Mr Lavrov said that, according to the new mechanism of work of the CIS, one or two subjects have been chosen as the focus of attention This year the priority is innovation and the importance of achieving a break through in this area is obvious to all CIS countries, including Russia, ùsaid the minister This year has also been announced the year of veterans by the CIS countries Some more decisions to support veterans will be made It is a good combination, I would say: going back to our common history on the one hand¬† ì because we can t get away from our common history¬† ì and at the same time we are realizing that in addition to our common historic and cultural routes we have some real interest today to use the economic opportunities we have to enhance our socio economic situation, to make our economies innovative, to achieve a breakthrough in the economy, ùMr Lavrov observed Touching upon perspectives of international cooperation, Lavrov said tha√É¬ê√Ç¬µ Russia s relations with China in trade and investment are very intense, and even though the crisis affected the turnover, it is a temporary factor, believes Sergey Lavrov All common economic projects are mutually beneficial and are planned for many years ahead, commented Lavrov The minister pointed out that Russia and China are partners in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Security Council of the UN as permanent members, and realize their responsibilities in full, therefore have no intentions to gang up against anyone Developing partnership and strategic interaction between Moscow and Beijing is not to the detriment of a third party, ùLavrov underlined Lavrov shared his belief that the more centers of economic growth and economic power there are in the world, the more stable the world structure is ù The Asia Pacific region today is a locomotive of global development and this historic development is only natural and is a historic trend ù As for the security in this region, Sergey Lavrov pointed out that The effort made to ensure security in a separate region should be coordinated with global security as presented in the UN charter, ùhe said, because there is no umbrella organization that would unite everybody ù The Russian FM said that security in the Asia Pacific region is extremely important in the face of terrorism and securing trade routes He came to the conclusion that We are all interested in developing security in such a way that we do not create alliances against somebody No, we need to find approaches that help us neutralize threats that are common for everybody today ù To end on a positive note, the journalists asked Mr Lavrov if he is going to followthe example of many prominent politiciansand start his own blog The minister says he does not rule out the possibility I realize that young people are more and more interested in foreign politics today And most bloggers come from among young people So it s possible, ùsaid Mr Lavrov He added that the Russian Foreign Ministry has its own website, with thousands of web pages edited every month",https://www.rt.com/russia/lavrov-security-amd-start/

in the freezing winter Soon, many frustrated workers had also had enough On October 25, a blank shot from the Aurora ù cruiser in Petrograd, today s St Petersburg, signaled the start of the revolt The seizure by the Bolsheviks of the Tsar s residence, the Winter Palace, became the revolution s defining moment To gain control of the entire country, Lenin and his backers went on to fight a bitter four year war with the Whites ù, a loose coalition of those who opposed them The Soviet Union was eventually proclaimed in 1922 Three summer days that shook the USSR For some time, the Communist Party hardliners had felt challenged by Mikhail Gorbachev s reforms In August 1991, with Gorbachev on holiday in the Crimea, they decided to act The coup came a day before the planned signing of a new union treaty that would recast the USSR as a more loosely bound connection of sovereign states With Gorbachev held under house arrest, a group of top officials, headed by his own vice president, ordered tanks into the streets of Moscow The Russian parliamentarians, led by Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected leader of the USSR s Russian Republic, rallied popular support against the coup In an iconic move, Yeltsin mounted a tank, as soldiers refused to disperse the protesters An exhausted Gorbachev returned to Moscow to find that power had swung over to Yeltsin In December, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus secretly signed accords dismantling the USSR Faced with the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned on December 25, 1991 In autumn 2004, thousands of Ukrainians poured into Kiev s Independence Square Amid claims that the November presidential poll was rigged, they demanded victory for their man † Viktor Yushchenko The battle was closely fought between the pro Western Yushchenko and the sitting Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich, who didn t hide his pro Russian stance Yanukovich was initially declared victorious Convinced that the election was stolen from the rightful winner, Yushchenko s supporters took to the streets It was dubbed the orangerevolution , with the protesters all wearing something orange † the color of Yushchenko s Our Ukraine party Yanukovich was forced to back down and lost the December re run of the poll But while Yushchenko s euphoric backers celebrated in Kiev and Ukraine s West, rallies ripped through the Russian speaking, industrialized East † Yanukovich s stronghold Some media and analysts claimed that, far from being a spontaneous drive for democracy, the Revolution was a coup financed by the West Since taking office, Yushchenko has kept to his promised course of steering Ukraine towards the EU and NATO It was dubbed to Rose Revolution In November 2003, crowds took to the streets of Georgia s capital Tbilisi to challenge the results of a parliamentary election that they believed was flawed They demanded the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze, a man who had ruled Georgia for more than 20 years, as its Soviet era Communist Party chief and its longest serving post independence president Many protesters carried long stemmed roses as a symbol of their peaceful intentions The wave of rallies reached its peak on the day the new parliament, seen as illegitimate by the demonstrators, held its opening session One of the opposition leaders, the US educated ambitious firebrand Mikheil Saakashvili, led his supporters to the parliament building They pushed their way through the thick wooden doors and interrupted a speech being given by Eduard Shevarnadze The moment Shevardnadze s bodyguards bundled him out by a back door, power changed hands in Georgia The elite military units refused to support the government Shevarnadze resigned and Mikheil Saakashvili was elected president in January 2004 On November 17, 1989 riot police crushed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague It sparked six weeks of protests that would topple the Communist government in Czechoslovakia The bloodless revolt became known as the Velvet Revolution By then, things had long been ripe for change Mikhail Gorbachev had launched his policies of glasnost ù (openness) and perestroika ù (economic restructuring), loosening the USSR s grip on the Warsaw Pact states The Soviet style regimes in Central and Eastern Europe began to wobble In the run up to November s riots, the Czechs witnessed the drama that played out in Prague s West German Embassy Trying to thread their way to the West, thousands of East Germans spent months camped in its muddy garden The Czech authorities eventually gave in, letting them pass directly to West Germany Then the Berlin Wall fell By the end of November, amid ongoing rallies, Czechoslovakia s parliament stripped the Communist Party of its leading role In June 1990, the country s first democratic parliamentary election since 1946 was held In a rapid and dramatic upheaval, the 1978 revolution transformed Iran from a monarchy to an Islamic state As Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted, the revolt caught much of the West by surprise, toppling a regime thought to be guarded by a generously financed army and security services The revolution was dominated by one man, Ayatollah Khomeini, who came to prominence by boldly criticizing the Shah s secularism and ties with the US In 1964, Khomeini was banished from the country, but he wasn t forgotten In exile, he became the acknowledged leader of the opposition There, Khomeini also shaped his revolutionary doctrine, attacking the regime s legitimacy and calling for a clerical state In 1978, huge street riots demanding the abdication of the Shah paralyzed the country The protests were drawing blood, but the monarchy was crumbling The Shah had no one to turn to but Washington for help, with no tangible results In January 1979, he fled Iran Two weeks later, Khomeini returned home in triumph In April, Iran officially became an Islamic Republic, with Khomeini as Supreme leader It was the war that made America Known as the American Revolution, it broke the thirteen North American colonies away from Britain s rule and created the United States The shot heard round the world ù fired at Lexington on April 19, 1775 started the war for American independence that ended eight and a half years later with the Treaty of Paris From the outset, the colonies were, by and large, allowed to develop with little interference from Britain Things changed in 1763, when London moved to tighten political control over the colonies, make them pay for their defense and return revenue to the mother country The measures proved extremely unpopular In April 1775, shots were exchanged by colonials and British soldiers and a revolution began The following year, the colonies adopted a Declaration of Independence, establishing the United States of America Things first looked grim for the ill trained, poorly armed American volunteers, but an alliance with France evened the strengths somewhat Several decisive victories over the British led to peace, as the Treaty of Paris formally recognized the new nation in 1783 On July 14, 1789 a mob of angry Parisians stormed the Bastille After several hours of fighting, the infamous prison fell, marking the start of the French Revolution The Seven Years War, involving all major European powers, and the American Revolution across the ocean made the Western world a volatile place The warfare took its toll on the French treasury, plunging the country into an economic crisis, while the King s absolute power became increasingly questioned Amidst the ongoing unrest, with some calling for constitutional monarchy and others wanting to do away with it altogether, the royal family tried to flee Paris in June 1791, disguised as servants Recognized and arrested, they were paraded back to Paris France was proclaimed a Republic; and Louis XVI was brought to trial and subsequently executed on January 21, 1793 The so called Reign of Terror followed, ruthlessly killing anyone deemed an enemy of the revolution The guillotine became the symbol of the bloodshed In 1799, a rising star of the army, Napoleon Bonaparte, staged a coup, effectively becoming France s next leader and, ultimately, Emperor In autumn 1973, the world s first democratically elected Marxist head of state was overthrown Chilean president Salvador Allende was replaced with General Augusto Pinochet, whose anti communist military dictatorship lasted until 1990 Opposition to Allende had been brewing for months After his election to power in 1970, his attempts to re structure the nation s economy led to runaway inflation and food shortages The crunch came in the early hours of September 11, when Chilean armed forces took control of most of the country With Allende rejecting an initial demand for his resignation, the presidential palace in Santiago was bombed and bloody fighting broke out in the city Allende died during the coup An official announcement declared that he had committed suicide with an automatic rifle, purportedly the one offered to him by Fidel Castro The US role in the coup remains controversial Files declassified during the Clinton administration detailed decisions and operations to undermine the election of Salvador Allende in 1970, and to promote the military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power On July 26, 1953, a small group of poorly armed revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro stormed the Moncada Barracks in the city of Santiago de Cuba The attack is widely seen as the launch of the Cuban Revolution, which ended with the ousting of General Fulgencio Batista s regime The assault itself proved a tremendous failure, with nearly all of the rebels having been killed or captured At his trial, Fidel Castro famously stated: History will absolve me ù, and was surprisingly released after two years He went into exile in Mexico, where he trained an army for a guerrilla war against Batista On December 2, 1956, Castro and some of his supporters returned to Cuba Their numbers were quickly slashed by Batista s soldiers, but many made their way into the mountains As the revolutionary movement grew, Batista s army was unprepared for the guerrilla style of warfare, and his troops were depleted by desertions and surrenders Eventually deeming the situation hopeless, Batista fled the country on January 1, 1959 After a long victory march, Castro entered Havana several days later, bringing his military triumph to a close",https://www.rt.com/russia/ten-worlds-greatest-power/
